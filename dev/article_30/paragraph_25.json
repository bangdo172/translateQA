As the First Intifada gathered momentum and Palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising, the Brotherhood announced the formation of <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><b6_0>HAMAS<b6_0/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/> (\"zeal\"), devoted to Jihad against Israel. Rather than being more moderate than the PLO, the 1988 Hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand, calling for <a2_1>the <a2_0><a2_2><b7_0>destruction of Israel<b7_0/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> and the establishment of an Islamic state in <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><b8_0>Palestine<b8_0/><a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>. It was soon competing with and then overtaking the PLO for control of the intifada. The Brotherhood's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><b9_0>alcohol<b9_0/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/> and going about without hijab."}
