Many such engines have been designed, from the time of James Watt to the present day, but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production; see link at bottom of article for more details. The major problem is the <b6_0>difficulty of sealing the rotors<b6_0/> to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><b5_0>thermal expansion<b5_0/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient. Lack of expansive working, or any means of control of the cutoff is also a serious problem with many such designs.[citation needed]"}
