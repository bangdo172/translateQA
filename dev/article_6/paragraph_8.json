In the following centuries, the few steam-powered \"engines\" known were, like the aeolipile, essentially experimental devices used by inventors to demonstrate the properties of steam. A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi al-Din in 1551 and by <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><a3_3><b8_0>Giovanni Branca<b8_0/><a3_3/><a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/> in 1629.

Denis Papin, a Huguenot refugee, did some useful work on the steam digester in 1679, and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690."}
