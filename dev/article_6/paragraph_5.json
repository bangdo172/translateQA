The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><b5_0>lengthening rubbing surfaces<a2_1/> of the valve<b5_0/><a2_2/><a2_0/> in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><b4_0>Joy<b4_0/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/> and Walschaerts motions. <a0_0><a0_2><b3_0>Corliss<b3_0/><a0_2/><a0_0/>, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms."}
