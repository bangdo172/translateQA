Savery's steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber, and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water. Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston, and was used in <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><a4_3><b9_0>1712<b9_0/><a4_3/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/> for pumping in a mine."}
