The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (<a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><b6_0>in the condenser<b6_0/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>) are isobaric (<a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><b7_0>constant pressure<b7_0/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>) processes in the Rankine cycle and <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><b8_0>isothermal<b8_0/><a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/> (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as <a4_1>a <a4_0><b9_0>liquid<b9_0/><a4_1/><a4_0/> not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in <a4_2>gaseous<a4_2/> form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages."}
