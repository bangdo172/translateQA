It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads <b9_0>guilty<b9_0/> is essentially stating, \"Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am <a2_2><a2_3>proud of it<a2_3/><a2_2/>. <a2_0><a2_1>I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law<a2_1/><a2_0/>; I am guilty as charged,\" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, \"<a3_0><a3_1><a3_3>Guilt implies wrong-doing<a3_3/><a3_1/><a3_0/>. I feel I have done no wrong. <a3_4><a3_5>I may <a2_4><a2_5>have violated some specific laws, but I am <a3_2>guilty of doing no w<a2_5/><a2_4/>rong<a3_5/><a3_4/><a3_2/>. I therefore plead <b6_0>not guilty<b6_0/>.\" A plea of <a4_1>no contest<a4_1/> is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, \"I plead for the beauty that surrounds us\"; this is known as a \"<a4_0><a4_2><a4_3><a4_4><a4_5>creative plea<a4_5/><a4_4/><a4_3/><a4_2/><a4_0/>,\" and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty."}
