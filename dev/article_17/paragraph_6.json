disputed by <a0_0><a0_2><a0_3><a0_4><a7_2>Thoreau<a7_2/><a0_3/><a0_2/><a0_0/>'s<a0_4/> political philosophy <b10_0>pitching the conscience vs. the collective<b10_0/>. <a5_0><a5_2><a5_3>The <a5_4>individual<a5_4/><a5_3/><a5_2/><a5_0/> is the final judge of <b11_0>right and wrong<b11_0/>. More than this, since only individuals act, only <a4_2><a4_4><a6_0><a6_3><a6_4>individuals<a6_4/><a6_3/><a6_0/><a4_4/><a4_2/> can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is <a6_2>an individual<a6_2/> in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before <b12_0>Thoreau<b12_0/>\u2019s <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><a1_3><a1_4>imprisonment<a1_4/><a1_3/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his <a3_1>refusal to pay<a3_1/>, <a0_1><a7_0><a7_1><a7_3>Thoreau<a7_3/><a7_1/><a7_0/><a0_1/> had advised, <b13_0>\u201c<a3_0><a3_2><a3_3><a3_4><a8_0><a8_1><a8_2><a8_3><a8_4>Resign<a8_4/><a8_3/><a8_2/><a8_1/><a8_0/><a3_4/><a3_3/><a3_2/><a3_0/>.\u201d<b13_0/> If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then <a7_4>Thoreau<a7_4/> insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. But if government is \u201cthe voice of the people,\u201d as it is often called, shouldn\u2019t that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express <b14_0>the will of the majority<b14_0/> but it may also express nothing more than <a2_2><a2_3>the will of <a4_0><a4_1><a4_3>elite politicians<a4_3/><a4_1/><a4_0/><a2_3/><a2_2/>. Even a good form of government is \u201cliable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.\u201d Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of <a5_1><a6_1>individuals<a6_1/><a5_1/> who disagree with what is being said. <a9_2><a9_3>The majority <a9_1><a9_4>may be powerful but it is <a2_0><a2_1><a2_4><a9_0>not necessarily right<a9_4/><a9_3/><a9_2/><a9_1/><a9_0/><a2_4/><a2_1/><a2_0/>. What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?"}
