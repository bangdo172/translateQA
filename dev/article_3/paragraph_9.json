The Sky Q range consists of three set top boxes (Sky Q, Sky Q Silver and Sky Q Mini), a broadband router (<a0_0><a0_1><a0_2><b5_0>Sky Q Hub<b5_0/><a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/>) and mobile applications. The Sky Q set top boxes introduce a new user interface, Wi-Fi hotspot functionality, Power-line and Bluetooth connectivity and a new touch-sensitive remote control. The Sky Q Mini set top boxes connect to <a1_1>the <a1_0><a1_2><b6_0>Sky Q Silver<a1_2/> set top boxes<b6_0/><a1_1/><a1_0/> with a Wi-Fi or Power-line connection rather than receive their own satellite feeds.
