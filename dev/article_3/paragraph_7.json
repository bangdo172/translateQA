Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted (whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode, without a subscription card) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package. Within two months of the launch, BSkyB gained <b7_0>400,000<b7_0/> new subscribers, with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well, which helped BSkyB reach <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>3.5 million<a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/> households by mid-1994. <b8_0>Michael Grade<b8_0/> criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage, mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels."}
