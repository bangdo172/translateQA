The pattern of the Vistula terraces is asymmetrical. The left side consist mainly of two levels: the highest one contains <a1_0><a1_1><b9_0>former flooded terraces<b9_0/><a1_1/><a1_0/> and the lowest one the flood plain terrace. The contemporary flooded terrace still has visible <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><b6_0>valleys<b6_0/><a2_2/><a2_0/> and ground depressions<a2_1/> with water systems coming from the Vistula old \u2013 riverbed. They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches. The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms. There are several levels of the <a3_0><b7_0>plain Vistula terraces<b7_0/><a3_0/> (flooded as well as former flooded once) and only small part and not so visible moraine escarpment.
