A city is also <b3_0>a commune<b3_0/> \u2013 but with the <b6_0>city charter.<b6_0/> Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor \u2013 but in the communes the mayor is vogt (w\u00f3jt in Polish), however in the cities \u2013 burmistrz. Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division \u2013 <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><b4_0>counties or powiats<b4_0/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>. An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e. a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered, not gmina). In this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki. Such cities are for example Lublin, Krak\u00f3w, Gda\u0144sk, Pozna\u0144. In <b7_0>Warsaw<b7_0/>, its districts additionally have some of powiat's entitlements \u2013 like already mentioned car registration. For example, the district Wola has its own evidence and the district Ursyn\u00f3w \u2013 its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from Ursyn\u00f3w). But for instance the districts in <a2_0><a2_1><b5_0>Krak\u00f3w<b5_0/><a2_1/><a2_0/> do not have entitlements of powiat, so the registration numbers in Krak\u00f3w are of the same type for all districts."}
