Galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an \"absolute rest frame\" did not exist. <a2_0><b8_0>Galileo<b8_0/><a2_0/> concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><a1_3><a1_4>rest<a1_4/><a1_3/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>. This was contrary to <a2_1><a2_2><a2_3><a2_4>Aristotle<a2_3/><a2_2/>'s<a2_4/><a2_1/> notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall <a3_1>straight down<a3_1/> while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an <b7_0>Aristotelian<b7_0/> universe, the falling cannonball would land <a3_0><a3_2><a3_3><a3_4>behind the foot of the mast<a3_3/><a3_2/><a3_0/> of a moving ship<a3_4/>. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls <a4_2><a4_3><a4_4>at <a4_1>the <a4_0>foot of the mast<a4_4/><a4_3/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/>, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity."}
