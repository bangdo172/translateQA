In GR, <b5_0><b7_0>gravitation<b7_0/><b5_0/> is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in <a1_2>straight lines<a1_2/> through curved space-time \u2013 defined as <a1_3>the shortest space-time <a1_1>path between two space-time events<a1_1/>.<a1_3/> From <a3_3>the perspective of the object<a3_3/>, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in <a3_1>a <a3_0>global<a3_0/> sense<a3_1/> that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the <b6_0>straight<b6_0/> line path in space-time is seen as a curved line <a3_2>in space<a3_2/>, and it is called the <a1_0>ballistic trajectory<a1_0/> of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as \"<a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><a2_3>gravitational force<a2_3/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>\"."}
