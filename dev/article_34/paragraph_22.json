For example, <a0_0><a0_1><a0_2><a0_3><b5_0>Isaac Newton<b5_0/><a0_3/><a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/> unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation. <b6_0>Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell<b6_0/> demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. In <a1_1>the <a1_0><a1_2><a1_3>20th<a1_3/><a1_2/><a1_0/> century<a1_1/>, the development of quantum mechanics led to <b7_0>a modern understanding<b7_0/> that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics.

Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.:212\u2013219"}
