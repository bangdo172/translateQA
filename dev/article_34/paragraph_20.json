With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity, it was realized that <a1_0><a1_2>force<a1_2/><a1_0/> is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum (<a1_1>4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics<a1_1/>). The <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><b5_0><b6_0>conservation of momentum<b6_0/><b5_0/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force. Thus <a2_3>the <b7_0>currently known fundamental forces<b7_0/><a2_3/> are considered more accurately to be \"fundamental interactions\".:199\u2013128 When particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle B, a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A' exchanging by B. This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>Feynman<a3_2/><a3_0/> diagrams<a3_1/>. In a <b8_0>Feynman<b8_0/> diagram, each matter particle is represented as a <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><a4_3>straight<a4_3/><a4_2/><a4_0/> line<a4_1/> (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines. Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and, in the case of virtual particle exchange, are absorbed at an adjacent vertex."}
