This led <a4_0><a4_2><a4_3>Maxwell<a4_3/><a4_2/><a4_0/> to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be \"self-generating\" through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light. This insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic spectrum."}
