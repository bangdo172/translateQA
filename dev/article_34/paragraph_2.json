He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for <a3_2>heavy bodies to fall<a3_2/>), which led to \"<a4_2>natural motion<a4_2/>\", and <a4_0><a4_1><a4_3><a4_5>unnatural<a4_5/><a4_3/><a4_1/><a4_0/> or forced motion, which required <a4_4>continued application of a force<a4_4/>. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. <b8_0>Aristotle<b8_0/> was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general."}
