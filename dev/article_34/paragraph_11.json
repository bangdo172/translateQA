Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as <a0_3>\"<a0_0><a0_1><a0_2>vector quantities<a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/>\"<a0_3/>. This means that <b7_0><b8_0>forces<b8_0/><b7_0/> follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (<a1_0><a1_2>denoted <a1_1><a1_3><a1_4>scalar quantities<a1_4/><a1_3/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to <a2_4>know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result<a2_4/>.

For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, <a4_4>it is impossible<a4_4/> to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without <a4_3>knowing the direction of the forces<a4_3/> it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of <a4_2>adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other<a4_2/>. <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><a2_3><a4_0><a4_1>Associating forces with vectors<a4_1/><a4_0/><a2_3/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> avoids such problems."}
