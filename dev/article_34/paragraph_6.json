This is why, for example, astronauts experience <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><a3_3><a3_4><b8_0>weightlessness<b8_0/><a3_4/><a3_3/><a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/> when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments. If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia. This is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame.
