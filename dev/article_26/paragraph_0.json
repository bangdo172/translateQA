It was first established in 1988 by two United Nations organizations, <a1_0><a1_2>the <a1_1><b6_0>World Meteorological Organization (WMO)<b6_0/> and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)<a1_2/><a1_0/>,<a1_1/> and later endorsed by the <b7_0>United Nations General Assembly<b7_0/> through <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>Resolution 43/53<a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/>. Membership of the IPCC is open to all members of the <b8_0>WMO<b8_0/> and UNEP. The IPCC produces reports that support <a3_2><b9_0>the <a3_0><a3_1>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change<a3_0/> (UNFCCC)<b9_0/><a3_1/>,<a3_2/> which is the main international treaty on climate change. The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to \"<a2_2>stabilize <a2_0><a2_1>greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere<a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [i.e., human-induced] interference with the climate system\". IPCC reports cover \"the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.\""}
