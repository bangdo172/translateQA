This <a1_4>internal<a1_4/> form is distinct from <b7_0>informal U.S. imperialism<b7_0/> in the form of political and financial hegemony. This internal form of imperialism is also distinct from the United States' formation of \"colonies\" abroad. Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion, the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism. This internal form of empire has been referred to as <a1_0>\"<a1_1><a1_2><a1_3><b5_0>internal colonialism<b5_0/><a1_3/><a1_2/><a1_1/>\"<a1_0/>.

However, this internal colonialism faced resistance, as external colonialism did, but the anti-colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the United States was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and African-Americans. In his lecture on April 16, 2003, Edward Said made a bold statement on modern imperialism in the United States, whom he described as using aggressive means of attack towards <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>the <a3_3><a3_4>contemporary Orient<a3_3/><a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>, \"<a3_4/>due to their backward living, lack of democracy and the violation of women\u2019s rights. The western world forgets during this process of converting the other that enlightenment and democracy are concepts that not all will agree upon\"."}
