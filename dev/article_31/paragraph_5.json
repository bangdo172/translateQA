Although <b5_0>imperialism and colonialism<b5_0/> focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to <a1_2>the process of a <a1_4>country <a1_0><b6_0>taking physical control of another<b6_0/><a1_4/><a1_2/><a1_0/>, imperialism refers to the <a2_3>political and monetary dominance<a2_3/>, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start <a1_3>dominating areas<a1_3/> and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins <a1_1>a conquest over an area<a1_1/> and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is <a4_1><a4_2>the <a4_0><a4_3><a4_4><b9_0>exploitation<b9_0/><a4_0/> of the valuable assets and supplies<a4_1/> of the nation that was conquered<a4_4/><a4_2/> and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits<a4_3/> from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, <a2_2>by <a2_0><a2_1><b7_0>conquering the other state's lands<b7_0/><a2_2/><a2_0/> and therefore increasing its own dominance<a2_1/>. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that <a3_3>the <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><a3_4><b8_0>characteristics<b8_0/><a3_4/><a3_0/> of the conquering peoples<a3_3/><a3_2/><a3_1/> are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations."}
