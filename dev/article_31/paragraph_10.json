This imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the East. Rather, by essentializing the East, this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to create difference and distance between \"we\" the West and \"<a1_1>them<a1_1/>\" the East, or \"here\" in the West and \"there\" in the East. This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East <a1_2>as <a1_0><a1_3><a1_4><a2_1><a2_3><b6_0>irrational and backward<b6_0/><a2_3/><a2_1/><a1_4/><a1_3/><a1_2/><a1_0/> in opposition to the <a4_1><a4_2><a4_3>rational and <a4_0><b9_0>progressive<b9_0/><a4_3/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/> West. <a3_2>Defining the East as a negative vision of itself<a3_2/>, as <a2_2>its <a2_0><a2_4><a3_1><b7_0>inferior<b7_0/><a3_1/><a2_4/><a2_2/><a2_0/>, not only increased the West\u2019s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled. The discourse of <a3_0><a3_3><a3_4><b8_0>Orientalism<b8_0/><a3_4/><a3_3/><a3_0/> therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories."}
