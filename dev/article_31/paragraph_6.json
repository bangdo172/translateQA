J. A. Hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as: \"It is desirable that the earth should be peopled, governed, and developed, as far as possible, by the races which can do this work best, i.e. by <a1_2>the <a1_4>races <a1_3>of <a1_0><a1_1><b6_0>highest 'social efficiency<a1_3/>'<a1_1/><a1_0/>\"<b6_0/><a1_4/><a1_2/>. Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><a2_3><a2_4><b7_0>imperialism<b7_0/><a2_4/><a2_3/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> was needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of \"<a3_1><a3_2><a3_3>Social Darwinism<a3_3/><a3_2/><a3_1/>\" and a <a3_0><b8_0>theory of races<b8_0/><a3_0/> formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism. The rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose, for example throughout Latin America \"<a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><a4_3><a4_4><b9_0>whiteness<b9_0/><a4_4/><a4_3/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/>\" is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento (whitening) are common."}
