Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and <b8_0>many concepts<b8_0/> exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><a1_3><b5_0>ramification<a1_2/><a1_1/> in geometry<b5_0/><a1_3/><a1_0/>. Such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in <a2_3>the <a2_0><b6_0>ring of <a2_1><a2_2>integers of quadratic number fields<b6_0/><a2_3/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns <a3_0><a3_3><b7_0>the <a3_1><a3_2>solvability of quadratic equations"}
