Generally, \"prime\" indicates <a0_1><a0_2><a0_3>minimality<a0_1/> or <a0_0><b5_0>indecomposability<b5_0/><a0_3/><a0_2/><a0_0/>, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is <a1_0><a1_1><a1_3><b6_0>the smallest subfield<b6_0/><a1_3/><a1_1/><a1_0/> of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either <a1_2>Q or the finite field with p elements<a1_2/>, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><a4_3><b9_0>any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components<b9_0/><a4_3/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/>. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that <a2_0><a2_3><b7_0>it <a2_1><a2_2>cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots<b7_0/><a2_3/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>. Any knot can be uniquely expressed <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><a3_3><b8_0>as a connected sum of prime knots<b8_0/><a3_3/><a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>. Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type."}
