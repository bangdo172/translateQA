The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.[clarification needed] From a physical viewpoint, it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><a2_3><b7_0>random noise<b7_0/><a2_3/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>. From a mathematical viewpoint, it roughly states that the <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><a3_3><a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><a4_3><b8_0><b9_0>asymptotic<a4_1/><a3_1/> distribution<b9_0/><b8_0/><a4_3/><a4_2/><a4_0/><a3_3/><a3_2/><a3_0/> of primes (about x/log x of numbers less than x are primes, the prime number theorem) also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x (for intervals near x). This hypothesis is generally believed to be correct. In particular, the simplest assumption is that primes should have no significant irregularities without good reason."}
