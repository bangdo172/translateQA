In the historiography of Mongolia, it is generally considered to be the <a4_1>continuation of the Mongol Empire<a4_1/>. Mongols are widely known to worship <a1_0><a1_2>the <a1_1><b6_0>Eternal Heaven<b6_0/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>, and according to the traditional Mongolian ideology Yuan is considered to be \"the beginning of an infinite number of beings, the foundation of peace and happiness, state power, the dream of many peoples, besides it there is nothing great or precious.\" In traditional historiography of China, on the other hand, the Yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between <a2_2>the <a2_0><a2_1><b7_0>Song<b7_0/><a2_0/> dynasty<a2_2/><a2_1/> and <a3_2>the <a3_0><a3_1>Ming<a3_0/> dynasty<a3_2/><a3_1/>. Note, however, Yuan dynasty is traditionally often extended to cover the Mongol Empire before Kublai Khan's formal establishment of the Yuan in 1271, partly because Kublai had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or Taizu (Chinese: \u592a\u7956). Despite the traditional historiography as well as the official views (including the government of the <b8_0>Ming<b8_0/> dynasty which overthrew the Yuan dynasty), there also exist Chinese people[who?] who did not consider the Yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of China, but rather as <a4_0><a4_2>a period of foreign domination<a4_2/><a4_0/>. The latter believe that Han Chinese were treated as second-class citizens,[citation needed] and that China stagnated economically and scientifically."}
