Zhu used a method of elimination to reduce the simultaneous equations to a single equation with only one unknown. His method is described in the Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns, written in <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><b9_0>1303<b9_0/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/>. The opening pages contain a diagram of Pascal's triangle. The summation of a finite arithmetic series is also covered in the book."}
