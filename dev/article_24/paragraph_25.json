Among Kublai Khan's top engineers and scientists was the astronomer <a0_0><a0_1><a0_2><b5_0>Guo Shoujing<b5_0/><a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/>, who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the Yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of <a1_1><a1_2>365.2425 days of the year<a1_2/><a1_1/>, which was only <a1_0><b6_0>26 seconds off the modern Gregorian<b6_0/> calendar<a1_0/>'s measurement. Road and water communications were reorganized and improved. To provide against possible famines, <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><b7_0>granaries were ordered built<a2_2/> throughout the empire<b7_0/><a2_1/><a2_0/>. The city of <b8_0>Beijing<b8_0/> was rebuilt with new palace grounds that included artificial lakes, hills and mountains, and parks. During the Yuan period, <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>Beijing<a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/> became the terminus of the Grand Canal of China, which was completely renovated. These commercially oriented improvements encouraged overland and maritime commerce throughout Asia and facilitated direct Chinese contacts with Europe. Chinese travelers to the West were able to provide assistance in such areas as hydraulic engineering. Contacts with the West also brought the introduction to China of a major food crop, <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><b9_0>sorghum<b9_0/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/>, along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation."}
