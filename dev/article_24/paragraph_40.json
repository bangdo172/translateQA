Nevertheless, socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties. Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (<a2_1><a2_2>various <a2_0><b7_0>allied groups<a2_2/> from Central Asia<b7_0/> and the western end of the empire<a2_1/><a2_0/>) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a <a3_1>somewhat strong \"<a3_0><a3_2><b8_0>colonial<b8_0/><a3_2/><a3_0/>\" coloration<a3_1/>. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century. In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners <a4_2>reaching the highest-post in the government<a4_2/> compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the <a4_0><a4_1>Ilkhanate<a4_1/><a4_0/>. Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty. In response to an objection against the use of \"barbarians\" in his government, the Yongle Emperor answered: \"... Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, who employed only \"Mongols and Tartars\" and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them\"."}
