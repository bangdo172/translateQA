The counterpart in Mongolian language was <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><b7_0>Dai \u00d6n Ulus<b7_0/><a2_2/><a2_1/>, also rendered as Ikh Yuan \u00dcls or Yekhe Yuan Ulus<a2_0/>. In Mongolian, Dai \u00d6n (Great Yuan) is often used in conjunction with the \"Yeke Mongghul Ulus\" (lit. \"<a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>Great Mongol State<a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>\"), resulting in Dai \u00d6n Yeke Mongghul Ulus (Mongolian script: ), meaning \"Great Yuan <b8_0>Great Mongol State<b8_0/>\". The Yuan dynasty is also known as the \"Mongol dynasty\" or \"Mongol Dynasty of China\", similar to the names \"Manchu dynasty\" or \"Manchu Dynasty of China\" for the Qing dynasty. Furthermore, the Yuan is sometimes known as the \"Empire of the Great Khan\" or \"Khanate of the Great Khan\", which particularly appeared on some Yuan maps, since Yuan emperors held the nominal title of <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><b9_0>Great Khan<b9_0/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/>. Nevertheless, both terms can also refer to the khanate within the Mongol Empire directly ruled by Great Khans before the actual establishment of the Yuan dynasty by Kublai Khan in 1271."}
