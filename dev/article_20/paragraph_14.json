As of September 2011[update], it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession. It was worth <a0_0><a0_1><a0_2>$32 billion<a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/> in 2011, up from $28 billion in September 2010 and $26 billion in 2009. It suffered about <a1_0><a1_2><b7_0>30%<b7_0/> loss<a1_2/><a1_0/> in 2008-09. In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately <b5_0>$8 billion<b5_0/>) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of <a1_1><b6_0>$12 billion<b6_0/><a1_1/>. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of <a2_2>construction of the $1.2 billion <a2_0><a2_1><b8_0>Allston Science Complex<b8_0/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in <b9_0>protests<b9_0/> from local residents.
