While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won <b4_0>the Rose Bowl<b4_0/> in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2>1903<a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>, <b5_0>Harvard Stadium<b5_0/> introduced a new era into football with <b6_0>the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country<b6_0/>. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (<a3_0>former <b7_0>captain<b7_0/> of the <a3_1><a3_2>Yale<a3_2/><a3_1/> football team<a3_0/>), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2>1906<a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> season. These included legalizing <b8_0>the forward pass<b8_0/>, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history."}
