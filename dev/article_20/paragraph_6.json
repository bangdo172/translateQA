Agassiz's approach was <b4_0>distinctly idealist<b4_0/> and posited Americans' \"participation in the Divine Nature\" and the possibility of understanding \"intellectual existences\".

When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to <b7_0>matters of shape based on a presumed archetype<b7_0/> for his evidence.

The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \"soar with Plato\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norrisand, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the \"official philosophy\" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school."}
