The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871; however, Jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area. The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from <a0_0><a0_1><a0_2><b5_0><b7_0>Hurricane Dora<b7_0/><b5_0/><a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/> in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds. The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><b6_0>110 mph<b6_0/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/> (180 km/h), making it a strong Category 2 on the <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>Saffir-Simpson<a3_1/> Scale<a3_2/><a3_0/>. Jacksonville also suffered damage from <a4_0><a4_2>2008<a4_2/><a4_0/>'s Tropical Storm <a4_1>Fay<a4_1/> which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days. Similarly, four years prior to this, Jacksonville was inundated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which made landfall south of the area. These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach. During Floyd, the <b8_0>Jacksonville Beach pier<b8_0/> was severely damaged, and later demolished. The rebuilt pier was later damaged by Fay, but not destroyed. Tropical Storm Bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004, spawning a minor <b9_0>tornado<b9_0/> in the process. On May 28, 2012, Jacksonville was hit by <a2_0><a2_2>Tropical Storm <a2_1>Beryl<a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>, packing winds up to 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach."}
