This caused <a2_0><a2_2>increased flooding and sedimentation<a2_2/><a2_0/>, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta.

Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><b9_0>11\u201313th century<a4_0/> AD<b9_0/><a4_2/><a4_1/>. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were short cut and groynes were built, to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up."}
