The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision, in general, caused much resentment in Germany and is often cited as <a3_1>helping <a3_0><a3_2>Adolf Hitler's rise to power<a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>. The allies left the Rhineland, in <a1_1>1930<a1_1/> and the German army re-occupied it in <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><b8_0>1936<b8_0/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/>, which was enormously popular in Germany. Although the allies could probably have prevented the re-occupation, Britain and France were not inclined to do so, a feature of their policy of appeasement to Hitler."}
