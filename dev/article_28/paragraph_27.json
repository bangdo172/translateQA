During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel. This caused the Rhine's course to be diverted through the English Channel.

During interglacials, when sea level rose to approximately the present level, the Rhine built deltas, in what is now the Netherlands."}
