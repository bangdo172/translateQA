The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river <a2_1>Epte<a2_1/> and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against <b6_0>further Viking incursions.<b6_0/> The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river <a2_0><a2_2>Seine<a2_2/><a2_0/>, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis)."}
