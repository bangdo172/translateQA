Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross-sectional data. However, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be <a6_0><a6_1><a6_2>very weak<a6_2/><a6_1/><a6_0/>. Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will <a7_0><a7_1>eventually <a7_2>decrease<a7_2/><a7_1/><a7_0/> given time. As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from <a0_0><a0_1><a0_2><b9_0>1910 to 1940<b9_0/><a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/> and thereafter.[citation needed] However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><b10_0>1970s<b10_0/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>. This does not necessarily disprove <b13_0>Kuznets<b13_0/>' theory.[citation needed] It may be possible that another Kuznets' cycle is occurring, specifically the move from the <a3_0><a3_1><b12_0>manufacturing<b12_0/><a3_1/><a3_0/> sector to the <a2_0><a2_1><b11_0>service<b11_0/><a2_1/><a2_0/> sector.[citation needed] This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be <a8_1>in <a8_0><a8_2>effect<a8_2/><a8_1/><a8_0/> at any given time."}
