Lagerlof and Galor stated that <a9_0>gender inequality in <a3_2>education<a9_0/><a3_2/> can result to <a9_1>low economic growth<a9_1/>, and <a9_2>continued <a3_0><a3_1><b13_0>gender inequality in education<b13_0/><a9_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>, thus creating a poverty trap. It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth, which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries."}
