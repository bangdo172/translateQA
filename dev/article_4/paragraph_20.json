The first European settlement in the area later known as Victoria was established in October 1803 under Lieutenant-Governor David Collins at Sullivan Bay on Port Phillip. It consisted of 402 people (5 Government officials, 9 officers of marines, 2 drummers, and 39 privates, 5 soldiers' wives, and a child, 307 convicts, 17 convicts' wives, and 7 children). They had been sent from England in HMS Calcutta under the command of <b7_0>Captain Daniel Woodriff<b7_0/>, principally out of fear that the French, who had been exploring the area, might establish their own settlement and thereby challenge British rights to the continent."}
