The Treaties establish the EU's institutions, list their powers and responsibilities, and explain the areas in which the EU can legislate with Directives or Regulations. <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><a1_3>The <b7_0>European Commission<b7_0/><a1_3/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/> has the initiative to propose legislation. During the ordinary legislative procedure, the Council (which are ministers from member state governments) and the European Parliament (elected by <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><a2_3>citizens<a2_3/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>) can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass.

The Court can review the legality of the EU institutions' actions, in compliance with the Treaties. It can also decide upon claims for breach of EU laws from member states and <b8_0>citizens<b8_0/>."}
