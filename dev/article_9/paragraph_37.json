With countries such as Spain not even having a crime against <a1_0><a1_1><b5_0>shipping toxic waste<b5_0/><a1_1/><a1_0/>, Franco Frattini, the Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner, proposed with Dimas to create <b6_0>criminal sentences for \"ecological crimes\"<b6_0/>. The competence for the Union to do this was contested in <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>2005<a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/> at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission. That ruling set a precedent that the Commission, on a supranational basis, may legislate in criminal law \u2013 something never done before. So far, the only other proposal has been the draft intellectual property rights directive. Motions were tabled in the European Parliament against that legislation on the basis that criminal law should not be an EU competence, but was rejected at vote. However, in <a2_0><b7_0>October <a2_1><a2_2>2007<b7_0/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>, the Court of Justice ruled that the Commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be, only that there must be some."}
