In <a0_0><a0_1><a0_2>Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen<a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/> it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2>a postal company<a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>, claimed that what is now <a1_1><a1_2>TFEU article 30<a1_2/><a1_1/> prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\". Because <a1_0>article 30<a1_0/> clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, <b5_0>Van Gend en Loos<b5_0/> could recover the money it paid for the tariff. <a3_1>EU Regulations are the same as <a3_0>Treaty provisions<a3_0/> in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, <a3_2><b6_0>they are \u2018directly applicable in all Member States<b6_0/>\u2019<a3_2/><a3_1/>. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. \"Regulations,\" held the Court of Justice, \"come into force solely by virtue of their publication\" and implementation could have the effect of \"jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union.\" On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed."}
