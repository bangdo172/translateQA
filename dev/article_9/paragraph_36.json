In Gebhard v Consiglio dell\u2019Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be \"established\" means to <a1_2>participate in economic life \"on a stable and continuous basis\"<a1_2/>, while providing \"services\" meant pursuing activity more \"on a temporary basis\". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed <a1_0><a1_1>if they were non-discriminatory<a1_0/>, \"justified by imperative requirements in the general interest\" and proportionately applied<a1_1/>. <b7_0>All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or \"undertakings\" such as companies or firms<b7_0/>, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that <b8_0>both a member state government and a private party<b8_0/> can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" direct effect. In <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2>Reyners v Belgium<a2_2/><a2_0/> the Court of Justice<a2_1/> held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. <a3_1>TFEU <a3_0><a3_2>article 49<a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/> says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise \"official authority\", but this did an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>Commission v Italy<a4_2/><a4_0/> the Court of Justice<a4_1/> held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven <b9_0>that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market<b9_0/>. Therefore, there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified."}
