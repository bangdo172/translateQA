The <b10_0>heads of government of member states<b10_0/> also convene a \"<b12_0>European Council<b12_0/>\" (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities'. It meets <a6_0><a6_1><a6_2><a6_3>each six months<a6_3/><a6_2/><a6_1/><a6_0/> and its President (currently former <a1_1>Poland Prime Minister <a1_0><a1_2><a1_3><b11_0>Donald Tusk<b11_0/><a1_3/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions. When voting takes place <a2_1><a2_2>it is <a2_3>weighted <a2_0><b13_0>inversely<b13_0/><a2_0/> to member state size<a2_3/><a2_2/><a2_1/>, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states. In total there are <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><a3_3><a7_0><a7_1>352<a7_1/><a7_0/><a3_3/><a3_2/><a3_0/> votes<a3_1/>, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus. TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define this to mean <a8_0>at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU<a8_0/>: currently this means around <a8_1><a8_2><a8_3>74 per cent, or <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><a4_3>260<a4_3/><a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/> of the <a7_2><a7_3>352<a7_3/><a7_2/> votes<a8_3/><a8_2/><a8_1/>. This is critical during the legislative process."}
