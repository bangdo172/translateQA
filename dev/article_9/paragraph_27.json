The agreement aimed <b6_0>to prevent Germany from re-establishing <b7_0>dominance in the production of coal and steel<b7_0/><b6_0/> as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war.

This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>1957<a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/> competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid. Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time."}
