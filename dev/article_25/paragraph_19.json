On the other hand, the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors. For example, large numbers of <b8_0>human <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>V\u03b39/V\u03b42<a4_1/> T cells<b8_0/><a4_2/><a4_0/> respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted V\u03b41+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells."}
