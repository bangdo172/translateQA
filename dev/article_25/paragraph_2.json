It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of <a3_0>Athens in <a3_1><a3_2><b5_0>430 BC<b5_0/><a3_1/><a3_0/>.<a3_2/> Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, <b6_0>Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis<b6_0/> made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by <b7_0>Louis Pasteur<b7_0/> in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until <a0_0><a0_1><a0_2>Robert Koch<a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/>'s 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2>microorganisms<a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/> were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in <b8_0>1901<b8_0/>, with the discovery of the <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2>yellow fever<a2_1/> virus<a2_2/><a2_0/> by Walter Reed."}
