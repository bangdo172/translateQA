The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell's <a0_0><a0_1><a0_2>CD4<a0_1/> co-receptor<a0_2/><a0_0/>, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) that are responsible for the T cell's activation. <b6_0>Helper T cells<b6_0/> have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (<a1_0><a1_1><a1_2>around 200\u2013300<a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by <b7_0>engagement of <a2_0><a2_2>a <a2_1>single<a2_1/> MHC:antigen molecule<b7_0/><a2_2/><a2_0/>. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell.

Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>CD40<a4_1/> ligand<a4_2/><a4_0/> (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate <b9_0>antibody<b9_0/>-producing B cells."}
