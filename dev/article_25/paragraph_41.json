They are divided into <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2>four<a1_1/> classes<a1_2/> (Type I \u2013 IV)<a1_0/> based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2>Type I<a2_1/><a2_0/> hypersensitivity<a2_2/> is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from <b7_0>mild discomfort<b7_0/> to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>IgE<a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2><b9_0>Type II<a4_1/> hypersensitivity<b9_0/><a4_2/><a4_0/> occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. <b8_0>Type IV<b8_0/> hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages."}
