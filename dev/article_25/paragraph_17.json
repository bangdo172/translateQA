As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><b7_0>T cell receptor<a1_1/> (TCR)<a1_2/><a1_0/> binds to this specific antigen<b7_0/> in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><b8_0>CD8<b8_0/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>perforin<a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>, which form <b9_0>pores<b9_0/> in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>granulysin<a4_1/><a4_0/> (a protease)<a4_2/> induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T cells (see below)."}
