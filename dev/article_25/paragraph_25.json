Conversely, some <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2>hormones<a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> are regulated by the immune system, notably <b6_0>thyroid hormone<b6_0/> activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, <b7_0>they stay indoors more<b7_0/> due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>cholecalciferol<a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/> via UVB radiation.
