On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a <b7_0>theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction<b7_0/>: \"self\" constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while \"nonself\" entities (<a1_0><a1_1><a1_2>pathogens, an allograft<a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>) trigger a destructive immune response.

The <b6_0>self/nonself theory<b6_0/> of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, but remain very influential."}
