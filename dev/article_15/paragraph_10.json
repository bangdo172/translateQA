Because <b10_0>rock<b10_0/> units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: <b6_0>through faulting and folding<b6_0/>. <a1_0>In the <a1_1><a1_2>shallow crust<a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>, where brittle deformation can occur, <b8_0>thrust faults form<b8_0/>, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by <b11_0>the principle of superposition<b11_0/>, <b7_0>this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones<b7_0/>. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, <b12_0>rocks behave plastically<b12_0/>, and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those <b9_0>where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"<a2_0><a2_1><a2_2>antiforms<a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"<a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><b14_0>synforms<b14_0/><a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>\"<b9_0/>. If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called <a4_0><a4_2>anticlines and synclines<a4_2/><a4_0/>, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an <a4_1>overturned anticline<a4_1/> or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms."}
