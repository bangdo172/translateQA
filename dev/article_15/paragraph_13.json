The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of <a0_0><a0_1><a0_2>layered <b13_0>basaltic lava flows<b13_0/><a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/>. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain <b5_0>almost-<b12_0>undeformed stacks of <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2>sedimentary<a2_2/><a2_1/> rocks<b12_0/><b5_0/><a2_0/> that have remained in place <b11_0>since <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>Cambrian time<b11_0/><a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks <b6_0>have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded<b6_0/>. Even older rocks, such as <b9_0>the <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><b10_0>Acasta gneiss<b10_0/><a1_1/><a1_0/> of the <a4_0>Slave craton<b9_0/> in <a4_2>northwestern <a4_1>Canada<a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/><a1_2/>, the oldest known rock in the world <b7_0>have been metamorphosed<b7_0/> to the point where <b8_0>their origin<b8_0/> is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, <b14_0>the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed<b14_0/>, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area."}
