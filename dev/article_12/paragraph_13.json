The section of <a0_0><a0_1><a0_2>Huntington Boulevard<a0_2/><a0_1/><a0_0/> between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes. The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field. The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2><b5_0>William Stranahan<b5_0/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/> for the <b6_0>Pacific Improvement Corporation<b6_0/>, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><b9_0>1914<b9_0/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><b7_0>267<b7_0/><a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/> homes. This rapid development was no doubt hastened by <b8_0>the <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>Fresno Traction Company<a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/> right-of-way<b8_0/> along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital."}
