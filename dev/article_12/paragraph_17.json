He bequeathed <b7_0>a major portion of his estate<b7_0/> in <b5_0>1968<b5_0/> to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in Northeast Fresno. The park lies on the South bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road. The initial <b6_0>235 acres<b6_0/> (0.95 km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the City, brings the park to a sizable <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2>300<a1_2/><a1_1/> acres<a1_0/> (1.2 km2). Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing. The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2><b8_0>2,500<b8_0/><a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S.

The park's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life.
