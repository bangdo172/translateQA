It is said that they landed on the coastline peninsula of Davenports Neck called <a1_0>\"<a1_1><a1_2>Bauffet's Point<a1_2/><a1_1/>\"<a1_0/> after traveling from England where they had previously taken refuge on account of religious persecution, four years before the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. They purchased from <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2>John Pell<a2_2/><a2_1/>, Lord of Pelham Manor<a2_0/>, a tract of land consisting of <b6_0>six thousand one hundred acres<b6_0/> with the help of <b7_0>Jacob Leisler<b7_0/>. It was named New Rochelle after <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>La Rochelle<a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/>, their former strong-hold in France. A small wooden church was first erected in the community, followed by a second church that built of stone. Previous to the erection of it, the strong men would often walk <b8_0>twenty-three miles<b8_0/> on Saturday evening, the distance by the road from New Rochelle to New York, to attend the Sunday service. The church was eventually replaced by a third, <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church<a4_2/><a4_1/><a4_0/>, which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church \"<b9_0>Eglise du St. Esperit<b9_0/>\" on Pine Street in New York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room. The Huguenot cemetery, or \"Huguenot Burial Ground\", has since been recognized as a historic cemetery that is the final resting place for a wide range of the Huguenot founders, early settlers and prominent citizens dating back more than three centuries."}
