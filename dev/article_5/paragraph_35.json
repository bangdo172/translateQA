The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of <b5_0>France<b5_0/> could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2>University of <b6_0>Paris<b6_0/><a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>, published his French translation of the New Testament in <a2_1><b7_0>1523<b7_0/><a2_1/>, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in <a2_0><a2_2><b8_0>1530<b8_0/><a2_2/><a2_0/>. <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>William Farel<a3_2/><a3_1/><a3_0/> was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>Jean Cauvin<a4_2/><a4_1/> (John Calvin)<a4_0/>, another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join <b9_0>William Farel<b9_0/>, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence. Sometime between 1550 and 1580, members of the Reformed church in France came to be commonly known as Huguenots.[citation needed]"}
