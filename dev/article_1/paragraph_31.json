A problem X is hard for a class of problems C <a1_0><b5_0>if every problem in C can be reduced to X<b5_0/><a1_0/>. Thus <b6_0>no <a1_1>problem<b6_0/> in C is harder than X<a1_1/>, since an algorithm for X allows us to <a2_0><a2_1><a2_2>solve any problem in C<a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on <a0_0><a0_1><b4_0>the type of reduction being used<a0_1/><a0_0/>.<b4_0/> For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2><b7_0>NP-hard<b7_0/><a3_1/><a3_0/> problems<a3_2/>."}
