It is believed that if a problem can be solved by <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2>an algorithm<a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/>, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church\u2013Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, <a2_0><a2_1>the <a2_2>Turing machine<a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/> is the most commonly used model in complexity theory."}
