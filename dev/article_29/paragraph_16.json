MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties. Errant members can be <a3_0><a3_1><a3_2>deselected as official party candidates<a3_1/> during future elections<a3_2/><a3_0/>, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright.

In some circumstances, however, parties announce \"free votes\", which allows Members to vote as they please. This is typically done on <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>moral<a4_1/><a4_0/> issues<a4_2/>."}
