The rows are oriented to run from near the mouth (the \"oral pole\") to the opposite end (the \"aboral pole\"), and are spaced more or less evenly around the body, although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth. The \"combs\" (<a1_0>also called <a1_1>\"<a1_2>ctenes<a1_2/>\" or \"comb plates<a1_0/>\"<a1_1/>) run across each row, and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia, <b7_0>up to <a4_0><a4_1><a4_2>2 millimeters<b7_0/><a4_2/><a4_1/> (0.079 in)<a4_0/>. Unlike conventional cilia and flagella, which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern, these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern, where the extra compact filament is <a2_1>suspected to have <a2_2>a <a2_0>supporting function<a2_2/><a2_1/><a2_0/>. These normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth, although they can also reverse direction. Hence ctenophores usually swim <a3_0><b8_0>in <a3_1>the <a3_2>direction in which the mouth is pointing<b8_0/><a3_2/><a3_1/>,<a3_0/> unlike jellyfish. When trying to escape predators, one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed; some other species reverse direction as part of their <b9_0>escape<b9_0/> behavior, by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia."}
