It has been the focus of <b6_0>debate<b6_0/> for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the <a0_1>Bilateria<a0_1/>, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and <a0_2>Bilateria<a0_2/>, and sister to all other animal phyla. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to <a0_0>all other animals<a0_0/>. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved <b3_0>independently<b3_0/> in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that <a1_0><a1_1><a1_2>Porifera<a1_2/><a1_1/><a1_0/> (sponges) is <b4_0>the earliest-diverging animal phylum<b4_0/> instead. Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack <b2_0>any true hox genes<b2_0/>."}
