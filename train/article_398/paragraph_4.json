During this time, <b6_0>the first settlement in southern Mesopotamia<b6_0/> was established at <a2_0>Eridu<a2_0/> (Cuneiform: NUN.KI), c. 5300 BC, by farmers who brought with them <b7_0>the Hadji Muhammed culture<b7_0/>, which first pioneered <a3_0>irrigation<a3_0/> agriculture. It appears that this culture was derived from the Samarran culture from northern Mesopotamia. It is not known whether or not these were the actual Sumerians who are identified with the later Uruk culture. Eridu remained an important religious center when it was gradually surpassed in size by the nearby city of Uruk.
