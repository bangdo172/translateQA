From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote <b6_0>multiplication tables<b6_0/> <a2_0>on clay tablets<a2_0/> and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period. The period c. <a3_0>2700 \u2013 2300 BC<a3_0/> saw the first appearance of the <b7_0>abacus<b7_0/>, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system. The Sumerians were the first to <a4_0>use a place value numeral system<a4_0/>.
