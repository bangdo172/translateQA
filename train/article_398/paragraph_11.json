Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being <a0_0>compromised<a0_0/> as a result of <b6_0>rising salinity<b6_0/>. <a1_0>Soil<a1_0/> salinity in this region had been long recognized as a major problem. Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of <a2_0>dissolved salts<a2_0/> in the soil, eventually <b8_0>reducing agricultural yields<b8_0/> severely. During the Akkadian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of <a3_0><b7_0>wheat<b7_0/><a3_0/> to the more salt-tolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that <b9_0>the population in this area declined<b9_0/> <a4_0>by nearly three fifths<a4_0/>. This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language. Henceforth Sumerian would remain only a literary and liturgical language, similar to the position occupied by Latin in medieval Europe."}
