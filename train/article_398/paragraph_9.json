There are <b7_0>texts written entirely in Old Akkadian<b7_0/> dating from c. 2500 BC. Use of Old Akkadian was at its peak during the rule of <a2_0><b8_0>Sargon the Great<b8_0/><a2_0/> (c. 2270\u20132215 BC), but even then most administrative tablets continued to be written in <a3_0>Sumerian<a3_0/>, the language used by the scribes. Gelb and Westenholz differentiate three stages of Old Akkadian: that of the pre-Sargonic era, that of the Akkadian empire, and that of the \"Neo-Sumerian Renaissance\" that followed it. Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for <a4_0>about one thousand years<a4_0/>, but by around 1800 BC, <b9_0>Sumerian<b9_0/> was becoming more of a literary language familiar mainly only to scholars and scribes. Thorkild Jacobsen has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, and that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a \"Semitic vs. Sumerian\" conflict. However, it is certain that Akkadian was also briefly imposed on neighboring parts of Elam that were previously conquered by Sargon."}
