It shows the king of Lagash leading a Sumerian army consisting mostly of <a3_0>infantry<a3_0/>. The infantrymen carried spears, wore copper helmets, and carried <a4_0>rectangular<a4_0/> shields. The spearmen are shown arranged in what resembles the phalanx formation, which requires training and discipline; this implies that the Sumerians may have made use of professional soldiers."}
