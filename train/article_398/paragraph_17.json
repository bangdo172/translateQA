This continued to influence the whole Mesopotamian mythos. Thus in the Enuma Elish the creation was seen as the union of <a2_0>fresh and salt water<a2_0/>; as male Abzu, and female Tiamat. The product of that union, Lahm and Lahmu, \"<a3_0>the muddy ones<a3_0/>\", were titles given to the gate keepers of the E-Abzu temple of Enki, in Eridu, the first Sumerian city. Describing the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposited its load of silt, a second hieros gamos supposedly created Anshar and Kishar, the \"sky-pivot\" or axle, and the \"earth pivot\", parents in turn of Anu (the sky) and Ki (the earth). Another important Sumerian hieros gamos was that between Ki, here known as <a4_0>Ninhursag<a4_0/> or \"Lady Sacred Mountain\", and Enki of Eridu, the god of fresh water which brought forth greenery and pasture."}
