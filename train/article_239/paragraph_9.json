Under Britain's policy of indirect rule and validation of Islamic tradition, the Crown did not encourage the operation of Christian missions in the <a1_0>northern<a1_0/>, <a2_0>Islamic<a2_0/> part of the country. Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education. By independence in <a3_0>1960<a3_0/>, regional differences in modern educational access were marked. The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present-day. Imbalances between North and South were expressed in Nigeria's political life as well.
