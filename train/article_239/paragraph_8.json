On <a3_0>1 January 1901<a3_0/>, Nigeria became a British protectorate, and part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered <a4_0>Benin<a4_0/> in 1897, and, in the Anglo-Aro War (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule."}
