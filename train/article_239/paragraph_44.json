Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of <a0_0><a2_0>1987<a2_0/><a0_0/>, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing <a1_0>user fees<a1_0/>. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost."}
