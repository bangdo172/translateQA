These scams involve a complicit Nigerian <a4_0>bank<a4_0/> (the laws being set up loosely to allow it) and a scammer who claims to have money he needs to obtain from that bank. The victim is talked into exchanging bank account information on the premise that the money will be transferred to him, and then he'll get to keep a cut. In reality, money is taken out instead, and/or large fees (which seem small in comparison with the imaginary wealth he awaits) are deducted. In <a2_0>2003<a2_0/>, <a1_0>the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission<a1_0/> (or EFCC) was created, ostensibly to combat this and other forms of organised financial crime."}
