If a particle and its antiparticle come into contact with each other, <b1_0>the two annihilate<b1_0/>; that is, they may both be converted into other particles with equal energy in accordance with <b4_0>Einstein<b4_0/>'s equation E = mc2. These new particles may be high-energy photons (<b2_0>gamma rays<b2_0/>) or other particle\u2013antiparticle pairs. The resulting particles are endowed with an amount of <b3_0>kinetic<b3_0/> energy equal to the difference between the rest mass of the products of the annihilation and the rest mass of the original particle\u2013antiparticle pair, which is often quite large."}
