Thales (<b0_0>c. 624 BC\u2013c. 546 BC<b0_0/>) regarded <b1_0>water<b1_0/> as the fundamental material of the world. Anaximander (c. 610 BC\u2013c. 546 BC) posited that the basic material was wholly characterless or limitless: the Infinite (apeiron). Anaximenes (flourished 585 BC, d. 528 BC) posited that the basic stuff was pneuma or air. Heraclitus (c. 535\u2013c. 475 BC) seems to say the basic element is fire, though perhaps he means that all is change. Empedocles (c. 490\u2013430 BC) spoke of <b3_0>four<b3_0/> elements of which everything was made: earth, water, air, and fire. Meanwhile, Parmenides argued that change does not exist, and Democritus argued that everything is composed of minuscule, inert bodies of all shapes called <b4_0>atoms<b4_0/>, a philosophy called <b2_0>atomism<b2_0/>. All of these notions had deep philosophical problems."}
