This definition goes beyond atoms and molecules, however, to include substances made from these building blocks that are not simply atoms or molecules, for example <b2_0>white dwarf<b2_0/> matter\u2014typically, <b3_0>carbon and oxygen nuclei<b3_0/> in a sea of degenerate electrons. At a microscopic level, the constituent \"particles\" of matter such as protons, neutrons, and electrons obey the laws of quantum mechanics and exhibit wave\u2013particle duality. At an even deeper level, <b4_0>protons and neutrons<b4_0/> are made up of quarks and the force fields (gluons) that bind them together (see Quarks and leptons definition below)."}
