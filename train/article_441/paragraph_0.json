This concept of matter may be generalized from atoms to include any objects having mass even when at rest, but this is ill-defined because an object's mass can arise from <b3_0>its (possibly massless) constituents' motion and interaction energies<b3_0/>. Thus, matter does not have a universal definition, nor is it a <b4_0>fundamental<b4_0/> concept in physics today. Matter is also used loosely as a general term for the substance that makes up all observable physical objects."}
