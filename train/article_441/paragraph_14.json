Hence, at zero temperature, the fermions fill up sufficient levels to accommodate all the available fermions\u2014and in the case of many fermions, the maximum kinetic energy (called <b3_0>the <b2_0><b4_0>Fermi energy<b4_0/><b2_0/>) and <b1_0>the pressure of the gas<b3_0/><b1_0/> becomes very large, and depends on the number of fermions rather than the temperature, unlike normal states of matter."}
