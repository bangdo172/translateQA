It is contrasted with nuclear matter, which is a liquid of neutrons and protons (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks), and with non-strange quark matter, which is a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks. At high enough density, strange matter is expected <b2_0>to be color superconducting<b2_0/>. Strange matter is hypothesized to occur in the core of <b3_0>neutron stars<b3_0/>, or, more speculatively, as <b4_0>isolated droplets<b4_0/> that may vary in size from femtometers (strangelets) to kilometers (quark stars)."}
