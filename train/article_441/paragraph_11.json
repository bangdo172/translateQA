Such composites contain an <b1_0>interaction energy<b1_0/> that holds the constituents together, and may constitute the bulk of the mass of the composite. As an example, to a great extent, the mass of an atom is simply the sum of <b2_0>the masses of its constituent<b2_0/> protons, neutrons and electrons. However, digging deeper, the protons and neutrons are made up of quarks bound together by <b3_0>gluon fields<b3_0/> (see dynamics of quantum chromodynamics) and these gluons fields contribute significantly to the mass of hadrons. In other words, most of what composes the \"mass\" of <b4_0>ordinary matter<b4_0/> is due to the binding energy of quarks within protons and neutrons. For example, the sum of the mass of the three quarks in a nucleon is approximately 7001125000000000000\u266012.5 MeV/c2, which is low compared to the mass of a nucleon (approximately 7002938000000000000\u2660938 MeV/c2). The bottom line is that most of the mass of everyday objects comes from the interaction energy of its elementary components."}
