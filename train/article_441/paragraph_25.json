And here is a quote from <b3_0>de Sabbata and Gasperini<b3_0/>: \"With the word \"matter\" we denote, in this context, the sources of the interactions, that is spinor fields (like quarks and leptons), which are believed to be the fundamental components of matter, or scalar fields, like the Higgs particles, which are used to introduced mass in a <b4_0>gauge theory<b4_0/> (and that, however, could be composed of more fundamental fermion fields).\"[further explanation needed]"}
