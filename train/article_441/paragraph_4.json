Some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings, from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass and matter. As such, there is no single universally agreed scientific meaning of the word \"matter\". Scientifically, the term \"<b1_0>mass<b1_0/>\" is well-defined, but \"matter\" is not. Sometimes in the field of physics \"matter\" is simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at <b4_0>the speed of light<b4_0/>), such as quarks and leptons. However, in both physics and chemistry, matter exhibits <b2_0>both wave-like and particle-like properties<b2_0/>, the so-called <b3_0>wave\u2013particle duality<b3_0/>."}
