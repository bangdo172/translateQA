In <b1_0>the early universe<b1_0/>, it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented, and the disappearance of antimatter requires an <b0_0>asymmetry in physical laws<b0_0/> called the charge parity (or CP symmetry) violation. <b3_0>CP symmetry violation<b3_0/> can be obtained from the Standard Model, but at this time <b2_0>the apparent asymmetry of matter and antimatter<b2_0/> in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics. Possible processes by which it came about are explored in more detail under baryogenesis."}
