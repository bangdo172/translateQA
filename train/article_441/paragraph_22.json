The matter is not specifically described (e.g., as atoms), but consists of whatever persists in the change of substance from grass to horse. <b0_0>Matter<b0_0/> in this understanding does not exist independently (i.e., as a substance), but exists interdependently (i.e., as a \"principle\") with form and only insofar as it underlies change. It can be helpful to conceive of the relationship of matter and form as very similar to that between parts and whole. For <b1_0>Aristotle<b1_0/>, matter as such can only receive actuality from form; it has no activity or actuality in itself, similar to the way that parts as such only have their existence in <b2_0>a whole<b2_0/> (otherwise they would be independent wholes)."}
