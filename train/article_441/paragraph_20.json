Observational evidence of the early universe and the big bang theory require that this matter have energy and mass, but is not composed of either <b3_0>elementary fermions (as above) OR gauge bosons<b3_0/>. The commonly accepted view is that most of the <b2_0>dark matter<b2_0/> is non-baryonic in nature. As such, it is composed of particles as yet unobserved in the laboratory. Perhaps they are supersymmetric particles, which are not <b4_0>Standard<b4_0/> Model particles, but relics formed at very high energies in the early phase of the universe and still floating about."}
