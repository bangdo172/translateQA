This atomic matter is in turn made up of interacting subatomic particles\u2014usually <b1_0>a nucleus<b1_0/> of protons and neutrons, and <b0_0>a cloud<b0_0/> of orbiting electrons. Typically, science considers these composite particles matter because they have both rest mass and volume. By contrast, massless particles, such as photons, are not considered matter, because they have neither rest mass nor volume. However, not all particles with rest mass have a <b2_0>classical<b2_0/> volume, since fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons (sometimes equated with matter) are considered \"point particles\" with no <b4_0>effective<b4_0/> size or volume. Nevertheless, <b3_0>quarks and leptons<b3_0/> together make up \"ordinary matter\", and their interactions contribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter."}
