Descartes makes an absolute distinction between <b1_0>mind<b1_0/>, which he defines as unextended, thinking substance, and matter, which he defines as unthinking, extended substance. They are independent things. In contrast, Aristotle defines matter and the formal/forming principle <b4_0>as complementary principles<b4_0/> that together compose one independent thing (substance). In short, Aristotle defines matter (roughly speaking) as what things are actually made of (with a potential independent existence), but Descartes elevates matter <b2_0>to an actual independent thing in itself<b2_0/>."}
