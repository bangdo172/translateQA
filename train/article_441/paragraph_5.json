Thus, in relativity usually a more general view is that it is not the sum of rest masses, but the energy\u2013momentum tensor that <b2_0>quantifies the amount of matter<b2_0/>. This tensor gives the rest mass for the entire system. \"Matter\" therefore is sometimes considered as anything that contributes to <b3_0>the energy\u2013momentum<b3_0/> of a system, that is, anything that is not purely gravity. This view is commonly held in fields that deal with general relativity such as <b4_0>cosmology<b4_0/>. In this view, light and other massless particles and fields are part of matter."}
