However, advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases, such as <b1_0>Bose\u2013Einstein<b1_0/> condensates and fermionic condensates. A focus on an elementary-particle view of matter also leads to new phases of matter, such as the <b3_0>quark\u2013gluon<b3_0/> plasma. For <b4_0>much of the history<b4_0/> of the natural sciences people have contemplated the exact nature of matter. The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called particulate theory of matter, was first put forward by the Greek philosophers <b2_0>Leucippus<b2_0/> (~490 BC) and Democritus (~470\u2013380 BC)."}
