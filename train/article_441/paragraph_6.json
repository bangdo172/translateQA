For example, light radiation (or <b1_0>thermal radiation<b1_0/>) trapped inside a box would contribute to the mass of the box, as would any kind of energy inside the box, including the kinetic energy of particles held by the box. Nevertheless, isolated individual particles of light (<b2_0>photons<b2_0/>) and the isolated kinetic energy of massive particles, are normally not considered to be matter.[citation needed]"}
