A phase is a form of matter that has a relatively uniform chemical composition and physical properties (such as density, specific heat, refractive index, and so forth). These phases include the <b2_0>three<b2_0/> familiar ones (solids, liquids, and gases), as well as more exotic states of matter (such as <b3_0>plasmas, superfluids, supersolids, Bose\u2013Einstein condensates<b3_0/>, ...). A fluid may be a liquid, gas or plasma. There are also paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials. As conditions change, matter may change from one phase into another. These phenomena are called phase transitions, and are studied in the field of <b4_0>thermodynamics<b4_0/>. In nanomaterials, the vastly increased ratio of surface area to volume results in matter that can exhibit properties entirely different from those of bulk material, and not well described by any bulk phase (see nanomaterials for more details)."}
