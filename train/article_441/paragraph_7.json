Only \"rest mass\" is loosely equated with <b1_0>matter<b1_0/> (since it can be weighed). Invariant mass is usually applied in physics to <b2_0>unbound<b2_0/> systems of particles. However, energies which contribute to the \"invariant mass\" may be weighed also in special circumstances, such as when a system that has invariant mass is confined and has no <b3_0>net momentum<b3_0/> (as in the box example above). Thus, a photon with no mass may (confusingly) still add mass to a system in which it is trapped. The same is true of the kinetic energy of particles, which by definition is not part of their rest mass, but which does add <b4_0>rest<b4_0/> mass to systems in which these particles reside (an example is the mass added by the motion of gas molecules of a bottle of gas, or by the thermal energy of any hot object)."}
