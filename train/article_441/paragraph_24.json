In the third of his \"<b1_0>Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy<b1_0/>\", Newton lists the universal qualities of matter as \"<b3_0>extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and inertia<b3_0/>\". Similarly in Optics he conjectures that God created matter as \"solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles\", which were \"...even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces\". The \"primary\" properties of matter were amenable to <b4_0>mathematical<b4_0/> description, unlike \"secondary\" qualities such as color or taste. Like Descartes, Newton rejected <b2_0>the essential nature of secondary qualities<b2_0/>."}
