Though the term derives from the humorous (or comic) work that predominated in early American newspaper comic strips, it has become standard also for non-humorous works. It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as <a4_0><b9_0>manga<b9_0/><a4_0/> for Japanese comics, or <a0_0><b5_0>bandes dessin\u00e9es<b5_0/><a0_0/> for French-language comics. There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of <a3_0><b8_0>images and text<b8_0/><a3_0/>, some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of <a2_0><b7_0>recurring characters<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The increasing cross-pollination of concepts from different comics cultures and eras has further made definition difficult."}
