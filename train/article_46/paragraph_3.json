Europeans have seen their tradition as beginning with the Swiss <a0_0><b4_0><b5_0>Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer<b5_0/><b4_0/><a0_0/> from as early as 1827 and Americans have seen the origin of theirs in <a1_0><b6_0>Richard F. Outcault<b6_0/><a1_0/>'s <a2_0><b7_0>1890s<b7_0/><a2_0/> newspaper strip The Yellow Kid, though many Americans have come to recognize T\u00f6pffer's precedence. Japan had a long prehistory of <a3_0><b8_0>satirical<b8_0/><a3_0/> cartoons and comics leading up to the World War II era. The ukiyo-e artist Hokusai popularized the Japanese term for comics and cartooning, manga, in the early 19th century. In the post-war era modern Japanese comics began to flourish when Osamu Tezuka produced a prolific body of work. Towards the close of the 20th century, these three traditions converged in a trend towards book-length comics: the comics album in Europe, the tank\u014dbon[a] in Japan, and the graphic novel in the English-speaking countries."}
