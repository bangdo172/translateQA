The French term for comics, <a0_0><b4_0><b5_0>bandes dessin\u00e9es<b5_0/><b4_0/><a0_0/> (\"<a2_0><b7_0>drawn strip<b7_0/><a2_0/>\") emphasizes the juxtaposition of <a3_0><b8_0>drawn images<b8_0/><a3_0/> as a defining factor, which can imply the exclusion of even photographic comics. The term <a1_0><b6_0>manga<b6_0/><a1_0/> is used in Japanese to indicate all forms of comics, cartooning, and caricature."}
