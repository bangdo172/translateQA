Cartoonists began creating comics for mature audiences, and the term \"<a0_0><b4_0>Ninth Art<b4_0/><a0_0/>\"[e] was coined, as comics began to attract public and academic attention as an artform. A group including Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and Albert Uderzo founded the magazine Pilote in <a1_0><b5_0>1959<b5_0/><a1_0/> to give artists greater freedom over their work. Goscinny and Uderzo's The <a2_0><b6_0><b7_0>Adventures of Asterix<b7_0/><b6_0/><a2_0/> appeared in it and went on to become the best-selling French-language comics series. From 1960, the satirical and taboo-breaking Hara-Kiri defied censorship laws in the countercultural spirit that led to the May 1968 events."}
