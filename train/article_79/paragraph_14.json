Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, <a3_0>Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca<a3_0/>, to disregard Virgil's own wish that <a4_0>the poem be burned<a4_0/>, instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible. As a result, the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e. not a complete line of dactylic hexameter). Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect. Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate."}
