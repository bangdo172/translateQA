The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between <a3_0>Augustus<a3_0/> and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome. A strong teleology, or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem. The Aeneid is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the Carthaginian Wars; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus' victory at <b5_0>Actium<b5_0/> against Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII in <a0_0><b4_0>31 BC<b4_0/><a0_0/>. A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas. As the protagonist of the poem, <a1_0>Aeneas<a1_0/> seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found <b6_0>Rome<b6_0/>; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas' emotional control in <b8_0>the last sections of the poem<b8_0/> where the \"pious\" and \"righteous\" Aeneas <b7_0>mercilessly<b7_0/> slaughters <a2_0>Turnus<a2_0/>."}
