The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage, which historically was Rome's deadliest foe. The queen, <a1_0>Dido<a1_0/>, welcomes the ancestor of the Romans, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him. At a banquet in Book 2, Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy, the death of his wife, and his escape, to the enthralled Carthaginians, while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home. Jupiter in Book <b7_0>4<b7_0/> recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty <b9_0>to found a new city<b9_0/>, and he slips away from <b6_0>Carthage<b6_0/>, leaving <b5_0>Dido<b5_0/> to commit <b8_0>suicide<b8_0/>, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in a symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome. In Book <a2_0>5<a2_0/>, Aeneas' father Anchises dies and funeral games are celebrated for him. On reaching Cumae, in Italy in Book 6, Aeneas consults the Cumaean <a4_0>Sibyl<a4_0/>, who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead <a3_0>Anchises<a3_0/> who reveals Rome's destiny to his son."}
