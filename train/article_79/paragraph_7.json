The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of <a2_0>running a farm<a2_0/>. In handling this theme, Virgil follows in the didactic (\"how to\") tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets. The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on <b8_0>raising crops<b8_0/> and trees (1 and 2), livestock and horses (3), and <b7_0>beekeeping<b7_0/> and the qualities of bees (4). Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2, the prologue description of the temple in Book 3, and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3. Book <b6_0>4<b6_0/> concludes with a long mythological narrative, in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by <b5_0>Aristaeus<b5_0/> and the story of Orpheus' journey to the underworld. Ancient scholars, such as Servius, conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced, at the emperor's request, a long section in praise of Virgil's friend, the poet <a3_0>Gallus<a3_0/>, who was disgraced by <a4_0>Augustus<a4_0/>, and who committed suicide in 26 BC."}
