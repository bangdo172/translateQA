Traditionally Jews and Christians living in Muslim lands, known as <a0_0>dhimmis<a0_0/>, were allowed to practice their religions and administer their internal affairs, but they were subject to certain conditions. They had to pay the <a1_0>jizya<a1_0/> (a per capita tax imposed on <b5_0>free adult non-Muslim males<b5_0/>) to the Islamic state. <a2_0><b6_0>Dhimmis<b6_0/><a2_0/> had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal disabilities such as <b7_0>prohibitions against bearing arms<b7_0/> or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims. Many of the disabilities were highly symbolic. The one described by Bernard Lewis as \"most degrading\" was <b8_0>the <a3_0>requirement of distinctive clothing<b8_0/><a3_0/>, not found in the Quran or hadith but invented in early medieval Baghdad; its enforcement was highly erratic. On the other hand, Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession."}
