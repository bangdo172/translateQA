Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French-controlled Maghreb region, 15\u201320% in the Kingdom of Iraq, approximately 10% in the Kingdom of Egypt and approximately <b4_0>7<b4_0/>% in the Kingdom of Yemen. A further 200,000 lived in Pahlavi Iran and the Republic of Turkey. Today, around 26,000 Jews live in Arab countries and around 30,000 in Iran and Turkey. A small-scale exodus had begun in many countries in the <a1_0>early decades of the 20th century<a1_0/>, although the only substantial aliyah came from <a2_0>Yemen and Syria<a2_0/>. The exodus from Arab and Muslim countries took place primarily from 1948. The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily in <b6_0>Iraq, Yemen and Libya<b6_0/>, with up to 90% of these communities leaving within a few years. The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956. The exodus in the Maghreb countries peaked in the 1960s. Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of refugees from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. In the aftermath of the exodus wave from Arab states, an additional migration of Iranian Jews peaked in the <b7_0>1980s<b7_0/> when around 80% of Iranian Jews left the country.[citation needed]"}
