Another factor that would have made conversion difficult in the Roman world was <b5_0>the halakhic requirement of circumcision<b5_0/>, a requirement that proselytizing Christianity quickly dropped. <a0_0>The <b7_0>Fiscus Judaicus<b7_0/><a0_0/>, a tax imposed on Jews in 70 CE and relaxed to exclude Christians in <a1_0><b6_0>96 CE<b6_0/><a1_0/>, also limited Judaism's appeal. In addition, historians argue the very figure (4 million) that had been guessed to account for the population of Jews in the ancient Roman Empire is an error that has long been disproven and thus the assumption that conversion impacted Jewish population growth in ancient Rome on a large scale is false. The 8 million figure is also in doubt as it may refer to a census of total Roman citizens."}
