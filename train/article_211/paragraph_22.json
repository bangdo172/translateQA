They show that Jewish populations have tended to form relatively closely related groups in independent communities, with most in a community sharing significant ancestry in common. For Jewish populations of the diaspora, <b5_0>the genetic composition of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi Jewish populations<b5_0/> show a predominant amount of shared Middle Eastern ancestry. According to Behar, the most parsimonious explanation for this shared Middle Eastern ancestry is that it is \"<b7_0>consistent with the historical formulation of the Jewish people<b7_0/> as descending from ancient Hebrew and Israelite residents of the Levant\" and \"the dispersion of the people of ancient Israel throughout the Old World\". North African, Italian and others of Iberian origin show variable frequencies of admixture with non-Jewish historical host populations among the maternal lines. In the case of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews (in particular Moroccan Jews), who are closely related, the source of non-Jewish admixture is mainly southern European, while Mizrahi Jews show evidence of admixture with other <a2_0>Middle Eastern populations and Sub-Saharan Africans<a2_0/>. Behar et al. have remarked on an especially close relationship of Ashkenazi Jews and <b6_0>modern Italians<b6_0/>."}
