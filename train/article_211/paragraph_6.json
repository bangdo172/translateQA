The term <b6_0>Jew<b6_0/> originated from the <a1_0>Roman \"Judean<a1_0/>\" and denoted someone from the southern kingdom of Judah. The shift of ethnonym from \"Israelites\" to \"<a3_0>Jews<a3_0/>\" (inhabitant of Judah), although not contained in the Torah, is made explicit in the Book of Esther (4th century BCE), a book in the Ketuvim, the third section of the Jewish Tanakh. In <b7_0>587 BC<b7_0/> Nebuchadnezzar II, King of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, besieged Jerusalem, destroyed the First Temple, and deported the most prominent citizens of Judah. In <b8_0>586 BC<b8_0/>, Judah itself ceased to be an independent kingdom, and its remaining Jews were left stateless. The Babylonian exile ended in <a4_0>539 BCE<a4_0/> when the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylon and Cyrus the Great allowed the exiled Jews to return to Yehud and rebuild their Temple. The Second Temple was completed in 515 BCE. Yehud province was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Jews were also politically independent during the Hasmonean dynasty spanning from 140 to 37 BCE and to some degree under the Herodian dynasty from 37 BCE to 6 CE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple in <b9_0>70 CE<b9_0/>, most Jews have lived in diaspora. As an ethnic minority in every country in which they live (except Israel), they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history, resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution over the centuries.[citation needed]"}
