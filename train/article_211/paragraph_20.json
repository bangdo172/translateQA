Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as <b5_0>the early 20th century<b5_0/>, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are <a2_0><b7_0>Hebrew, English, and Russian<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. <a0_0>Yiddish<a0_0/> has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel. In some places, the mother language of the Jewish community differs from that of the general population or the dominant group. For example, in Quebec, the Ashkenazic majority has adopted <b8_0>English<b8_0/>, while the Sephardic minority uses French as its primary language. Similarly, South African Jews adopted <a3_0>English<a3_0/> rather than Afrikaans. Due to both Czarist and Soviet policies, Russian has superseded Yiddish as the language of Russian Jews, but these policies have also affected neighboring communities. Today, Russian is the first language for many Jewish communities in a number of Post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan, as well as for Ashkenazic Jews in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Tajikistan. Although communities in North Africa today are small and dwindling, Jews there had shifted from a multilingual group to a monolingual one (or nearly so), speaking French in Algeria, Morocco, and the city of Tunis, while most <a1_0><b9_0>North Africans<b9_0/><a1_0/> continue to use Arabic as their mother tongue.[citation needed]"}
