By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. <a5_0><b9_0>An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair<b9_0/><a5_0/>. However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, \"<b10_0>might not have jumped to the notion of a chair<b10_0/>\", but instead <a6_0>\"might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape.\"<a6_0/> This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Moreover, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog <a7_0>\"<b11_0>would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such<b11_0/>.\"<a7_0/> In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the <a2_0><a8_0>causal relationships<a8_0/><a2_0/> that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a <a3_0>higher grade mentality<a3_0/> (as the artist illustrates)."}
