The term he coined was \"<a0_0>prehension<a0_0/>\", which <a5_0>comes from the <a1_0>Latin<a1_0/> prehensio, meaning \"<a2_0><b12_0>to seize<b12_0/><a2_0/>.\"<a5_0/> The term is meant to indicate <a6_0>a kind of <b13_0>perception that can be <a3_0>conscious or unconscious<a3_0/>, applying to people as well as electrons<b13_0/><a6_0/>. It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of representative perception, in which <a7_0>the <b11_0>mind only has private ideas about other entities<b11_0/><a7_0/>. For Whitehead, the term \"prehension\" indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself. In this way, <a8_0><b10_0>entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations<b10_0/>, rather than being independent of them<a8_0/>. Further, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in <a4_0>two<a4_0/> modes, <a9_0>causal efficacy (or \"physical prehension\") and presentational immediacy (or \"conceptual prehension\")<a9_0/>."}
