After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and <a4_0>it is <b7_0>easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things<b7_0/><a4_0/>, rather than constantly keeping in mind that <a2_0>each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago<a2_0/>. Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech <a5_0><b8_0>should not prevent people from realizing that \"material substances\" or \"essences\" are a convenient generalized description<b8_0/> of a continuum<a5_0/> of particular, concrete processes. No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that <a6_0>it is not philosophically or ontologically sound<a6_0/> to think that a person is the same from one second to the next."}
