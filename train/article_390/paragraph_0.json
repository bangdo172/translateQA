Whitehead argued that reality consists of <a4_0><a7_0>processes<a7_0/><a4_0/> rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that <a8_0><b14_0>reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another<a8_0/>.<b14_0/> Today Whitehead's philosophical works \u2013 particularly <a9_0><b11_0><b12_0>Process<b11_0/> and Reality<b12_0/><a9_0/> \u2013 are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy."}
