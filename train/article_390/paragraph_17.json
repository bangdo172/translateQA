In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being <a6_0><b9_0>qualitative and secondary to their core identity<b9_0/><a6_0/> (e.g. \"Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, but he is still the same person\"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are <a7_0><b10_0>discrete \"<a1_0><b12_0>occasions of experience<b12_0/><a1_0/>\" that overlap one another in <a2_0>time and space<b10_0/><a2_0/>, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing<a7_0/>. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as \"the essence of a thing\" or \"the identity/core of a person\" is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. Identities do not define people, <a3_0>people define identities<a3_0/>. Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having an \"enduring <b11_0>essence<b11_0/>\" misses the fact that \"<a4_0>all things flow\"<a4_0/>, though it is often a useful way of speaking."}
