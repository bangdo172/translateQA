In the notes of one his students for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: <a4_0>\"<b8_0>Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized<b8_0/>.\"<a4_0/> In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers <a0_0>make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works<a0_0/> all the time, but <a5_0>such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because <a1_0>they remain unexamined and unquestioned<a5_0/><a1_0/>. While Whitehead acknowledged that \"philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles,\" he argued that <a6_0><b9_0>people need to continually re-imagine their <a2_0>basic assumptions about how the universe works<b9_0/><a2_0/> if philosophy and science are to make any real progress<a6_0/>, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic. For this reason <a7_0>Whitehead <b10_0>regarded <a3_0>metaphysical investigations<a3_0/> as essential to both good science and good philosophy<b10_0/><a7_0/>."}
