He articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to Einstein's general relativity, see Whitehead's theory of gravitation. <a0_0>It has been <b5_0>severely criticized<b5_0/><a0_0/>. Yutaka Tanaka, who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings, proposes that Einstein's work does not actually refute Whitehead's formulation. <a1_0><b6_0>Whitehead's view has now been rendered obsolete, with the discovery of gravitational waves<a1_0/>.<b6_0/> They are <a2_0><b7_0>phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that Whitehead assumes<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Consequently, <a3_0>Whitehead's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation<a3_0/>, and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry, Minkowskian in particular, as an often-locally-adequate approximation. An exact replacement of Whitehead's cosmology would need to admit a Riemannian geometry. Also, although Whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory, his metaphysics of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field. <a4_0>Henry Stapp and David Bohm<a4_0/> are among those whose work has been influenced by Whitehead."}
