Bisbee-Douglas International Airport in Arizona was declared \"the first international airport of the Americas\" by <b6_0>US president Franklin D. Roosevelt<b6_0/> <b7_0>in 1943<b7_0/>. Pearson Field Airport in Vancouver, Washington had a dirigible land in 1905 and planes in 1911 and is still in use. Bremen Airport opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field <b8_0>between 1945 and 1949<b8_0/>. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened on September 16, 1916 as a military airfield, but only accepted civil aircraft from December 17, 1920, allowing Sydney Airport in Sydney, Australia\u2014which started operations in January 1920\u2014to claim to be one of the world's oldest continually operating commercial airports.

Increased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope."}
