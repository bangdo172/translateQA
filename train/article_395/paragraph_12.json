This coordinated oversight facilitates <b4_0>safety and speed in complex operations<b4_0/> where traffic moves in all three dimensions. Air traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided <b5_0>into at least <a1_0>two<a1_0/> main areas: ground and tower<b5_0/>, though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports also have clearance delivery, apron control, and other specialized ATC stations."}
