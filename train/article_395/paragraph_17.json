Rather, aircraft (<b7_0>usually only <a2_0>commercial with long routes<b7_0/><a2_0/>) request approach clearance <b4_0>while they are still hours away from the airport, often before they even take off from their departure point<b4_0/>. Large airports have a frequency called <a1_0>Clearance Delivery<a1_0/> which is used by departing aircraft specifically for this purpose. This then allows aircraft to <b5_0>take the most direct approach path to the runway and land<b5_0/> without worrying about interference from other aircraft. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that <b6_0>controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off<b6_0/>; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air."}
