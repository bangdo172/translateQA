A <a0_0><a1_0>visual approach slope indicator<a1_0/><a0_0/> (VASI) <b5_0>helps pilots fly the approach for landing<b5_0/>. Some airports are equipped with a <a2_0><a3_0>VHF omnidirectional range<a3_0/><a2_0/> (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a <b6_0><b7_0>distance measuring equipment<b7_0/> (DME)<b6_0/> to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located <b8_0>off airports<b8_0/>, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an <a4_0>instrument landing system<a4_0/> (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. <b9_0>The number of instrument approaches<b9_0/> based on the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually be the primary means for instrument landings."}
