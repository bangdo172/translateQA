They may <b4_0>help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft<b4_0/>. There is no technical need within modern aviation for <b5_0>performing this pattern<b5_0/>, provided there is no queue. And due to the <a2_0>so-called <b6_0>SLOT-times<b6_0/><a2_0/>, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment, <b7_0>things are very different<b7_0/>ly though."}
