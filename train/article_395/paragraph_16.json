Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, <b4_0>usually <a0_0>800 or 1,000 ft<a0_0/> (244 or 305 m)<b4_0/> <a1_0>above ground level<a1_0/> (AGL). <a3_0>Standard traffic patterns are <a2_0>left-handed<a3_0/><a2_0/>, meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that <b5_0>pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern<b5_0/>. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents.
