This is referred to as <a2_0>analog-to-digital<a2_0/> (A/D) conversion. If the integers generated by quantization are 8 bits each, then the entire range of the analog signal is divided into <b5_0>256<b5_0/> intervals and all the signal values within an interval are quantized to <b6_0>the same number<b6_0/>. If 16-bit integers are generated, then the range of the analog signal is divided into <b4_0>65,536<b4_0/> intervals."}
