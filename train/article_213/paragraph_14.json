Some <a1_0><b4_0>codecs<b4_0/><a1_0/> will analyze a longer segment of the data to optimize efficiency, and then code it in a manner that requires a larger segment of data at one time to decode. (Often <a2_0><b5_0>codecs<b5_0/><a2_0/> create segments called <b7_0>a \"frame\"<b7_0/> to create discrete data segments for encoding and decoding.)
