The sequence of frames contains spatial and temporal redundancy that video compression algorithms attempt to eliminate or code in a smaller size. Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between frames, or by using perceptual features of human vision. For example, small differences in <b5_0>color<b5_0/> are more difficult to perceive than are <b7_0>changes in brightness<b7_0/>. <a1_0><b4_0>Compression algorithms<b4_0/><a1_0/> can average a <a2_0>color<a2_0/> across these similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to <b6_0>those used in JPEG image compression<b6_0/>. Some of these methods are inherently lossy while others may preserve all relevant information from the original, uncompressed video."}
