Another difference between intraframe and interframe compression is that, with intraframe systems, each frame uses a similar amount of data. In most interframe systems, certain frames (such as \"I frames\" in MPEG-2) aren't allowed to <b7_0>copy data from other frames<b7_0/>, so they require much more data than other frames nearby."}
