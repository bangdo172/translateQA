It can achieve superior compression to other techniques such as the better-known <a2_0><b5_0>Huffman algorithm<b5_0/><a2_0/>. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one-to-one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. <b6_0>Arithmetic coding<b6_0/> applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are context-dependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the probability distribution of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was its use as an optional (but not widely used) feature of the JPEG image coding standard. It has since been applied in <b7_0>various other designs including H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and HEVC<b7_0/> for video coding."}
