Thus, one can consider <a2_0><b5_0>data compression<b5_0/><a2_0/> as data differencing with empty source data, the compressed file corresponding to a \"difference from nothing.\" This is the same as considering absolute entropy (corresponding to data compression) as a special case of relative entropy (corresponding to data differencing) with no initial data."}
