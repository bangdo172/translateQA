DEFLATE is a variation on LZ optimized for decompression speed and compression ratio, but compression can be slow. <a1_0><b6_0>DEFLATE<b6_0/><a1_0/> is used in PKZIP, Gzip and PNG. LZW (Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch) is used in GIF images. Also noteworthy is the <a2_0><b7_0>LZR<b7_0/><a2_0/> (Lempel-Ziv\u2013Renau) algorithm, which serves as the basis for the Zip method.[citation needed] LZ methods use a table-based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data. For most LZ methods, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input. The table itself is often Huffman encoded (e.g. SHRI, LZX). Current LZ-based coding schemes that perform well are <a3_0><b8_0>Brotli<b8_0/><a3_0/> and LZX. <a4_0><b9_0>LZX<b9_0/><a4_0/> is used in Microsoft's CAB format."}
