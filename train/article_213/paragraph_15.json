In the minimum case, <a1_0><b4_0>latency<b4_0/><a1_0/> is zero samples (e.g., if the <b7_0>coder/decoder<b7_0/> simply reduces the number of bits used to quantize the signal). Time domain algorithms such as <a2_0>LPC<a2_0/> also often have low latencies, hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony. In algorithms such as MP3, however, a large number of samples have to be analyzed to implement a <b5_0>psychoacoustic model<b5_0/> in the frequency domain, and latency is on the order of <b6_0>23 ms<b6_0/> (46 ms for two-way communication))."}
