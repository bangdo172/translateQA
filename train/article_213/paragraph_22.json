If the frame contains areas where nothing has moved, <a1_0><b4_0>the system simply issues a short command<b4_0/><a1_0/> that copies that part of the previous frame, bit-for-bit, into the next one. If sections of the frame move in a simple manner, <b7_0>the compressor emits <b6_0>a (slightly longer) command<b7_0/><b6_0/> that tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, lighten, or darken the copy. This <a0_0><b3_0>longer command<b3_0/><a0_0/> still remains much shorter than intraframe compression. Interframe compression works well for programs that will simply be played back by the viewer, but can cause problems if the <a2_0><b5_0>video<b5_0/><a2_0/> sequence needs to be edited."}
