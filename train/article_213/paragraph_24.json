The DCT that is widely used in this regard was introduced by <b7_0>N. Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao<b7_0/> in 1974. Other methods, such as <a2_0><b5_0>fractal compression<b5_0/><a2_0/>, matching pursuit and the use of a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) have been the subject of some research, but are typically not used in practical products (except for the use of wavelet coding as still-image coders without motion compensation). Interest in fractal compression seems to be waning, due to recent theoretical analysis showing a comparative lack of effectiveness of such methods."}
