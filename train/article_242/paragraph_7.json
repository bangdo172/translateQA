The <b5_0>non-conductive region<b5_0/> is called <a1_0>the dielectric<a1_0/>. In simpler terms, the dielectric is just an electrical insulator. Examples of <b6_0><b9_0>dielectric<b9_0/><b6_0/> media are glass, air, paper, vacuum, and even a semiconductor depletion region chemically identical to the conductors. A capacitor is assumed to be self-contained and isolated, with <a2_0><b7_0>no net electric charge<b7_0/><a2_0/> and no influence from any external electric field. The conductors thus hold <a3_0><b8_0>equal and opposite charges<b8_0/><a3_0/> on their facing surfaces, and <a4_0>the dielectric<a4_0/> develops an electric field. In SI units, a capacitance of one farad means that one coulomb of charge on each conductor causes a voltage of one volt across the device."}
