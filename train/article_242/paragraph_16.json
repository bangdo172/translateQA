Voltage reversal is encountered in RLC circuits that are <a2_0>under-damped<a2_0/>. The current and voltage reverse direction, forming <a3_0>a harmonic oscillator<a3_0/> between the inductance and capacitance. The current and voltage will tend to oscillate and may reverse direction several times, with each peak being lower than the previous, until the system reaches an equilibrium. This is often referred to as ringing. In comparison, critically damped or over-damped systems usually do not experience <a4_0>a voltage reversal<a4_0/>. Reversal is also encountered in AC circuits, where the peak current will be equal in each direction."}
