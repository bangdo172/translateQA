Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or <a0_0><b5_0>can be assumed to be linear<b5_0/><a0_0/>, and can be dealt with by adding <a1_0><b6_0>virtual components<b6_0/><a1_0/> to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor. <a2_0><b7_0>The usual methods of network analysis<b7_0/><a2_0/> can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is non-linear and <a3_0><b8_0>normal (i.e., linear) network analysis<b8_0/> cannot be used<a3_0/>, the effect must be dealt with separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is <a4_0><b9_0>temperature dependence<b9_0/><a4_0/>. Finally, combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance, resistance, or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation."}
