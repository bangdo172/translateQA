Vibration moves the plates, causing <a1_0>the <b6_0>capacitance<b6_0/><a1_0/> to vary, in turn inducing <a2_0><b7_0>AC current<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity. The resulting interference is especially problematic in <a3_0><b8_0>audio applications<b8_0/><a3_0/>, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In <a4_0>the <b9_0>reverse microphonic effect<b9_0/><a4_0/>, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. This can generate audible sound, but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte, if any."}
