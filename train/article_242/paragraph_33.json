If the inductance is large enough, the energy will generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. <a2_0><b7_0>A snubber capacitor<b7_0/><a2_0/> across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in <a3_0><b8_0>contact breaker ignition systems<b8_0/><a3_0/>, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which <a4_0>a <b9_0>filter capacitor<a4_0/> absorbs<b9_0/>. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package."}
