For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable-camera flash unit, powered by a 1.5 volt AA battery, has a capacitor which may contain <a0_0><b5_0>over 15 joules of energy<b5_0/><a0_0/> and be charged to <a1_0><b6_0>over 300 volts<b6_0/><a1_0/>. This is easily capable of delivering a shock. Service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high-voltage capacitors, for instance using <a2_0>a <b7_0>Brinkley stick<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Capacitors may also have built-in discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a safe level within a few seconds after power is removed. High-voltage capacitors are stored <a3_0>with the <b8_0>terminals shorted<b8_0/><a3_0/>, as protection from potentially dangerous voltages due to dielectric absorption or from transient voltages the capacitor may pick up <a4_0>from <b9_0>static charges<b9_0/><a4_0/> or passing weather events."}
