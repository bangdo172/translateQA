On discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it, after a short time it may develop a voltage due to <a0_0><b5_0>hysteresis in the dielectric<b5_0/><a0_0/>. This effect can be objectionable in applications such as precision sample and hold circuits or timing circuits. The level of absorption depends on many factors, from design considerations to charging time, since the absorption is a <a1_0><b6_0>time-dependent<b6_0/><a1_0/> process. However, the primary factor is the type of dielectric material. Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit <a2_0><b7_0>very high absorption<b7_0/><a2_0/>, while polystyrene or Teflon allow <a3_0><b8_0>very small levels of absorption<b8_0/><a3_0/>. In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist, such as in flashtubes, television sets, and defibrillators, the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged. Any capacitor containing <a4_0>over <b9_0>10 joules of energy<b9_0/><a4_0/> is generally considered hazardous, while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal. A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20% of its original charge over a period of several minutes, allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous."}
