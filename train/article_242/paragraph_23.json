They are commonly used in electric motor circuits and are often designed to handle large currents, so they tend to be physically large. They are usually ruggedly packaged, often in metal cases that can be easily grounded/earthed. They also are designed with direct current breakdown voltages of <a4_0><b9_0>at least five times the maximum AC<b9_0/> voltage<a4_0/>."}
