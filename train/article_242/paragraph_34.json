To start the motor, a secondary \"start\" winding has a <a1_0><b6_0>series non-polarized starting capacitor<b6_0/><a1_0/> to <a2_0>introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current<a2_0/>. When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle with respect to the primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) <a3_0>disconnects the capacitor<a3_0/>. The start capacitor is typically mounted <a4_0>to <b8_0>the side of the motor<b8_0/> housing<a4_0/>. These are called <b7_0>capacitor-start motors<b7_0/>, that have relatively high starting torque. Typically they can have up-to four times as much starting torque than a split-phase motor and are used on applications such as compressors, pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques."}
