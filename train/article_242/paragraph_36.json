Capacitors used in RF or sustained high-current applications can <a1_0><b6_0>overheat<b6_0/><a1_0/>, especially in the center of the capacitor rolls. Capacitors used within high-energy capacitor banks can <a2_0><b7_0>violently explode<b7_0/><a2_0/> when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit. <a3_0><b8_0>High voltage vacuum capacitors<b8_0/><a3_0/> can generate soft X-rays even during normal operation.
