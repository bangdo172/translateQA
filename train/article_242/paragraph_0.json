The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least <a1_0>two electrical conductors<a1_0/> (plates) separated by <a2_0>a <b7_0>dielectric<b7_0/><a2_0/> (i.e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized). The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. Instead, a capacitor stores energy in <a3_0><b8_0>the form of an electrostatic field<b8_0/><a3_0/> <a4_0><b9_0>between its plates<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
