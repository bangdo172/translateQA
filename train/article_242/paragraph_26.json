For small values of capacitance (<a0_0><b5_0>microfarads and less<b5_0/><a0_0/>), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values can be made by <a1_0><b6_0>multiple stacks of plates and disks<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or <a4_0><b9_0>metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film<b9_0/><a4_0/> to make the plates, and a dielectric film of <a2_0><b7_0>impregnated paper or plastic<b7_0/> \u2013 these are rolled up to save space<a2_0/>. <a3_0><b8_0>To reduce the series resistance and inductance<a3_0/> for long plates<b8_0/>, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates."}
