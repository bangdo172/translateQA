Larger capacitors like electrolytics usually <a0_0>display the actual capacitance together with the unit (for example, <b5_0>220 \u03bcF<b5_0/>)<a0_0/>. Smaller capacitors like ceramics, however, use a shorthand consisting of <a1_0><b6_0>three numeric digits and a letter<b6_0/><a1_0/>, where <a2_0>the <b7_0>digits indicate the capacitance<b7_0/><a2_0/> <a4_0><b9_0>in pF<b9_0/><a4_0/> (calculated as XY \u00d7 10Z for digits XYZ) and <a3_0><b8_0>the letter indicates the tolerance<b8_0/><a3_0/> (J, K or M for \u00b15%, \u00b110% and \u00b120% respectively)."}
