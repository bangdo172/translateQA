Paper was used extensively in older devices and offers <a0_0><b5_0>relatively high voltage performance<b5_0/><a0_0/>. However, it is susceptible to water absorption, and has been largely replaced by <a1_0><b6_0>plastic film capacitors<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Plastics offer better stability and ageing performance, which makes them useful in <a2_0><b7_0>timer circuits<b7_0/><a2_0/>, although they may be limited to low operating temperatures and frequencies. Ceramic capacitors are generally small, cheap and useful for high frequency applications, although their capacitance varies strongly with voltage and they age poorly. They are broadly categorized as class 1 dielectrics, which have predictable variation of capacitance with temperature or class 2 dielectrics, which can operate at higher voltage. <a3_0><b8_0>Glass<b8_0/><a3_0/> and <a4_0><b9_0>mica capacitors<b9_0/><a4_0/> are extremely reliable, stable and tolerant to high temperatures and voltages, but are too expensive for most mainstream applications. Electrolytic capacitors and supercapacitors are used to store small and larger amounts of energy, respectively, ceramic capacitors are often used in resonators, and parasitic capacitance occurs in circuits wherever the simple conductor-insulator-conductor structure is formed unintentionally by the configuration of the circuit layout."}
