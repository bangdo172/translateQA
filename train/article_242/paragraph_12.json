Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, <a4_0>the dielectric <b9_0>must be thicker<b9_0/><a4_0/>, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as <a3_0><b8_0>the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts<b8_0/><a3_0/>; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy."}
