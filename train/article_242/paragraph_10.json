Changing the plate area and the separation between the plates while maintaining the same volume causes <a1_0>no change of the maximum amount of energy<a1_0/> that the capacitor can store, so long as <b6_0>the distance between plates remains much smaller than both the length and width of the plates<b6_0/>. In addition, these equations assume that the electric field is entirely concentrated in the dielectric between the plates. In reality there are <a2_0><b7_0>fringing fields outside the dielectric<b7_0/><a2_0/>, for example between the sides of the capacitor plates, which <a3_0><b8_0>will increase the effective capacitance<b8_0/><a3_0/> of the capacitor. This is sometimes called parasitic capacitance. For some simple capacitor geometries this additional capacitance term can be calculated analytically. It becomes <a4_0><b9_0>negligibly small<b9_0/><a4_0/> when the ratios of plate width to separation and length to separation are large."}
