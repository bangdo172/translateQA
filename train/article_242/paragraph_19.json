In many vacuum tube circuits, <a2_0><b7_0>interstage coupling capacitors<b7_0/><a2_0/> are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. <a3_0><b8_0>A leaky capacitor<b8_0/><a3_0/> can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can <a4_0><b9_0>cause the plates to glow red<b9_0/><a4_0/>, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production and the use of modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare."}
