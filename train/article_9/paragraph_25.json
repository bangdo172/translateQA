Techniques such as <a3_0>timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties<a3_0/> can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers <a4_0>employed <a0_0>fruit walls<a4_0/><a0_0/> to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls <a5_0>acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm<a5_0/>. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vinters, who use the energy generated by solar panels to <a1_0>power grape presses<a1_0/>."}
