A solar cell is <a3_0>a device that converts light directly into electricity<a3_0/> using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by <a0_0><a4_0>Charles Fritts<a4_0/><a0_0/> in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, <a5_0>Dr Bruno Lange<a5_0/>, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers <a6_0>Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin<a6_0/> created the crystalline silicon solar cell in <a1_0>1954<a1_0/>. These early solar cells cost 286 USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5\u20136%. By 2012 available efficiencies exceed 20% and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics is over 40%."}
