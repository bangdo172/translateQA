The first commercial system was the <a3_0>Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA<a3_0/> where a field of <a0_0>114<a0_0/> parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The <a4_0>use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water<a4_0/> is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. <a5_0>Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks<a5_0/> dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the \"right to dry\" clothes. Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are <a6_0>perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air<a6_0/>. UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 \u00b0C (40 \u00b0F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45\u201360 \u00b0C (113\u2013140 \u00b0F). The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12 years) makes them a <a1_0>more<a1_0/> cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems. As of 2003, over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35,000 square metres (380,000 sq ft) had been installed worldwide, including an 860 m2 (9,300 sq ft) collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1,300 m2 (14,000 sq ft) collector in Coimbatore, India, used for drying marigolds."}
