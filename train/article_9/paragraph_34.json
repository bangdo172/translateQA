With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. <a2_0>Net metering programs<a2_0/> give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled <a3_0>by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes<a3_0/>. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. <a4_0>Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions<a4_0/>, making a second meter unnecessary."}
