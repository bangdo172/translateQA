When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the <a0_0>winter<a0_0/>. Since bare, leafless trees shade <a2_0>1/3 to 1/2<a2_0/> of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator facing side of a building because <a3_0>they will interfere with winter solar availability<a3_0/>. They can, however, be used on the <a4_0>east and west<a4_0/> sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain."}
