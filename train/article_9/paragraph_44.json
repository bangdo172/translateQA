However, the use of <a1_0>photovoltaics<a1_0/> that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because <a2_0>during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for solar panels to absorb<a2_0/>. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day.
