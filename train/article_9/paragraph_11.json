Common thermal mass materials include <a2_0>stone, cement and water<a2_0/>. Historically they have been used in arid <a4_0>climates<a4_0/> or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool <a3_0>by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night<a3_0/>. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for <a5_0>auxiliary heating and cooling equipment<a5_0/>."}
