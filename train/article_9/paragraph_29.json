On <a3_0>29 April 1979<a3_0/>, the Solar Riser made the first flight in a solar-powered, fully controlled, man carrying flying machine, reaching an altitude of <a0_0>40<a0_0/> feet (12 m). In 1980, the Gossamer Penguin made the first piloted flights powered solely by photovoltaics. This was quickly followed by the Solar Challenger which crossed the English Channel in <a4_0>July 1981<a4_0/>. In 1990 Eric Scott Raymond in 21 hops flew from <a5_0>California to North Carolina<a5_0/> using solar power. Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the Pathfinder (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the Helios which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at 29,524 metres (96,864 ft) in 2001. The Zephyr, developed by BAE Systems, is the latest in a line of record-breaking solar aircraft, making a 54-hour flight in 2007, and month-long flights were envisioned by 2010. As of 2015, <a1_0>Solar Impulse<a1_0/>, an electric aircraft, is currently circumnavigating the globe. It is a single-seat plane powered by solar cells and capable of taking off under its own power. The designed allows the aircraft to remain airborne for <a6_0>36 hours<a6_0/>."}
