The higher temperatures are a result of increased absorption of the Solar light by urban materials such as <a3_0>asphalt and concrete<a3_0/>, which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment. A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to <a4_0>paint buildings and roads white and plant trees<a4_0/>. Using these methods, a hypothetical \"cool communities\" program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately <a1_0>3<a1_0/> \u00b0C at an estimated cost of US$1 billion, giving estimated total annual benefits of US$530 million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings."}
