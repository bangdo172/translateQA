They can be grouped into three broad categories: <a3_0>box cookers, panel cookers and reflector cookers<a3_0/>. The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by <a4_0>Horace de Saussure<a4_0/> in <a0_0>1767<a0_0/>. A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid. It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of <a5_0>90\u2013150 \u00b0C (194\u2013302 \u00b0F)<a5_0/>. Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers. Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries (dish, trough, Fresnel mirrors) to focus light on a cooking container. These cookers reach temperatures of <a1_0>315<a1_0/> \u00b0C (599 \u00b0F) and above but require <a6_0>direct light<a6_0/> to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun."}
