The first recorded instance of this was by <a2_0>16th-century Arab alchemists<a2_0/>. A large-scale solar distillation project was first constructed in <a0_0><a3_0>1872<a3_0/><a0_0/> in the Chilean mining town of Las Salinas. The plant, which had solar collection area of 4,700 m2 (51,000 sq ft), could produce up to <a4_0>22,700 L (5,000 imp gal; 6,000 US gal) per day<a4_0/> and operate for 40 years. Individual still designs include <a5_0>single-slope<a5_0/>, double-slope (or greenhouse type), vertical, conical, inverted absorber, multi-wick, and multiple effect. These stills can operate in passive, active, or hybrid modes. Double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes, while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications."}
