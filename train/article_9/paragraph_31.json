Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route <a3_0>uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures<a3_0/> (2,300\u20132,600 \u00b0C or 4,200\u20134,700 \u00b0F). Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods. Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. <a0_0>The <a4_0>Solzinc process<a4_0/><a0_0/> under development at the Weizmann Institute uses a 1 MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide (ZnO) at temperatures above 1,200 \u00b0C (2,200 \u00b0F). This initial reaction produces <a1_0>pure zinc<a1_0/>, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen."}
