When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce <a2_0>well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range<a2_0/>. <a3_0>Socrates' <a0_0>Megaron House<a3_0/><a0_0/> is a classic example of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as <a4_0>pumps, fans and switchable windows<a4_0/> can complement passive design and improve system performance."}
