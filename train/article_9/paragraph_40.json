Active solar techniques include the use of <a1_0>photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating<a1_0/> to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include <a2_0>orienting a building to the Sun<a2_0/>, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air."}
