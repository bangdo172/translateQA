In the first instance, Dell offered a <a2_0><b7_0>19\" LCD<b7_0/><a2_0/> panel for $15. In the second instance, Dell offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), <a1_0><b6_0>70%<b6_0/><a1_0/> lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1900). Concerning the E4300, rather than honour the discount taking a significant loss, the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) a customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell <a3_0><b8_0>NT$1 million<b8_0/><a3_0/> (US$31250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price. The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as the prestigious firm said the company mispriced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks."}
