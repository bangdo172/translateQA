Dell closed plants that produced desktop computers for the North American market, including the <a1_0><b6_0>Mort Topfer Manufacturing Center<b6_0/><a1_0/> in Austin, Texas (original location) and Lebanon, Tennessee (opened in 1999) in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The desktop production plant in Winston-Salem, <a2_0><b7_0>North Carolina<b7_0/><a2_0/>, received US$280 million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010. Dell's contract with the state required them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions, and they sold the North Carolina plant to <a3_0><b8_0>Herbalife<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas. The Miami, <a4_0><b9_0>Florida<b9_0/><a4_0/>, facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas. On January 8, 2009, Dell announced the closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland, with the loss of 1,900 jobs and the transfer of production to its plant in \u0141od\u017a in Poland."}
