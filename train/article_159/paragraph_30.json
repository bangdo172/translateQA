Dell's own <a1_0><b6_0>mobility<b6_0/><a1_0/> division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets, whether running Windows or Google Android. The Dell <a2_0><b7_0>Streak<b7_0/><a2_0/> was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated OS, numerous bugs, and low resolution screen. InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers. Dell has responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the <a3_0><b8_0>XPS<b8_0/><a3_0/> line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets. The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to an operating loss in Q3 2012. In December <a4_0><b9_0>2012<b9_0/><a4_0/>, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8."}
