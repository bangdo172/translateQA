The original Dell model was known for high customer satisfaction when PCs sold for thousands but by the 2000s, the company could not justify that level of service when computers in the same lineup sold for hundreds. Rollins responded by shifting <a2_0><b7_0>Dick Hunter<b7_0/><a2_0/> from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting \"got in the way,\" aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent <a3_0><b8_0>$100 million<b8_0/><a3_0/> in just a few months to improve on this, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional \"bloatware\" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the \"Dell Hell\" prominent on Internet search engines."}
