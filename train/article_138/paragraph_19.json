The system is used in the US for elite level competition. Unlike the old code of points, there are two separate scores, <a1_0>an <b6_0>execution score<b6_0/> and a <a2_0>difficulty score<a2_0/><a1_0/>. In the previous system, the \"execution score\" was the only score. It was and still is out of 10.00. During the gymnast's performance, the judges deduct this score only. A fall, on or off the event, is <b8_0>a <a3_0>1.00<b8_0/> deduction<a3_0/>, in elite level gymnastics. The introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change. The gymnast's difficulty score is based on <a4_0><b9_0>what elements they perform<b9_0/><a4_0/> and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. <b7_0>Connection bonuses<b7_0/> are the most common deduction from a difficulty score, as it can be difficult to connect multiple flight elements. It is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly. The new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of the skills they perform as well as their execution. There is no maximum score for difficulty, as it can keep increasing as the difficulty of the skills increase."}
