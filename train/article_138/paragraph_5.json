Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on <a2_0><b5_0>their height and strength<b5_0/><a2_0/>. The post flight segment may include one or more <b6_0>multiple saltos or somersaults, and/or twisting movements<b6_0/>. A round-off entry vault, called <b7_0>a <a3_0><b9_0>Yurchenko<b9_0/><b7_0/><a3_0/>, is the most common vault in elite level gymnastics. When performing a <a4_0>yurchenko<a4_0/>, gymnasts \"round-off\" so hands are on the runway while the feet land on the springboard (beatboard). From the roundoff position the gymnast travels backwards and executes a backhandspring so that the hands land on the vaulting table. The gymnast then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and/or somersaulting combinations. The post flight segment brings the gymnast to her feet."}
