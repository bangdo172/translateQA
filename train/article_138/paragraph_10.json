The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. <b8_0>To make the exercise more challenging<b8_0/>, gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles) or by straddling their legs (Flares).
