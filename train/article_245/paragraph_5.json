The ice of a polar glacier is <a3_0>always below <b5_0>freezing point<b5_0/> from the surface to its base<a3_0/>, although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting. A sub-polar glacier includes both <b7_0>temperate and polar ice<b7_0/>, depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length of the glacier. In a similar way, the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by the temperature at its <a0_0>base alone<a0_0/>. A cold-based glacier is below freezing at the ice-ground interface, and is thus <b9_0>frozen to the underlying substrate<b9_0/>. A <a1_0>warm-based glacier<a1_0/> is <b8_0>above or at freezing at the interface<b8_0/>, and is able to slide at this contact. This contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively erode its bed, as sliding ice promotes plucking at rock from the surface below. Glaciers which are <a2_0>partly cold-based and partly warm-based<a2_0/> are known as polythermal."}
