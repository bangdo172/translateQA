This snow collects and is compacted by the weight of the snow falling above it forming n\u00e9v\u00e9. Further crushing of the individual snowflakes and squeezing the air from the snow turns it into 'glacial ice'. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it 'overflows' through a geological weakness or vacancy, such as the gap between two mountains.
