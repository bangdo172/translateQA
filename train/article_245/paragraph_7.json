The <a1_0>ablation zone<a1_0/> is the region where there is a net loss in glacier mass. The <a2_0><b5_0>equilibrium line<b5_0/><a2_0/> separates the ablation zone and the accumulation zone; it is the altitude where the amount of new snow gained by accumulation is equal to the amount of ice lost through ablation. The upper part of a glacier, where accumulation exceeds ablation, is called the accumulation zone. In general, the accumulation zone accounts for <a3_0>60\u201370%<a3_0/> of <b6_0>the glacier's surface area<b6_0/>, more if the glacier calves icebergs. Ice in the accumulation zone is deep enough to exert a <b7_0>downward force<b7_0/> that erodes underlying rock. After a glacier melts, it often leaves behind a bowl- or amphitheater-shaped depression that ranges in size from large basins like the <b8_0>Great Lakes<b8_0/> to smaller mountain depressions known as cirques."}
