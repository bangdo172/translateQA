Two glacial cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow ridge, called an <a2_0>ar\u00eate<a2_0/> is left. This structure may result in a <b6_0>mountain pass<b6_0/>. If multiple cirques encircle a single mountain, they create pointed pyramidal peaks; particularly steep examples are called <a3_0><b7_0>horns<b7_0/><a3_0/>."}
