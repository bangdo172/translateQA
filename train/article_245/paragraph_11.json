These glaciers exhibit normal movement until suddenly they accelerate, then return to their previous state. During these <b4_0><b5_0>surges<b5_0/><b4_0/>, the glacier may reach velocities far greater than normal speed. These surges may be caused by <a1_0>failure of the underlying bedrock<a1_0/>, the pooling of meltwater at the base of the glacier \u2014 perhaps delivered from a supraglacial lake \u2014 or the simple accumulation of mass beyond a critical \"tipping point\". Temporary rates up to <a2_0>90 m (300 ft) per day<a2_0/> have occurred when increased temperature or overlying pressure caused bottom ice to melt and water to accumulate beneath a glacier."}
