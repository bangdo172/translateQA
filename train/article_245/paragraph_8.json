When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, <b7_0>cracks called crevasses<b7_0/> develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to <a2_0>differences in glacier velocity<a2_0/>. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, <b8_0>shear forces cause them to break apart<b8_0/>, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than <a4_0><b9_0>46 m (150 ft)<a4_0/> deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft)<b9_0/> or even deeper.
