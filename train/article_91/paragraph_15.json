It began gradually, but by the late 540s <a0_0>Slavic tribes<a0_0/> were in Thrace and Illyrium, and had defeated an imperial army near Adrianople in 551. In the 560s <a1_0>the Avars<a1_0/> began to expand from their base on the north bank of <a2_0>the Danube<a2_0/>; by the end of the 6th century they were the dominant power in Central Europe and routinely able to force the eastern emperors to pay tribute. They remained a strong power until 796. An additional problem to face the empire came as a result of the involvement of Emperor Maurice (r. 582\u2013<a4_0>602<a4_0/>) in Persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute. This led to a period of peace, but when Maurice was overthrown, the Persians invaded and during the reign of Emperor <a3_0>Heraclius<a3_0/> (r. 610\u2013641) controlled large chunks of the empire, including Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor, until Heraclius' successful counterattack. In 628 the empire secured a peace treaty and recovered all of its lost territories."}
