John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an <a0_0>English<a0_0/> theologian, was condemned as a heretic in <a1_0>1415<a1_0/> for teaching that <a2_0>the laity<a2_0/> should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and <a3_0>Hussitism<a3_0/> in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was <a4_0>burned at the stake<a4_0/> in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285\u20131314) and the Hospitallers."}
