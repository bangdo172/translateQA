Many of the popes prior to 750 were more concerned with Byzantine affairs and eastern theological controversies. The register, or archived copies of the letters, of Pope Gregory the Great (pope <a0_0>590<a0_0/>\u2013604) survived, and of those more than <a1_0>850<a1_0/> letters, the vast majority were concerned with affairs in Italy or Constantinople. The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was <a2_0>Britain<a2_0/>, where Gregory had sent the Gregorian mission in <a3_0>597<a3_0/> to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. Irish missionaries were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries, going first to England and Scotland and then on to the continent. Under such monks as Columba (d. 597) and Columbanus (d. <a4_0>615<a4_0/>), they founded monasteries, taught in Latin and Greek, and authored secular and religious works."}
