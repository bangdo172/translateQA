Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, Jerome (d. <a1_0>420<a1_0/>) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading <a0_0>Cicero<a0_0/> than the Bible. By the <a2_0>6th<a2_0/> century, Gregory of Tours (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning shorthand. By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become <a3_0>music<a3_0/> and art rather than the book. Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some original works were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris (d. <a4_0>489<a4_0/>), Cassiodorus (d. c. 585), and Boethius (d. c. 525) were typical of the age."}
