Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned, as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas. Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in <a2_0>Eastern<a2_0/> Europe, as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free. Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into <a3_0>cash rents<a3_0/>. The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of <a1_0>90<a1_0/> to closer to <a0_0>50<a0_0/> per cent by the end of the period. Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders, and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments. Partly at the urging of landlords, governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death. Non-clergy became increasingly literate, and urban populations began to imitate the nobility's interest in <a4_0>chivalry<a4_0/>."}
