African goods stopped being imported into Europe, first disappearing from the interior and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as <a0_0>Rome<a0_0/> or Naples. By the end of the 7th century, under the impact of the <a1_0>Muslim conquests<a1_0/>, African products were no longer found in Western Europe. The replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands that happened in the Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually <a2_0>luxury goods<a2_0/>. In the northern parts of Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but the goods carried were simple, with little pottery or other complex products. Around the Mediterranean, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks, not just produced locally."}
