The Ostrogoths settled in Italy in the late <a0_0>5th<a0_0/> century under <a1_0>Theoderic<a1_0/> (d. 526) and set up a kingdom marked by its co-operation between the Italians and the Ostrogoths, at least until the last years of Theodoric's reign. The Burgundians settled in <a3_0>Gaul<a3_0/>, and after an earlier realm was destroyed by <a2_0>the Huns<a2_0/> in 436 formed a new kingdom in the 440s. Between today's Geneva and Lyon, it grew to become the realm of Burgundy in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. In northern Gaul, the Franks and Britons set up small polities. The Frankish Kingdom was centred in north-eastern Gaul, and the first king of whom much is known is <a4_0>Childeric<a4_0/> (d. 481).[G] Under Childeric's son Clovis (r. 509\u2013511), the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity. Britons, related to the natives of Britannia \u2014 modern-day Great Britain \u2014 settled in what is now Brittany.[H] Other monarchies were established by the Visigoths in Iberia, the Suevi in north-western Iberia, and the Vandals in North Africa. In the 6th century, the Lombards settled in northern Italy, replacing the Ostrogothic kingdom with a grouping of duchies that occasionally selected a king to rule over them all. By the late 6th century this arrangement had been replaced by a permanent monarchy."}
