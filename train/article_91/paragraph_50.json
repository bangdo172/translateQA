Southern Iberia remained under control of Islamic states, initially under <a3_0>the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba<a3_0/>, which broke up in 1031 into a shifting number of petty states known as taifas, who fought with the Christians until <a4_0>the Almohad Caliphate<a4_0/> re-established centralised rule over Southern Iberia in the 1170s. Christian forces advanced again in the early 13th century, culminating in the capture of Seville in 1248."}
