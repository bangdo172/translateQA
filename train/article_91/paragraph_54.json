The Spanish crusades became fused with the Reconquista of Spain from the Muslims. Although the Templars and Hospitallers took part in the Spanish crusades, similar Spanish military religious orders were founded, most of which had become part of the two main orders of Calatrava and Santiago by the beginning of the 12th century. Northern Europe also remained outside Christian influence until the 11th century or later, and became a crusading venue as part of the Northern Crusades of the <a3_0>12th<a3_0/> to <a4_0>14th<a4_0/> centuries. These crusades also spawned a military order, <a2_0>the Order of the Sword Brothers<a2_0/>. Another order, the Teutonic Knights, although originally founded in the crusader states, focused much of its activity in the Baltic after 1225, and in 1309 moved its headquarters to <a1_0>Marienburg<a1_0/> in Prussia."}
