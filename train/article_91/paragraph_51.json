In <a1_0>1071<a1_0/>, the Turkish army defeated the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert and captured the <a2_0>Byzantine Emperor Romanus IV<a2_0/> (r. 1068\u201371). The Turks were then free to invade Asia Minor, which dealt a dangerous blow to the Byzantine Empire by seizing a large part of its population and its economic heartland. Although the Byzantines regrouped and recovered somewhat, they never fully regained Asia Minor and were often on the defensive. The Turks also had difficulties, losing control of Jerusalem to <a3_0>the Fatimids of Egypt<a3_0/> and suffering from a series of internal civil wars. The Byzantines also faced a revived Bulgaria, which in the late 12th and 13th centuries spread throughout the Balkans."}
