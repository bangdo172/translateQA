In addition, the spinning wheel replaced <a0_0>the traditional distaff<a0_0/> for spinning wool, tripling production.[AI] A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily life was the use of <a1_0>buttons<a1_0/> as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined with the creation of <a2_0>the tower mill<a2_0/>, allowing the upper part of the windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing. The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in <a3_0>Sweden<a3_0/>, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. The first patent law in 1447 in <a4_0>Venice<a4_0/> protected the rights of inventors to their inventions."}
