Further east, the kingdoms of Poland, Hungary, and <a0_0>Bohemia<a0_0/> grew powerful. In Iberia, the Christian kingdoms continued to gain land from the Muslim kingdoms of the peninsula; Portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the <a1_0>15th<a1_0/> century, while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns. After losing the Hundred Years' War, <a2_0>England<a2_0/> went on to suffer a long civil war known as the Wars of the Roses, which lasted into the 1490s and only ended when Henry Tudor (r. 1485\u20131509 as <a3_0>Henry VII<a3_0/>) became king and consolidated power with his victory over Richard III (r. 1483\u201385) at Bosworth in 1485.
