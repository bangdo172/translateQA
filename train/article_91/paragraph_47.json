Kings in France, <a3_0>England<a3_0/>, and Spain consolidated their power, and set up lasting governing institutions.

The papacy, long attached to an ideology of independence from secular kings, first asserted its claim to temporal authority over the entire Christian world; the Papal Monarchy reached its apogee in the early 13th century under the pontificate of Innocent III (pope <a2_0>1198<a2_0/>\u20131216). Northern Crusades and the advance of Christian kingdoms and military orders into previously pagan regions in the Baltic and Finnic north-east brought the forced assimilation of numerous native peoples into European culture."}
