Northern Europe and Spain continued to use Gothic styles, which became increasingly elaborate in the 15th century, until almost the end of the period. International Gothic was a courtly style that reached much of Europe in the decades around <a0_0>1400<a0_0/>, producing masterpieces such as <a1_0>the Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry<a1_0/>. All over Europe secular art continued to increase in quantity and quality, and in the 15th century the mercantile classes of Italy and Flanders became important patrons, commissioning small portraits of themselves in oils as well as a growing range of luxury items such as jewellery, ivory caskets, cassone chests, and maiolica pottery. These objects also included the Hispano-Moresque ware produced by mostly <a3_0>Mud\u00e9jar potters<a3_0/> in Spain. Although royalty owned huge collections of plate, little survives except for <a4_0>the Royal Gold Cup<a4_0/>. Italian silk manufacture developed, so that western churches and elites no longer needed to rely on imports from Byzantium or the Islamic world. In France and Flanders tapestry weaving of sets like The Lady and the Unicorn became a major luxury industry."}
