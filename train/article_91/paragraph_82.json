Their efforts undermined the prevailing Platonic idea of \"<a4_0>universals<a4_0/>\". Ockham's insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy. Legal studies were marked by the steady advance of Roman law into areas of jurisprudence previously governed by <a1_0>customary law<a1_0/>. The lone exception to this trend was in <a2_0>England<a2_0/>, where the common law remained pre-eminent.
