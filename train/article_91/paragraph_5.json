When referring to their own times, they spoke of them as being \"modern\". In the 1330s, the humanist and poet <a1_0>Petrarch<a1_0/> referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (or \"ancient\") and to the Christian period as nova (or \"new\"). <a2_0>Leonardo Bruni<a2_0/> was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his History of the Florentine People (<a3_0>1442<a3_0/>). Bruni and later historians argued that Italy had recovered since Petrarch's time, and therefore added a third period to Petrarch's two. The \"Middle Ages\" first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas or \"middle season\". In early usage, there were many variants, including medium aevum, or \"middle age\", first recorded in 1604, and media saecula, or \"middle ages\", first recorded in 1625. The alternative term \"medieval\" (or occasionally \"mediaeval\") derives from medium aevum. Tripartite periodisation became standard after the German 17th century historian <a4_0>Christoph Cellarius<a4_0/> divided history into three periods: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern."}
