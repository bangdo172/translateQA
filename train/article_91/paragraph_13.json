The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages. The Latin of the Western Roman Empire was gradually replaced by languages based on, but distinct from, Latin, collectively known as <a2_0>Romance languages<a2_0/>. These changes from Latin to the new languages took many centuries. <a3_0>Greek<a3_0/> remained the language of the Byzantine Empire, but the migrations of the Slavs added <a4_0>Slavonic<a4_0/> languages to Eastern Europe."}
