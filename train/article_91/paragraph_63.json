Where available, Roman brick and stone buildings were recycled for their materials. From the tentative beginnings known as the First Romanesque, the style flourished and spread across Europe in a remarkably homogeneous form. Just before <a4_0>1000<a4_0/> there was a great wave of building stone churches all over Europe. Romanesque buildings have massive stone walls, openings topped by semi-circular arches, small windows, and, particularly in France, <a1_0>arched stone vaults<a1_0/>. The large portal with coloured sculpture in high relief became a central feature of fa\u00e7ades, especially in France, and the capitals of columns were often carved with narrative scenes of imaginative monsters and animals. According to art historian <a2_0>C. R. Dodwell<a2_0/>, \"virtually all the churches in the West were decorated with wall-paintings\", of which few survive. Simultaneous with the development in church architecture, the distinctive European form of <a3_0>the castle<a3_0/> was developed, and became crucial to politics and warfare."}
