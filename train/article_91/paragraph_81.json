This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued the practices of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief in the power of the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas \u00e0 Kempis (d. <a1_0>1471<a1_0/>) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in <a2_0>1484<a2_0/> and the publication in <a3_0>1486<a3_0/> of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular <a4_0>handbook for witch-hunters<a4_0/>."}
