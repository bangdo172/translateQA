The barbarian invaders, including various Germanic peoples, formed new kingdoms in what remained of <a1_0>the Western Roman Empire<a1_0/>. In the <a3_0>7th<a3_0/> century, North Africa and the Middle East\u2014once part of <a2_0>the Eastern Roman Empire<a2_0/>\u2014came under the rule of the Caliphate, an Islamic empire, after conquest by Muhammad's successors. Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break with Antiquity was not complete. The still-sizeable Byzantine Empire survived in the east and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the Code of Justinian, was rediscovered in Northern Italy in <a4_0>1070<a4_0/> and became widely admired later in the Middle Ages. In the West, most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions. Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise pagan Europe continued. The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, briefly established the Carolingian Empire during the later 8th and early 9th century. It covered much of Western Europe, but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars combined with external invasions\u2014Vikings from the north, Magyars from the east, and Saracens from the south."}
