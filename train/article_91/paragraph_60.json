The development of <a3_0>the heavy plough<a3_0/> allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by the spread of <a2_0>the horse collar<a2_0/>, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are <a4_0>faster<a4_0/> than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system."}
