Judaism was an active proselytising faith, and at least one <a0_0>Arab<a0_0/> political leader converted to it.[J] Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians' <a1_0>Zoroastrianism<a1_0/> in seeking converts, especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula. All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad (d. <a2_0>632<a2_0/>). After his death, Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia, starting with Syria in <a3_0>634\u2013635<a3_0/> and reaching Egypt in 640\u2013641, Persia between 637 and 642, North Africa in the later <a4_0>7th<a4_0/> century, and the Iberian Peninsula in 711. By 714, Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called Al-Andalus."}
