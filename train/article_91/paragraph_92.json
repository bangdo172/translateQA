One misconception, first propagated in the <a0_0>19th<a0_0/> century and still very common, is that all people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat. This is untrue, as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere. Lindberg and <a4_0>Ronald Numbers<a4_0/>, another scholar of the period, state that there \"was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference\". Other misconceptions such as \"the Church prohibited autopsies and <a1_0>dissections<a1_0/> during the Middle Ages\", \"the rise of Christianity killed off <a2_0>ancient science<a2_0/>\", or \"the medieval Christian church suppressed the growth of <a3_0>natural philosophy<a3_0/>\", are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by current historical research."}
