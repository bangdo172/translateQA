Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The <a2_0>English<a2_0/> monk Alcuin (d. <a3_0>804<a3_0/>) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's chancery\u2014or writing office\u2014made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule,[M] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced. Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called <a4_0>Medieval Latin<a4_0/>."}
