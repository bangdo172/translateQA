The estimated population of Europe grew from <a1_0>35<a1_0/> to <a0_0>80 million<a0_0/> between 1000 and 1347, although the exact causes remain unclear: improved agricultural techniques, the decline of slaveholding, a more clement climate and the lack of invasion have all been suggested. As much as <a2_0>90<a2_0/> per cent of the European population remained rural peasants. Many were no longer settled in isolated farms but had gathered into small communities, usually known as manors or <a3_0>villages<a3_0/>. These peasants were often subject to noble overlords and owed them rents and other services, in a system known as manorialism. There remained a few free peasants throughout this period and beyond, with more of them in the regions of Southern Europe than in the north. The practice of <a4_0>assarting<a4_0/>, or bringing new lands into production by offering incentives to the peasants who settled them, also contributed to the expansion of population."}
