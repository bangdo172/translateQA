In 1024, they were replaced by the <a1_0>Salian<a1_0/> dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. <a2_0>1084<a2_0/>\u20131105) over church appointments as part of the <a3_0>Investiture Controversy<a3_0/>. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111\u201325), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155\u201390) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson <a4_0>Frederick II<a4_0/> (r. 1220\u20131250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287."}
