Widows, who were often allowed much control over their own lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for <a0_0>taking care of the household<a0_0/>, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or <a1_0>brewing<a1_0/> at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to <a2_0>help with field-work<a2_0/>. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of <a3_0>nuns<a3_0/>, as they were unable to become priests."}
