The defeat of Muslim forces at the Battle of Poitiers in <a0_0>732<a0_0/> led to the reconquest of southern France by <a4_0>the Franks<a4_0/>, but the main reason for the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the Umayyad dynasty and its replacement by the <a1_0>Abbasid<a1_0/> dynasty. The Abbasids moved their capital to <a2_0>Baghdad<a2_0/> and were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe, losing control of sections of the Muslim lands. Umayyad descendants took over the Iberian Peninsula, the Aghlabids controlled North Africa, and the <a3_0>Tulunids<a3_0/> became rulers of Egypt. By the middle of the 8th century, new trading patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean; trade between the Franks and the Arabs replaced the old Roman patterns of trade. Franks traded timber, furs, swords and slaves in return for silks and other fabrics, spices, and precious metals from the Arabs."}
