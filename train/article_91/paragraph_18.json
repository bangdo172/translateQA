Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from <a4_0>archaeology<a4_0/>; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the <a2_0>9th<a2_0/> century. Most the descriptions of the lower classes come from either <a3_0>law codes<a3_0/> or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed for a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as <a0_0>700<a0_0/> inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through <a1_0>military service<a1_0/> to a powerful lord."}
