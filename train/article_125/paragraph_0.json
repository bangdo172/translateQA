Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding <b5_0>cracks in the fuselage<b5_0/>, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline. This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly <a1_0>46<a1_0/> airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in <b8_0>two<b8_0/> airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. <a3_0>Jim Oberstar<a3_0/>, former chairman of the committee said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing <a4_0><b6_0>117<b6_0/><a4_0/> aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a \"culture of coziness\" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and \"a systematic breakdown\" in the FAA's culture that resulted in \"malfeasance, bordering on corruption.\" In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest <a2_0>$10.2 million<a2_0/> for failing to inspect older planes for cracks, and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a <b7_0>$7.5 million<b7_0/> penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through."}
