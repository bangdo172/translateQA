Rather than commend the agency for proposing a <a3_0>$10.2 million<a3_0/> fine against Southwest Airlines for its failure to conduct mandatory inspections in <b5_0><b8_0>2008<b8_0/><b5_0/>, he was quoted as saying the following in an Associated Press story: \"Penalties against airlines that violate FAA directives should be stiffer. At <a1_0>$25,000<a1_0/> per violation, Gutheinz said, airlines can justify rolling the dice and taking the chance on getting caught. He also said the FAA is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots.\" Other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the FAA is expected to operate. The dual role of encouraging aerospace travel and regulating aerospace travel are contradictory. For example, to <b7_0>levy a heavy penalty<b7_0/> upon an airline for violating an FAA regulation which would <a2_0>impact their ability to continue operating<a2_0/> would not be considered encouraging aerospace travel."}
