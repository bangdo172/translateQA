This system required enhancement to keep pace with air traffic growth, however, especially after the <b7_0>Airline Deregulation Act of <a1_0><b6_0>1978<b7_0/><b6_0/><a1_0/> phased out the CAB's economic regulation of the airlines. A nationwide strike by the air traffic controllers union in <a2_0><b8_0>1981<b8_0/><a2_0/> forced temporary flight restrictions but failed to shut down the airspace system. During the following year, the agency unveiled a new plan for further automating its air traffic control facilities, but progress proved disappointing. In <a3_0>1994<a3_0/>, the FAA shifted to a more step-by-step approach that has provided controllers with advanced equipment."}
