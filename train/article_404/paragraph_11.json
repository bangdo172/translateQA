Because LEDs produce less waste heat than <a2_0><b6_0>incandescent lamps<b6_0/><a2_0/>, their use in freezers can save on refrigeration costs as well. However, they may be more susceptible to <a3_0><b7_0>frost<b7_0/><a3_0/> and snow buildup than incandescent lamps, so some LED lighting systems have been designed with an added heating circuit. Additionally, research has developed heat sink technologies that will transfer heat produced within the junction to appropriate areas of the light fixture."}
