As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the <a1_0><b6_0>YAG phosphor<b6_0/><a1_0/>, with <a2_0><b7_0>less than 10%<b7_0/><a2_0/> Stoke shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and <a3_0><b8_0>higher operation temperatures<b8_0/><a3_0/>. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by <a4_0><b9_0>adapting better package design<b9_0/><a4_0/> or by using a more suitable type of phosphor. Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness."}
