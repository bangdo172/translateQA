This avoids the typical <a2_0><b7_0>costly sapphire substrate<b7_0/><a2_0/> in relatively small 100- or 150-mm wafer sizes. The sapphire apparatus must be coupled with a <a3_0><b8_0>mirror-like collector<b8_0/><a3_0/> to reflect light that would otherwise be wasted. It is predicted that by <a4_0>2020<a4_0/>, 40% of all GaN LEDs will be made with GaN-on-Si. Manufacturing large sapphire material is difficult, while large silicon material is cheaper and more abundant. LED companies shifting from using sapphire to silicon should be a minimal investment."}
