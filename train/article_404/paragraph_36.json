The use in brakes improves safety, due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully, or faster rise time, up to <a2_0><b7_0>0.5 second<b7_0/><a2_0/> faster[citation needed] than an incandescent bulb. This gives drivers behind more time to react. In a dual intensity circuit (rear markers and brakes) if the LEDs are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency, they can create a phantom array, where <b8_0>ghost<b8_0/> images of the LED will appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array. <a3_0>White<a3_0/> LED headlamps are starting to be used. Using LEDs has styling advantages because LEDs can form much <a4_0>thinner<a4_0/> lights than incandescent lamps with parabolic reflectors."}
