Several key factors that play among these different methods, include color stability, color rendering capability, and <a1_0><b6_0>luminous efficacy<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Often, higher efficiency will mean <a2_0>lower color rendering<a2_0/>, presenting a trade-off between the luminous efficacy and color rendering. For example, the <a3_0><b8_0>dichromatic white LEDs<b8_0/><a3_0/> have the best luminous efficacy (120 lm/W), but the <b7_0>lowest color rendering<b7_0/> capability. However, although tetrachromatic white LEDs have excellent color rendering capability, they often have poor luminous efficacy. Trichromatic white LEDs are in between, having both good luminous efficacy (<a4_0><b9_0>>70 lm/W<b9_0/><a4_0/>) and fair color rendering capability."}
