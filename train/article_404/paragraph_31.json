These are being used as <a1_0>a <b6_0>low cost decorative alternative<b6_0/> for traditional light bulbs<a1_0/> that are being phased out in many countries. The filaments require a rather <a2_0><b7_0>high<b7_0/><a2_0/> voltage to light to nominal brightness, allowing them to work efficiently and simply with mains voltages. Often <a3_0>a <b8_0>simple rectifier<b8_0/><a3_0/> and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low-cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of creating a low voltage, <a4_0>high current converter<a4_0/> which is required by single die LEDs. Usually they are packaged in a sealed enclosure with a shape similar to lamps they were designed to replace (e.g. a bulb), and filled with inert nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas to remove heat efficiently."}
