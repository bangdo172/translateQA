Their emission color can be tuned from the visible throughout the infrared spectrum. This allows <b4_0>quantum dot<b4_0/> LEDs to <a1_0><b5_0>create almost any color on the CIE diagram<b5_0/><a1_0/>. This provides more color options and <a2_0><b6_0>better color rendering<b6_0/><a2_0/> than white LEDs since the emission spectrum is much narrower, characteristic of quantum confined states. There are <a3_0><b7_0>two<b7_0/><a3_0/> types of schemes for QD excitation. One uses photo excitation with a primary light source LED (typically blue or UV LEDs are used). The other is direct electrical excitation first demonstrated by Alivisatos et al."}
