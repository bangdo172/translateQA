For each half-cycle, part of the LED emits light and part is dark, and this is reversed during the next half-cycle. The efficacy of this type of HP-LED is typically <a1_0><b6_0>40 lm/W<b6_0/><a1_0/>. A large number of LED elements in series may be able to operate directly from line voltage. In <a2_0><b7_0>2009<b7_0/><a2_0/>, Seoul Semiconductor released a high DC voltage LED, named as '<a4_0>Acrich MJT<a4_0/>', capable of being driven from AC power with a simple controlling circuit. The low-power dissipation of these LEDs affords them <a3_0>more <b8_0>flexibility<b8_0/><a3_0/> than the original AC LED design."}
