With the development of high-power LEDs the devices are subjected to <a3_0><b8_0>higher junction temperatures<b8_0/><a3_0/> and higher current densities than traditional devices. This causes stress on the material and may cause early light-output degradation. To quantitatively classify useful lifetime in a standardized manner it has been suggested to use <a4_0><b9_0>L70 or L50<b9_0/><a4_0/>, which are the runtimes (typically given in thousands of hours) at which a given LED reaches 70% and 50% of initial light output, respectively."}
