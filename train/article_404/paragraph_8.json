The same process is reversed here (i.e. the P-N junction emits light when electrical energy is applied to it). This phenomenon is generally called <a1_0><b6_0>electroluminescence<b6_0/><a1_0/>, which can be defined as the emission of light from a semi-conductor under the influence of an electric field. The charge carriers recombine in a forward-biased P-N junction as the electrons cross from the N-region and recombine with the <a3_0><b8_0>holes existing in the P-region<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Free electrons are in <a2_0>the <b7_0>conduction band<b7_0/><a2_0/> of energy levels, while holes are in the valence energy band. Thus the energy level of the holes will be lesser than the energy levels of the electrons. Some portion of the energy must be dissipated in order <a4_0>to <b9_0>recombine the electrons and the holes<b9_0/><a4_0/>. This energy is emitted in the form of heat and light."}
