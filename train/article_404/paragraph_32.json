This means that <a1_0>a <b6_0>small change in voltage<b6_0/><a1_0/> can cause a large change in current. If the applied voltage exceeds the LED's forward voltage drop by a small amount, the current rating may be exceeded by a large amount, potentially damaging or destroying the LED. The typical solution is to <a2_0>use <b7_0>constant-current power supplies<b7_0/><a2_0/> to keep the current below the LED's maximum current rating. Since most common power sources (<a4_0>batteries<a4_0/>, mains) are constant-voltage sources, most LED fixtures must include <a3_0>a <b8_0>power converter<b8_0/><a3_0/>, at least a current-limiting resistor. However, the high resistance of three-volt coin cells combined with the high differential resistance of nitride-based LEDs makes it possible to power such an LED from such a coin cell without an external resistor."}
