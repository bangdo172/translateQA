In this device a Y\n3Al\n5O\n12:Ce (known as \"YAG\") phosphor coating on the emitter absorbs some of the blue emission and produces <a1_0><b3_0>yellow light<b3_0/><a1_0/> through fluorescence. The combination of that yellow with remaining blue light appears white to the eye. However using different phosphors (fluorescent materials) it also became possible to instead produce green and red light through fluorescence. The resulting mixture of red, green and blue is not only perceived by humans as white light but is superior for illumination in terms of color rendering, whereas one cannot appreciate the color of red or green objects illuminated only by the yellow (and remaining blue) wavelengths from the YAG phosphor."}
