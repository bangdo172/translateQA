Hence the method is called <a1_0><b5_0>multi-color white LEDs<b5_0/><a1_0/> (sometimes referred to as <a3_0><b7_0>RGB LEDs<b7_0/><a3_0/>). Because these need <a2_0><b6_0>electronic circuits<b6_0/><a2_0/> to control the blending and diffusion of different colors, and because the individual color LEDs typically have slightly different emission patterns (leading to variation of the color depending on direction) even if they are made as a single unit, these are seldom used to produce white lighting. Nonetheless, this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors, and in principle, this mechanism also has higher quantum efficiency in producing white light.[citation needed]"}
