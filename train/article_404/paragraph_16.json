Near-UV emitters at wavelengths around <a2_0><b7_0>375\u2013395 nm<b7_0/><a2_0/> are already cheap and often encountered, for example, as black light lamp replacements for inspection of anti-counterfeiting UV watermarks in some documents and paper currencies. Shorter-wavelength diodes, while substantially more expensive, are commercially available for wavelengths down to <a3_0><b8_0>240 nm<b8_0/><a3_0/>. As the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of DNA, with a peak at about 260 nm, UV LED emitting at <a4_0><b9_0>250\u2013270 nm<b9_0/><a4_0/> are to be expected in prospective disinfection and sterilization devices. Recent research has shown that commercially available UVA LEDs (365 nm) are already effective disinfection and sterilization devices. UV-C wavelengths were obtained in laboratories using aluminium nitride (210 nm), boron nitride (215 nm) and diamond (235 nm)."}
