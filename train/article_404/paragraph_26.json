A layer of quantum dots is sandwiched between layers of electron-transporting and <a1_0><b5_0>hole-transporting materials<b5_0/><a1_0/>. An applied electric field causes <a2_0><b6_0>electrons and holes<b6_0/><a2_0/> to move into the quantum dot layer and recombine forming an exciton that excites a QD. This scheme is commonly studied for quantum dot display. The tunability of emission wavelengths and narrow bandwidth is also beneficial as excitation sources for fluorescence imaging.
