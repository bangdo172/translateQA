Biard and Gary Pittman discovered near-infrared (900 nm) light emission from a <a1_0><b6_0>tunnel<b6_0/><a1_0/> diode they had constructed on a GaAs substrate. By October 1961, they had demonstrated efficient light emission and signal coupling between a GaAs p-n junction light emitter and an electrically-isolated semiconductor photodetector. On August 8, <a2_0><b7_0>1962<b7_0/><a2_0/>, Biard and Pittman filed a patent titled \"Semiconductor Radiant Diode\" based on their findings, which described a zinc diffused p\u2013n junction LED with a spaced cathode contact to allow for efficient emission of infrared light under forward bias. After establishing the priority of their work based on engineering notebooks predating submissions from G.E. Labs, RCA Research Labs, IBM Research Labs, Bell Labs, and Lincoln Lab at MIT, the U.S. patent office issued the two inventors the patent for the <a3_0><b8_0>GaAs infrared<b8_0/> (IR) light-emitting diode<a3_0/> (U.S. Patent US3293513), the first practical LED. Immediately after filing the patent, <a4_0>Texas Instruments (TI)<a4_0/> began a project to manufacture infrared diodes. In October 1962, TI announced the first LED commercial product (the SNX-100), which employed a pure GaAs crystal to emit a 890 nm light output. In October 1963, TI announced the first commercial hemispherical LED, the SNX-110."}
