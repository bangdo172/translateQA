Building upon this foundation, <a2_0>Dr. Moustakas<a2_0/> at Boston University patented a method for producing high-brightness blue LEDs using a new two-step process. Two years later, in 1993, high-brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated again by <a1_0><b6_0>Shuji Nakamura<b6_0/><a1_0/> of Nichia Corporation using a gallium nitride growth process similar to Dr. Moustakas's. Both <b7_0>Dr. Moustakas<b7_0/> and Mr. Nakamura were issued separate patents, which confused the issue of who was the original inventor (partly because although Dr. Moustakas invented his first, Dr. Nakamura filed first).[citation needed] This new development revolutionized LED lighting, making high-power blue light sources practical, leading to the development of technologies like <a3_0><b8_0>BlueRay<b8_0/><a3_0/>, as well as allowing the bright high resolution screens of modern <a4_0><b9_0>tablets<b9_0/><a4_0/> and phones.[citation needed]"}
