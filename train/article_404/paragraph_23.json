This is a method analogous to the way <a2_0><b7_0>fluorescent lamps<b7_0/><a2_0/> work. This method is less efficient than <a3_0>blue<a3_0/> LEDs with YAG:Ce phosphor, as the Stokes shift is larger, so more energy is converted to heat, but yields light with better spectral characteristics, which render color better. Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the <b8_0>blue<b8_0/> ones, both methods offer comparable brightness. A concern is that <a4_0>UV light<a4_0/> may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin."}
