LEDs are often ideal as a light source due to the requirements of the sensors. LEDs are used as motion sensors, for example in optical computer mice. The <a0_0><b5_0>Nintendo Wii<a0_0/>'s<b5_0/> sensor bar uses infrared LEDs. <a1_0><b6_0>Pulse oximeters<b6_0/><a1_0/> use them for measuring oxygen saturation. Some flatbed scanners use arrays of <a2_0>RGB LEDs<a2_0/> rather than the typical cold-cathode fluorescent lamp as the light source. Having independent control of three illuminated colors allows the scanner to calibrate itself for more accurate color balance, and there is no need for <a3_0>warm-up<a3_0/>. Further, its sensors only need be monochromatic, since at any one time the page being scanned is only lit by one color of light. Since LEDs can also be used as photodiodes, they can be used for both photo emission and detection. This could be used, for example, in a touchscreen that registers reflected light from a finger or stylus. Many materials and biological systems are sensitive to, or dependent on, light. Grow lights use LEDs to <a4_0>increase photosynthesis in plants<a4_0/>, and bacteria and viruses can be removed from water and other substances using <b7_0>UV LEDs<b7_0/> for sterilization."}
