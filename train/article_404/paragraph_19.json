Most perceivable colors can be formed by mixing different amounts of three primary colors. This allows precise dynamic color control. As more effort is devoted to investigating this method, multi-color LEDs should have profound influence on the fundamental method that we use to produce and control light color. However, before this type of LED can play a role on the market, several technical problems must be solved. These include that this type of LED's emission <a1_0><b4_0>power decays exponentially with rising temperature<b4_0/><a1_0/>, resulting in a <a2_0><b5_0>substantial change in color stability<b5_0/><a2_0/>. Such problems inhibit and may preclude industrial use. Thus, many new package designs aimed at solving this problem have been proposed and their results are now being reproduced by researchers and scientists."}
