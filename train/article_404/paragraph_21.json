Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on <a1_0>the <b6_0>spectral distribution of the resultant light output<a1_0/> and the original wavelength<b6_0/> of the LED itself. For example, the luminous efficacy of a typical YAG yellow <b7_0>phosphor<b7_0/> based white LED ranges from <a2_0>3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy<a2_0/> of the original blue LED because of the human eye's greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue (as modeled in the luminosity function). Due to the simplicity of manufacturing the <a3_0>phosphor method<a3_0/> is still the most popular method for making high-intensity white LEDs. The design and production of a light source or light fixture using a <a4_0><b8_0>monochrome<b8_0/><a4_0/> emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex RGB system, and the majority of high-intensity white LEDs presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion."}
