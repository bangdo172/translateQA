They have an <a0_0><b4_0>active region consisting of one or more InGaN quantum wells sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN<b4_0/><a0_0/>, called cladding layers. <a1_0><b5_0>By varying the relative In/Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells<a1_0/>, the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber<b5_0/>. <a2_0><b6_0>Aluminium gallium nitride<b6_0/><a2_0/> (AlGaN) of varying Al/Ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet LEDs, but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of InGaN/GaN blue/green devices. If un-alloyed GaN is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers, the device will emit near-ultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around 365 nm. <a3_0><b7_0>Green<b7_0/><a3_0/> LEDs manufactured from the InGaN/GaN system are far more efficient and brighter than green LEDs produced with non-nitride material systems, but practical devices still exhibit efficiency too low for high-brightness applications.[citation needed]"}
