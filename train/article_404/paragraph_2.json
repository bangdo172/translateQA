As noted by <a1_0><b6_0>Kroemer Braunstein<b6_0/><a1_0/>\".. had set up a simple optical communications link: Music emerging from a record player was used via suitable electronics to modulate the forward current of <a2_0>a <b7_0>GaAs diode<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The emitted light was detected by <a3_0>a <b8_0>PbS diode<b8_0/><a3_0/> some distance away. This signal was fed into an <a4_0><b9_0>audio amplifier<b9_0/><a4_0/>, and played back by a loudspeaker. Intercepting the beam stopped the music. We had a great deal of fun playing with this setup.\" This setup presaged the use of LEDs for optical communication applications."}
