In <a0_0><b5_0>2007<b5_0/><a0_0/>, Gabe Newell of Valve said \"The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted\". He continued \"I'd say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'\". <a1_0><b6_0>Doug Lombardi<b6_0/><a1_0/> VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that they are interested in developing for the console and are looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve's position, \"Until we have the ability to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform\". At Sony's E3 <a2_0><b7_0>2010<b7_0/><a2_0/> press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing <a3_0>Portal 2<a3_0/> for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of <a4_0><b9_0>Steamworks<b9_0/><a4_0/> (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of <b8_0>Portal 2<b8_0/> the best console version on the market."}
