This was first demonstrated publicly on PS3 using Sony's own technology in January 2009 at the Consumer Electronics Show. Journalists were shown Wipeout HD and <a1_0><b10_0>Gran Turismo 5 Prologue<b10_0/><a1_0/> in 3D as a demonstration of how the technology might work if it is implemented in the future. Firmware update <a2_0><b11_0>3.30<b11_0/><a2_0/> officially allowed PS3 titles to be played in <b6_0>3D<b6_0/>, requiring a compatible display for use. System software update 3.50 prepared it for <a4_0><b7_0><b13_0>3D films<b13_0/><b7_0/><a4_0/>. While the game itself must be programmed to take advantage of the 3D technology, titles may be <a3_0><b12_0>patched<b12_0/><a3_0/> to add in the functionality retroactively. Titles with such patches include Wipeout HD, Pain, and <b8_0>Super Stardust HD<b8_0/>."}
