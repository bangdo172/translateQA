He believes these factors are pushing <a0_0><b5_0>developers<b5_0/><a0_0/> away from working on the console. In an interview with <a3_0><b8_0>The Times<b8_0/><a3_0/> Kotick stated \"I'm getting concerned about Sony; the PlayStation 3 is losing a bit of momentum and they don't make it easy for me to support the platform.\" He continued, \"It's expensive to develop for the console, and the Wii and the Xbox are just selling better. Games generate a better <a1_0><b6_0>return on invested capital<b6_0/><a1_0/> (ROIC) on the Xbox than on the PlayStation.\" Kotick also claimed that <b7_0>Activision Blizzard<b7_0/> may stop supporting the system if the situation is not addressed. \"[Sony has] to cut the [PS3's retail] price, because if they don't, the attach rates are likely to slow. If we are being realistic, we might have to stop supporting Sony.\" Kotick received heavy criticism for the statement, notably from developer <a4_0><b9_0>Bioware<b9_0/><a4_0/> who questioned the wisdom of the threatened move, and referred to the statement as \"silly.\""}
