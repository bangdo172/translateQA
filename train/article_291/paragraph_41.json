Criticism was placed on the new <a2_0><b6_0>disc loader<b6_0/><a2_0/>, stating: \"The cover can be moved by hand if you wish, there's also an eject button to do the work for you, but there is no software eject from the triangle button menus in the Xross Media Bar (XMB) interface. In addition, you have to <b7_0><b8_0>close the cover<b8_0/><b7_0/> by hand, which can be a bit fiddly if it's upright, and the PS3 won't start reading a disc unless you do [<a3_0>close the cover<a3_0/>].\" They also said there is no real drop in retail price."}
