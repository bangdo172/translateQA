The cost of manufacturing <a1_0><b6_0>Cell<b6_0/><a1_0/> microprocessors has fallen dramatically as a result of moving to the 65 nm production process, and Blu-ray Disc <a2_0><b7_0>diodes<b7_0/><a2_0/> have become cheaper to manufacture. As of January 2008, each unit cost around $400 to manufacture; by August 2009, Sony had reduced costs by a total of <a4_0><b9_0>70%<b9_0/><a4_0/>, meaning it only costs Sony around <a3_0><b8_0>$240<b8_0/><a3_0/> per unit."}
