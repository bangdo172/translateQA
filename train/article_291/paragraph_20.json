By <a0_0><b4_0>March 2 (UTC), 2010<b4_0/><a0_0/>, owners of original PS3 models could connect to PSN successfully and the clock no longer showed December 31, 1999. Sony stated that the affected models incorrectly identified 2010 as <a1_0><b5_0>a leap year<b5_0/><a1_0/>, because of a bug in the <a2_0><b6_0>BCD<b6_0/><a2_0/> method of storing the date. However, for some users, the hardware's <a3_0><b7_0><b8_0>operating system clock<b8_0/><b7_0/><a3_0/> (mainly updated from the internet and not associated with the internal clock) needed to be updated manually or by re-syncing it via the internet."}
