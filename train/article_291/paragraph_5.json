New features included a slimmer form factor, decreased power consumption, and a <a2_0><b12_0>quieter<b12_0/><a2_0/> cooling system. It was released in major territories by September 2009. As part of the release for the slim model, the console logo ceased using the \"<a1_0><b11_0>Spider-Man font<b11_0/><a1_0/>\" (the same font used for the title of Sony's Spider-Man 3) and the capitalized PLAYSTATION 3. It instead reverted to a more traditional PlayStation- and PlayStation 2-like 'PlayStation 3' logo with \"PS3\" imprinted on the console. Along with the redesigning of the console and logo, the boot screen of all consoles changed from <a3_0>\"<b13_0>Sony Computer Entertainment<b13_0/>\"<a3_0/> to \"PS3 PlayStation 3\", with a new chime and the game start splash screen being dropped. The <a4_0><b14_0>cover art<b14_0/><a4_0/> and packaging of games was also changed."}
