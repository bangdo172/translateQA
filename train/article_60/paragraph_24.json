Although they are sometimes mistaken for each other, the <a2_0>Adult Contemporary<a2_0/> chart and the Adult Top 40 chart are separate charts, and songs reaching one chart might not reach the other. In addition, <a3_0>hot AC<a3_0/> is another subgenre of radio programming that is distinct from the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart as it exists today, despite the apparent similarity in name."}
