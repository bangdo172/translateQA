Collins has been described by AllMusic as \"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\". However, with the combination of MTV and AC radio, adult contemporary appeared harder to define as a genre, with established soft-rock artists of the past still charting pop hits and receiving airplay alongside mainstream radio fare from newer artists at the time."}
