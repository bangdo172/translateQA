In response, the Ottoman governor of Cyprus arrested and executed <a1_0>486<a1_0/> prominent Greek Cypriots, including the Archbishop of Cyprus, Kyprianos and four other bishops. In 1828, modern Greece's first president <a2_0>Ioannis Kapodistrias<a2_0/> called for <a3_0>union of Cyprus with Greece<a3_0/>, and numerous minor uprisings took place. Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, although none were successful. After centuries of neglect by the Turks, the unrelenting poverty of most of the people, and the ever-present tax collectors fuelled Greek nationalism, and by the 20th century idea of enosis, or union, with newly independent Greece was firmly rooted among Greek Cypriots."}
