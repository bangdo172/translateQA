In 2014, a group of Cypriot refugees and a European parliamentarian, later joined by the Cypriot government, filed a complaint to the International Court of Justice, accusing <a1_0>Turkey<a1_0/> of violating the Geneva Conventions by <a3_0>directly or indirectly transferring its civilian population into occupied territory<a3_0/>. Over the preceding ten years, civilian transfer by Turkey had \"reached new heights\", in the words of one US ambassador.[f] Other violations of the Geneva and the Hague Conventions\u2014both ratified by Turkey\u2014amount to what archaeologist Sophocles Hadjisavvas called \"the organized destruction of Greek and Christian heritage in the north\". These violations include looting of cultural treasures, deliberate destruction of churches, neglect of works of art, and altering the names of important historical sites, which was condemned by the International Council on Monuments and Sites. Hadjisavvas has asserted that these actions are motivated by a Turkish policy of erasing the Greek presence in Northern Cyprus within a framework of ethnic cleansing, as well as by greed and profit-seeking on the part of the individuals involved."}
