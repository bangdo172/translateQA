However, the value of a state high-school diploma is limited by the fact that the grades obtained account for only around <a3_0>25%<a3_0/> of the final grade for each topic, with the remaining 75% assigned by the teacher during the semester, in a minimally transparent way. Cypriot universities (like universities in Greece) ignore <a0_0>high school grades<a0_0/> almost entirely for admissions purposes. While a <a1_0>high-school diploma<a1_0/> is mandatory for university attendance, admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered <a2_0>university entrance examinations<a2_0/> that all university candidates are required to take."}
