However, the Republic of Cyprus is de facto partitioned into <a1_0>two main parts<a1_0/>; the area under the effective control of the Republic, comprising about <a2_0>59%<a2_0/> of the island's area, and the north, administered by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is recognised only by <a3_0>Turkey<a3_0/>, covering about 36% of the island's area. The international community considers the northern part of the island as <a4_0>territory of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by Turkish forces<a4_0/>. The occupation is viewed as illegal under international law, amounting to illegal occupation of EU territory since Cyprus became a member of the European Union."}
