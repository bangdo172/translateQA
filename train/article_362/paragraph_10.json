This system had its climax of deformation so long ago (probably in <a1_0><b6_0>Permian time<b6_0/><a1_0/>) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or to the survival of the most resistant rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern <b7_0>crustal movement,<b7_0/> causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally, the southeastern section has undergone an <b4_0>elevation<b4_0/> resulting in the advance of the land upon the sea."}
