The height of the minuscules varies, as some of them have parts higher or <a2_0>lower than the average<a2_0/>, i.e. ascenders and descenders. In Times New Roman, for instance, b, d, f, h, k, l, t  are the letters with <a1_0>ascenders<a1_0/>, and g, j, p, q, y are the ones with descenders. Further to this, with old-style numerals still used by some traditional or classical fonts\u2014although most do have a set of alternative Lining Figures\u2014 6 and <a3_0>8<a3_0/> make up the ascender set, and 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 the descender set."}
