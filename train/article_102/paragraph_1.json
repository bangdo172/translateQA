This convention is usually called <a2_0>sentence case<a2_0/>. It may also be applied to <a4_0>publication titles<a4_0/>, especially in bibliographic references and library catalogues. Examples of global publishers whose English-language house styles prescribe sentence-case titles and headings include the <a3_0>International Organization for Standardization<a3_0/>."}
