In orthography, the uppercase is primarily reserved for <a1_0>special<a1_0/> purposes, such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun, which makes the <a2_0>lowercase<a2_0/> the more common variant in text. In mathematics, letter case may indicate the relationship between objects with uppercase letters often representing \"superior\" objects (e.g. X could be a set containing the generic member x). Engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in <a3_0>upper-case<a3_0/> letters, which are <a4_0>easier to distinguish than lowercase<a4_0/>, especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small."}
