In other words, while the <a1_0>shapes<a1_0/> of letters like A, B, E, H, K, M, O, P, T, X, Y and so on are shared between the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets (and small differences in their canonical forms may be considered to be of a merely typographical nature), it would still be problematic for a multilingual character set or a font to provide only a <a2_0>single codepoint<a2_0/> for, say, uppercase letter B, as this would make it quite difficult for a wordprocessor to change that single uppercase letter to one of the three different choices for the lower-case letter, b (Latin), \u03b2 (Greek), or \u0432 (Cyrillic). Without <a4_0>letter case<a4_0/>, a \"unified European alphabet\" \u2013 such as AB\u0411C\u0413D\u0394\u0395Z\u0404\u0417F\u03a6GHI\u0418J\u2026Z, with an appropriate subset for each language \u2013 is feasible; but considering letter case, it becomes very clear that these alphabets are rather distinct <a3_0>sets of symbols<a3_0/>."}
