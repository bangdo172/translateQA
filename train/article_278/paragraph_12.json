For much of American history, the dominant notion of the rule of law, in this setting, has been some version of <b5_0><b6_0>A. V. Dicey<b6_0/><b5_0/>'s: \u201cno man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land.\u201d That is, <a2_0>individuals<a2_0/> should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction. As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place. Even Charles Evans Hughes, <a3_0>a Chief Justice of the United States<a3_0/>, believed \u201cyou must have administration, and you must have administration by <b7_0>administrative officers<b7_0/>.\u201d By <a0_0>1941<a0_0/>, a compromise had emerged. If administrators adopted procedures that more-or-less tracked \"the ordinary legal manner\" of the courts, further review of the facts by \"the ordinary Courts of the land\" was unnecessary. That is, if you had your \"day in commission,\" the rule of law did not require a further \"day in court.\" Thus <b8_0>Dicey's<b8_0/> rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form."}
