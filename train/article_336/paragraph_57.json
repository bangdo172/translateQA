The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in <a1_0>1994<a1_0/> when area code 610 was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. Overlay area code 267 was added to the 215 service area in <a2_0>1997<a2_0/>, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas (area code 445 to 215, area code 835 to 610) was delayed and later rescinded."}
