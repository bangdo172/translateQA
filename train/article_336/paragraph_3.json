The <a0_0>Lenape<a0_0/> are a Native American tribe and First Nations band government. They are also called Delaware Indians and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island and the Lower Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts. Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly <a2_0>smallpox<a2_0/>, and violent conflict with Europeans. <a1_0>Iroquois<a1_0/> people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the <a3_0>upper Ohio River basin<a3_0/>. The American Revolutionary War and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the Indian removal policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape now reside in the US state of <a4_0>Oklahoma<a4_0/>, with some communities living also in Wisconsin, Ontario (Canada) and in their traditional homelands."}
