In 1909, Water Works was decommissioned as the city transitioned to modern sand filtration methods. Today, the <a1_0>Philadelphia Water Department<a1_0/> (PWD) provides drinking water, wastewater collection, and stormwater services for Philadelphia, as well as surrounding counties. PWD draws about 57 percent of its drinking water from the <a2_0>Delaware River and the balance from the Schuylkill River<a2_0/>. The public wastewater system consists of three water pollution control plants, <a3_0>21<a3_0/> pumping stations, and about <a4_0>3,657 miles<a4_0/> of sewers. A 2007 investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency found elevated levels of Iodine-131 in the city's potable water.[citation needed] In 2012, the EPA's readings discovered that the city had the highest readings of I-131 in the nation. The city campaigned against an Associated Press report that the high levels of I-131 were the results of local gas drilling in the Upper Delaware River.[citation needed]"}
