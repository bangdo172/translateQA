As a result, the economic base of Philadelphia, which had historically been <a0_0>manufacturing<a0_0/>, declined significantly. In addition, consolidation in several American industries (retailing, financial services and health care in particular) reduced the number of companies headquartered in Philadelphia. The economic impact of these changes would reduce Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government. Philadelphia struggled through a long period of adjustment to these economic changes, coupled with significant demographic change as wealthier residents moved into the nearby <a2_0>suburbs<a2_0/> and more <a3_0>immigrants<a3_0/> moved into the city. The city in fact approached bankruptcy in the <a1_0>late 1980s<a1_0/>. Revitalization began in the 1990s, with gentrification turning around many neighborhoods and reversing its decades-long trend of population loss."}
