Elected at-large, the mayor is limited to <a1_0>two consecutive four-year terms<a1_0/> under the city's home rule charter, but can run for the position again after an intervening term. The Mayor is <a2_0>Jim Kenney<a2_0/>, who replaced Michael Nutter, who served two terms from 2009 to January 2016. Kenney, as all Philadelphia mayors have been since 1952, is a member of the <a3_0>Democratic Party<a3_0/>, which tends to dominate local politics so thoroughly that the Democratic Mayoral primary is often more widely covered than the general election. The legislative branch, the <a4_0>Philadelphia City Council<a4_0/>, consists of ten council members representing individual districts and seven members elected at large. Democrats currently hold 14 seats, with Republicans representing two allotted at-large seats for the minority party, as well as the Northeast-based Tenth District. The current council president is Darrell Clarke."}
