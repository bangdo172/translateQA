While newer homes are scattered throughout the city, much of the housing is from the <a3_0>early 20th century or older<a3_0/>. The great age of the homes has created numerous problems, including blight and vacant lots in many parts of the city, while other neighborhoods such as <a4_0>Society Hill<a4_0/>, which has the largest concentration of 18th-century architecture in the United States, have been rehabilitated and gentrified."}
