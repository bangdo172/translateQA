There are about 300 radicals and 100 are in common use. Creating a new character by modifying the radical is an easy way to disambiguate homographs among x\u00edngsh\u0113ngz\u00ec pictophonetic compounds. This practice began long before the standardization of Chinese script by Qin Shi Huang and continues to the present day. The traditional 3rd-person pronoun t\u0101 (\u4ed6 \"he, she, it\"), which is written with the \"person radical\", illustrates modifying significs to form <a0_0>new characters<a0_0/>. In modern usage, there is a graphic distinction between t\u0101 (\u5979 \"she\") with the \"woman radical\", t\u0101 (\u7260 \"it\") with the \"animal radical\", t\u0101 (\u5b83 \"it\") with the \"roof radical\", and t\u0101 (\u7942 \"He\") with the \"deity radical\", One consequence of modifying radicals is the <a1_0>fossilization<a1_0/> of rare and obscure variant logographs, some of which are not even used in Classical Chinese. For instance, he \u548c <a2_0>\"harmony, peace\"<a2_0/>, which combines the \"grain radical\" with the \"mouth radical\", has infrequent variants \u548a with the radicals reversed and \u9fa2 with the \"flute radical\"."}
