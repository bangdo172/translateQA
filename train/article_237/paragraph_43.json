Some characters were given simplified forms called shinjitai \u65b0\u5b57\u4f53 (lit. \"new character forms\", the older forms were then labelled the ky\u016bjitai \u65e7\u5b57\u4f53, lit. \"old character forms\"). <a1_0>The number of characters in common use<a1_0/> was restricted, and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established, first the 1850-character t\u014dy\u014d kanji \u5f53\u7528\u6f22\u5b57 list in 1945, the 1945-character j\u014dy\u014d kanji \u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57 list in 1981, and a 2136-character reformed version of the j\u014dy\u014d kanji in <a2_0>2010<a2_0/>. Many variant forms of characters and obscure alternatives for common characters were officially discouraged. This was done with the goal of facilitating learning for children and simplifying kanji use in literature and periodicals. These are simply guidelines, hence many characters outside these standards are still widely known and commonly used, especially those used for personal and place names (for the latter, see jinmeiy\u014d kanji),[citation needed] as well as for some common words such as \"dragon\" (Japanese kana: \u305f\u3064, R\u014dmaji: tatsu) in which both the shinjitai \u7adc and the ky\u016bjitai \u9f8d forms of the kanji are both acceptable and widely known amongst native Japanese speakers."}
