In Chinese these units are disyllabic and standardly written with two characters, as \u5398\u7c73 l\u00edm\u01d0 \"centimeter\" (\u5398 centi-, \u7c73 meter) or \u5343\u74e6 qi\u0101nw\u01ce \"kilowatt\". However, in the 19th century these were often written via compound characters, pronounced disyllabically, such as \u74e9 for \u5343\u74e6 or \u7cce for \u5398\u7c73 \u2013 some of these characters were also used in Japan, where they were pronounced with borrowed European readings instead. These have now fallen out of general use, but are occasionally seen. Less systematic examples include \u5715 <a1_0>t\u00fash\u016bgu\u01cen<a1_0/> \"library\", a contraction of \u5716\u66f8\u9928, A four-morpheme word, \u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49 sh\u00e8hu\u00ec zh\u01d4y\u00ec \"<a2_0>socialism<a2_0/>\", is commonly written with a single character formed by combining the last character, \u4e49, with the radical of the first, \u793e, yielding roughly \u793b\u4e49."}
