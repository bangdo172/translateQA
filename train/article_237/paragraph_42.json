Generally, the <a1_0>j\u014dy\u014d kanji<a1_0/> are more similar to traditional Chinese characters than simplified Chinese characters are to traditional Chinese characters. \"Simplified\" refers to having significant differences from the Taiwan standard, not necessarily being a newly created character or a newly performed substitution. The <a0_0>characters in the Hong Kong standard and the Kangxi Dictionary<a0_0/> are also known as \"Traditional,\" but are not shown."}
