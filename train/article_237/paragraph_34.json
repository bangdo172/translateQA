Some of these can be considered logograms, where <a2_0>characters represent whole words rather than syllable-morphemes<a2_0/>, though these are generally instead considered ligatures or abbreviations (similar to scribal abbreviations, such as & for \"et\"), and as non-standard. These do see use, particularly in handwriting or decoration, but also in some cases in print. In Chinese, these ligatures are called h\u00e9w\u00e9n (\u5408\u6587), h\u00e9sh\u016b (\u5408\u66f8) or h\u00e9t\u01d0z\u00ec (\u5408\u4f53\u5b57), and in the special case of combining two characters, these are known as \"two-syllable Chinese characters\" (\u53cc\u97f3\u8282\u6c49\u5b57, \u96d9\u97f3\u7bc0\u6f22\u5b57)."}
