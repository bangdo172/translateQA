All these characters have on the left a radical of three short strokes (\u6c35), which is a reduced form of the character \u6c34 shu\u01d0 meaning \"water\", indicating that the character has a semantic connection with water. The <a0_0>right-hand side<a0_0/> in each case is a phonetic indicator. For example, in the case of \u6c96 ch\u014dng (Old Chinese *\u0261-lju\u014b), the phonetic indicator is \u4e2d zh\u014dng (Old Chinese *k-lju\u014b), which by itself means \"middle\". In this case it can be seen that the pronunciation of the character is slightly different from that of its <a1_0>phonetic indicator<a1_0/>; the process of historical <a2_0>phonetic change<a2_0/> means that the composition of such characters can sometimes seem arbitrary today."}
