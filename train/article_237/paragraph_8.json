A notable example is <a1_0>pipa<a1_0/> (a Chinese lute, also a fruit, the loquat, of similar shape) \u2013 originally written as \u6279\u628a with the hand radical, referring to the down and up strokes when playing this instrument, which was then changed to \u6787\u6777 (tree radical), which is still used for the fruit, while the character was changed to \u7435\u7436 when referring to the instrument. In other cases a <a2_0>compound word<a2_0/> may coincidentally share a radical without this being meaningful."}
