These characters are composed of two parts: one of a limited set of characters (the <a2_0>semantic indicator<a2_0/>, often graphically simplified) which suggests the general meaning of the compound character, and another character (the phonetic indicator) whose pronunciation suggests the pronunciation of the compound character. In most cases the <a1_0>semantic indicator<a1_0/> is also the radical under which the character is listed in dictionaries."}
