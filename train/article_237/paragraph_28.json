However, this is not in common use. The most complex character that can be input using the Microsoft New Phonetic IME 2002a for traditional Chinese is \u9f98 (d\u00e1, \"the appearance of a dragon flying\"). It is composed of the dragon radical represented three times, for a total of 16 \u00d7 3 = 48 strokes. Among the most complex characters in modern dictionaries and also in frequent modern use are \u7c72 (<a2_0>y\u00f9<a2_0/>, \"to implore\"), with 32 strokes; \u9b31 (y\u00f9, \"luxuriant, lush; gloomy\"), with 29 strokes, as in \u6182\u9b31 (y\u014duy\u00f9, \"depressed\"); \u8c54 (y\u00e0n, \"colorful\"), with 28 strokes; and \u91c1 (x\u00ecn, \"quarrel\"), with 25 strokes, as in \u6311\u91c1 (ti\u01ceox\u00ecn, \"to pick a fight\"). Also in occasional modern use is \u9c7b (<a1_0>xi\u0101n<a1_0/> \"fresh\"; variant of \u9bae xi\u0101n) with 33 strokes."}
