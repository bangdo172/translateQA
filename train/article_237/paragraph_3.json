In modern Chinese (esp. Mandarin Chinese), characters do not necessarily correspond to words; indeed the majority of Chinese words today consist of two or more characters due to the merging and loss of sounds in the Chinese language over time. Rather, a <a1_0>character<a1_0/> almost always corresponds to a single syllable that is also a morpheme. However, there are a few exceptions to this general correspondence, including <a2_0>bisyllabic morphemes<a2_0/> (written with two characters), bimorphemic syllables (written with two characters) and cases where a single character represents a polysyllabic word or phrase."}
