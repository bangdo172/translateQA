For example, the <a1_0>orthodox character<a1_0/> \u4f86 l\u00e1i (\"come\") was written with the structure \u6765 in the <a2_0>clerical script<a2_0/> (\u96b6\u4e66 / \u96b8\u66f8, l\u00ecsh\u016b) of the Han dynasty. This clerical form uses one fewer stroke, and was thus adopted as a simplified form. The character \u96f2 y\u00fan (\"cloud\") was written with the structure \u4e91 in the oracle bone script of the Shang dynasty, and had remained in use later as a phonetic loan in the meaning of \"to say\" while the \u96e8 radical was added to differentiate meanings. The simplified form adopts the original structure."}
