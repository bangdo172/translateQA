Although mature clerical script, also called \u516b\u5206 (<a1_0>b\u0101f\u0113n<a1_0/>) script, was dominant at that time, an early type of cursive script was also in use by the Han by at least as early as 24 BC (during the very late Western Han period),[b] incorporating cursive forms popular at the time, well as many elements from the vulgar writing of the Warring State of Qin. By around the time of the Eastern Jin dynasty, this Han cursive became known as \u7ae0\u8349 zh\u0101ngc\u01ceo (also known as \u96b6\u8349 / \u96b8\u8349 l\u00ecc\u01ceo today), or in English sometimes clerical cursive, ancient cursive, or draft cursive. Some believe that the name, based on \u7ae0 <a2_0>zh\u0101ng<a2_0/> meaning \"orderly\", arose because the script was a more orderly form of cursive than the modern form, which emerged during the Eastern Jin dynasty and is still in use today, called \u4eca\u8349 j\u012bnc\u01ceo or \"modern cursive\"."}
