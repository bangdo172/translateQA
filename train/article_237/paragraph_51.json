For example, the name for the hanja \u6c34 is \ubb3c \uc218 (<a1_0>mul-su<a1_0/>) in which \ubb3c (<a2_0>mul<a2_0/>) is the native Korean pronunciation for \"water\", while \uc218 (su) is the Sino-Korean pronunciation of the character. The naming of hanja is similar to if \"water\" were named \"water-aqua\", \"horse-equus\", or \"gold-aurum\" based on a hybridization of both the English and the Latin names. Other examples include \uc0ac\ub78c \uc778 (saram-in) for \u4eba \"person/people\", \ud070 \ub300 (keun-dae) for \u5927 \"big/large//great\", \uc791\uc744 \uc18c (jakeul-so) for \u5c0f \"small/little\", \uc544\ub798 \ud558 (arae-ha) for \u4e0b \"underneath/below/low\", \uc544\ube44 \ubd80 (abi-bu) for \u7236 \"father\", and \ub098\ub77c\uc774\ub984 \ud55c (naraimreum-han) for \u97d3 \"Han/Korea\"."}
