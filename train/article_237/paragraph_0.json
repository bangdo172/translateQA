In Standard Chinese they are called <a1_0>Hanzi<a1_0/> (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u5b57; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u5b57). They have been adapted to write a number of other languages including: Japanese, where they are known as kanji, Korean, where they are known as hanja, and Vietnamese in a system known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m. Collectively, they are known as CJKV characters. In English, they are sometimes called Han characters. Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia, and historic use throughout the Sinosphere, Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world."}
