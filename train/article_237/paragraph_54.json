The syllabaries differ because <a1_0>they sometimes selected different characters for a syllable<a1_0/>, and because they used different strategies to reduce these characters for easy writing: the angular katakana were obtained by selecting a part of each character, while hiragana were derived from the cursive forms of whole characters. <a2_0>Modern Japanese writing<a2_0/> uses a composite system, using kanji for word stems, hiragana for inflexional endings and grammatical words, and katakana to transcribe non-Chinese loanwords as well as serve as a method to emphasize native words (similar to how italics are used in Romance languages)."}
