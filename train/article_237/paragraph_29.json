According to Jo\u00ebl Bellassen (1989), the most complex Chinese character is /\ud869\udea5 (U+2A6A5) <a1_0>zh\u00e9<a1_0/>  listen (help\u00b7info), meaning \"verbose\" and containing sixty-four strokes; this character fell from use around the 5th century. It might be argued, however, that while containing the most strokes, it is not necessarily the most complex character (in terms of difficulty), as it simply requires writing the same sixteen-stroke character \u9f8d l\u00f3ng (lit. \"dragon\") four times in the space for one. Another 64-stroke character is /\ud841\udd3b (U+2053B) <a2_0>zh\u00e8ng<a2_0/> composed of \u8208 x\u012bng/x\u00ecng (lit. \"flourish\") four times."}
