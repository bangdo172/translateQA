The most important rules regard the strokes employed, stroke placement, and stroke order. Just as each region that uses <a1_0>Chinese characters<a1_0/> has standardized character forms, each also has standardized stroke orders, with each standard being different. Most characters can be written with just one correct stroke order, though some words also have many valid stroke orders, which may occasionally result in different stroke counts. Some <a2_0>characters<a2_0/> are also written with different stroke orders due to character simplification."}
