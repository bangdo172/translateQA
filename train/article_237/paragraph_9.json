Often these finds are accompanied by media reports that push back the purported beginnings of Chinese writing by thousands of years. However, because these marks occur singly, without any implied context, and are made crudely and simply, Qiu Xigui concluded that \"we do not have any basis for stating that these constituted writing nor is there reason to conclude that they were ancestral to Shang dynasty <a1_0>Chinese characters<a1_0/>.\" They do however demonstrate a history of sign use in the <a2_0>Yellow<a2_0/> River valley during the Neolithic through to the Shang period."}
