Significant historically recent coinages date to scientific terms of the 19th century. Specifically, Chinese coined new characters for chemical elements \u2013 see chemical elements in East Asian languages \u2013 which continue to be used and taught in schools in China and Taiwan. In Japan, in the Meiji era (specifically, late 19th century), new characters were coined for some (but not all) SI units, such as \u7c81 (\u7c73 \"meter\" + \u5343 \"thousand, kilo-\") for kilometer.
