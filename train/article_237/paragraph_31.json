In the Oracle Bone script, personal names, ritual items, and even phrases such as \u53d7\u53c8(\u7950) sh\u00f2u y\u00f2u \"receive blessings\" are commonly contracted into single characters. A dramatic example is that in medieval manuscripts \u83e9\u85a9 p\u00fas\u00e0 \"<a2_0>bodhisattva<a2_0/>\" (simplified: \u83e9\u8428) is sometimes written with a single character formed of a 2\u00d72 grid of four \u5341 (derived from the grass radical over two \u5341). However, for the sake of consistency and standardization, the <a1_0>CPC<a1_0/> seeks to limit the use of such polysyllabic characters in public writing to ensure that every character only has one syllable."}
