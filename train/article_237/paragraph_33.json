In handwriting, numbers are very frequently squeezed into one space or combined \u2013 common ligatures include \u5eff ni\u00e0n, \"twenty\", normally read as \u4e8c\u5341 \u00e8rsh\u00ed, \u5345 s\u00e0, \"thirty\", normally read as \u4e09\u5341 s\u0101nsh\u00ed, and \u534c x\u00ec \"forty\", normally read as \u56db\u5341 \"s\u00ecsh\u00ed\". In some cases counters are also merged into one character, such as \u4e03\u5341\u4eba q\u012bsh\u00ed r\u00e9n \"seventy people\". Another common abbreviation is \u95e8 with a \"T\" written inside it, for \u554f\u984c, \u95ee\u9898, w\u00e8nt\u00ed (\"question; problem\"), where the \"T\" is from pinyin for the second syllable t\u00ed \u9898. Since <a0_0>polysyllabic<a0_0/> characters are often non-standard, they are often excluded incharcter dictionaries."}
