Newspapers have dealt with this problem in varying ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters, including a picture of the personality, or, especially as is the case with Yu Shyi-kun, simply substituting a homophone for the rare character in the hope that the reader would be able to make the correct inference. Taiwanese political posters, <a1_0>movie posters<a1_0/> etc. will often add the bopomofo phonetic symbols next to such a character. <a2_0>Japanese newspapers<a2_0/> may render such names and words in katakana instead of kanji, and it is accepted practice for people to write names for which they are unsure of the correct kanji in katakana instead."}
