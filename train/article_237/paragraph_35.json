In modern Chinese 10% of morphemes only occur as part of a given compound. However, a few morphemes are disyllabic, some of them dating back to Classical Chinese. Excluding foreign loan words, these are typically words for plants and small animals. They are usually written with a pair of phono-semantic compound characters sharing a common radical. Examples are \u8774\u8776 h\u00fadi\u00e9 \"butterfly\" and \u73ca\u745a sh\u0101nh\u00fa \"coral\". Note that the <a2_0>\u8774 h\u00fa of h\u00fadi\u00e9 and the \u745a h\u00fa of sh\u0101nh\u00fa<a2_0/> have the same phonetic, \u80e1, but different radicals (\"insect\" and \"jade\", respectively). Neither exists as an independent morpheme except as a poetic abbreviation of the disyllabic word."}
