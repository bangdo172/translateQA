However, despite the Qin script standardization, more than one script remained in use at the time. For example, a little-known, rectilinear and roughly executed kind of common (vulgar) writing had for centuries coexisted with the more formal seal script in the Qin state, and the popularity of this vulgar writing grew as the use of writing itself became more widespread. By the Warring States period, an immature form of clerical script called \"early clerical\" or \"proto-clerical\" had already developed in the state of Qin based upon this vulgar writing, and with influence from seal script as well. The coexistence of the three scripts \u2013 small seal, vulgar and proto-clerical, with the latter evolving gradually in the Qin to early Han dynasties into <a1_0><a2_0>clerical<a1_0/> script<a2_0/> \u2013 runs counter to the traditional belief that the Qin dynasty had one script only, and that clerical script was suddenly invented in the early Han dynasty from the small seal script."}
