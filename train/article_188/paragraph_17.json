The middle layer, the dermis, is <a2_0><b8_0>15 to 40 times thicker<b8_0/><a2_0/> than the epidermis. The dermis is made up of many components, such as <a3_0><b9_0>bony structures and blood vessels<b9_0/><a3_0/>. The hypodermis is made up of <a4_0>adipose tissue<a4_0/>. Its job is to store lipids, and to provide cushioning and insulation. The thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species."}
