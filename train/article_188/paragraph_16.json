Contraction of the diaphragm <b7_0>flattens the dome<b7_0/>, increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the <a0_0>larynx, trachea and bronchi<a0_0/> and expands <b8_0>the alveoli<b8_0/>. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During <a1_0>exercise<a1_0/>, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself also is able to expand and contract <b6_0>the thoracic cavity<b6_0/> to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a <a2_0>bellows lung<a2_0/> as it <b5_0>resembles a <a3_0>blacksmith's bellows<b5_0/><a3_0/>. Mammals take oxygen into their lungs, and <b4_0>discard carbon dioxide<b4_0/>."}
