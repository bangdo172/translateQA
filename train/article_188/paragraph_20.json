A marsupial has a short gestation period, typically shorter than <b7_0>its estrous cycle<b7_0/>, and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located <b5_0>in the front of the mother's abdomen<b5_0/>. This is the plesyomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; <b6_0>the presence of <a2_0>epipubic bones<b6_0/><a2_0/> in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy. Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way."}
