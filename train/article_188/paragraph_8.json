Most of these findings have been independently validated by <b4_0>retrotransposon presence/absence data<b4_0/>. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals- <a1_0><b5_0>Afrotheria, Xenarthra, and Boreoeutheria<b5_0/><a1_0/>- which diverged from <b6_0>early common ancestors in the Cretaceous<b6_0/>. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal with respect to other placentals. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra), and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages- <a2_0><b7_0>Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria<b7_0/><a2_0/>."}
