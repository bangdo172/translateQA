The Christians set it afire before abandoning it, and the Almoravid Masdali took possession on 5 May 1109. The event was commemorated in a poem by <a2_0>Ibn Khafaja<a2_0/> in which he thanked Yusuf ibn Tashfin for the city's liberation.The declining power of the Almoravids coincided with the rise of a new dynasty in North Africa, the Almohads, who seized control of the peninsula from the year <a3_0>1145<a3_0/>, although their entry into Valencia was deterred by <a4_0>Ibn Mardanis<a4_0/>, King of Valencia and Murcia until 1171, at which time the city finally fell to the North Africans. The two Muslim dynasties would rule Valencia for more than a century."}
