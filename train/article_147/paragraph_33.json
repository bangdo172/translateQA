On 6 November 1936 the city became the capital of Republican Spain under the control of the prime minister <a0_0>Manuel Azana<a0_0/>; the government moved to the <a1_0>Palau de Benicarl\u00f3<a1_0/>, its ministries occupying various other buildings. The city was heavily bombarded by air and sea, necessitating the construction of <a2_0>over two hundred<a2_0/> bomb shelters to protect the population. On <a3_0>13 January 1937<a3_0/> the city was first shelled by a vessel of the Fascist Italian Navy, which was blockading the port by the order of Benito Mussolini. The bombardment intensified and inflicted massive destruction on several occasions; by the end of the war the city had survived 442 bombardments, leaving 2,831 dead and 847 wounded, although it is estimated that the death toll was higher, as the data given are those recognised by Francisco Franco's government. The Republican government passed to Juan Negr\u00edn on 17 May 1937 and on 31 October of that year moved to <a4_0>Barcelona<a4_0/>. On 30 March 1939 Valencia surrendered and the Nationalist troops entered the city. The postwar years were a time of hardship for Valencians. During Franco's regime speaking or teaching Valencian was prohibited; in a significant reversal it is now compulsory for every schoolchild in Valencia."}
