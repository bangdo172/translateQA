At the end of the 15th century this confraternity separated from the hospital, and continued its work under the name of \"<a1_0>Cofradia para el \u00e1mparo de los desamparados<a1_0/>\". King Philip IV of Spain and the Duke of Arcos suggested the building of the new chapel, and in 1647 the Viceroy, <a4_0>Conde de Oropesa<a4_0/>, who had been preserved from the bubonic plague, insisted on carrying out their project. The Blessed Virgin was proclaimed patroness of the city under the title of Virgen de los desamparados (Virgin of the Forsaken), and <a2_0>Archbishop Pedro de Urbina<a2_0/>, on 31 June 1652, laid the cornerstone of the new chapel of this name. The archiepiscopal palace, <a3_0>a grain market<a3_0/> in the time of the Moors, is simple in design, with an inside cloister and a handsome chapel. In 1357, the arch that connects it with the cathedral was built. In the council chamber are preserved the portraits of all the prelates of Valencia."}
