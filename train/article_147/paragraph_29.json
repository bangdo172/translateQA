Around 1870, the Valencian Renaissance, a movement committed to the revival of the Valencian language and traditions, began to gain ascendancy. In its early stages the movement inclined to the romanticism of the poet <a3_0>Teodor Llorente<a3_0/>, and resisted the more assertive remonstrances of <a2_0>Constantine Llombart<a2_0/>, founder of the still extant cultural society, <a1_0>Lo Rat Penat<a1_0/>, which is dedicated to the promotion and dissemination of the Valencian language and culture."}
