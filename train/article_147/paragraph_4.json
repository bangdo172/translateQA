English soldiers advanced as far as Requena on the road to Madrid. After the victory of the Bourbons at the <a1_0>Battle of Almansa<a1_0/> on 25 April 1707, the English army evacuated Valencia and <a2_0>Philip V<a2_0/> ordered the repeal of the privileges of Valencia as punishment for the kingdom's support of Charles of Austria. By the <a3_0>Nueva Planta decrees<a3_0/> (Decretos de Nueva Planta) the ancient Charters of Valencia were abolished and the city was governed by the Castilian Charter. The Bourbon forces burned important cities like Xativa, where pictures of the Spanish Bourbons in public places are hung upside down as a protest to this day. The capital of the Kingdom of Valencia was moved to Orihuela, an outrage to the citizens of Valencia. Philip ordered the Cortes to meet with the Viceroy of Valencia, <a4_0>Cardinal Luis de Belluga<a4_0/>, who opposed the change of capital because of the proximity of Orihuela, a religious, cultural and now political centre, to Murcia (capital of another viceroyalty and his diocese). Because of his hatred of the city of Orihuela, which had bombarded and looted Valencia during the War of Succession, the cardinal resigned the viceroyalty in protest against the actions of Philip, who finally relented and returned the capital to Valencia."}
