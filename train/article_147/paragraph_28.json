From 1609 through 1614, the Spanish government systematically forced Moriscos to leave the kingdom for Muslim <a2_0>North Africa<a2_0/>. They were concentrated in the former Kingdom of Aragon, where they constituted a fifth of the population, and the Valencia area specifically, where they were roughly <a3_0>a third<a3_0/> of the total population. The expulsion caused the financial ruin of some of the nobility and the bankruptcy of the Taula de Canvi in <a4_0>1613<a4_0/>. The Crown endeavoured to compensate the nobles, who had lost much of their agricultural labour force; this harmed the economy of the city for generations to come. Later, during the so-called Catalan Revolt (1640\u20131652), Valencia contributed to the cause of Philip IV with militias and money, resulting in a period of further economic hardship exacerbated by the arrival of troops from other parts of Spain."}
