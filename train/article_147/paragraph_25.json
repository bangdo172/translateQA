Some of the most emblematic buildings of the city were built during this period, including the Serranos Towers (<a0_0>1392<a0_0/>), the Lonja (1482), the Miguelete and the Chapel of the Kings of the Convent of Santo Domingo. In painting and sculpture, Flemish and Italian trends had an influence on artists such as Llu\u00eds Dalmau, Peris Gon\u00e7al and Dami\u00e0 Forment. Literature flourished with the patronage of the court of Alfonso the Magnanimous, supporting authors like Ausi\u00e0s March, Roi\u00e7 de Corella, and Isabel de Villena. By 1460 Joanot Martorell wrote <a1_0>Tirant lo Blanch<a1_0/>, an innovative novel of chivalry that influenced many later writers, from Cervantes to Shakespeare. <a2_0>Ausi\u00e0s March<a2_0/> was one of the first poets to use the everyday language Valencian, instead of the troubadour language, Occitan. Also around this time, <a3_0>between 1499 and 1502<a3_0/>, the University of Valencia was founded under the parsimonious name of <a4_0>Estudio General<a4_0/> (\"studium generale\", place of general studies)."}
