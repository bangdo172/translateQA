On the night of 23 February 1981, shortly after Antonio Tejero had stormed Congress, the Captain General of the Third Military Region, <a1_0>Jaime Milans del Bosch<a1_0/>, rose up in Valencia, put tanks on the streets, declared a state of emergency and tried to convince other senior military figures to support the coup.
