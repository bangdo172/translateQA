The Roman historian Florus says that Brutus transferred the soldiers who had fought under him to that province. This was a typical Roman city in its conception, as it was located in a strategic location near the sea on a river island crossed by the <a2_0>Via Augusta<a2_0/>, the imperial road that connected the province to Rome, the capital of the empire. The centre of the city was located in the present-day neighbourhood of the <a3_0>Plaza de la Virgen<a3_0/>. Here was the forum and the crossing of the <a4_0>Cardo Maximus and the Decumanus Maximus<a4_0/>, which remain the two main axes of the city. The Cardo corresponds to the existing Calle de Salvador, Almoina, and the Decumanus corresponds to Calle de los Caballeros."}
