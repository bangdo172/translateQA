Among his administrative acts he ordered the building of a luxurious palace, <a1_0>the Russafa<a1_0/>, on the outskirts of the city in the neighbourhood of the same name. So far no remains have been found. Also at this time Valencia received the name <a2_0>Medina al-Turab<a2_0/> (City of Sand). When Islamic culture settled in, Valencia, then called Balansiyya, prospered from the 10th century, due to a booming trade in paper, silk, leather, ceramics, glass and silver-work. The architectural legacy of this period is abundant in Valencia and can still be appreciated today in the remnants of the old walls, the Ba\u00f1os del Almirante bath house, Portal de Valldigna street and even the Cathedral and the tower, <a4_0>El Micalet<a4_0/> (El Miguelete), which was the minaret of the old mosque."}
