With the Byzantine invasion of the southwestern Iberian peninsula in <a0_0>554<a0_0/> the city acquired strategic importance. After the expulsion of the Byzantines in <a1_0>625<a1_0/>, <a4_0>Visigothic military contingents<a4_0/> were posted there and the ancient Roman amphitheatre was fortified. Little is known of its history for nearly a hundred years; although this period is only scarcely documented by archeology, excavations suggest that there was little development of the city.
