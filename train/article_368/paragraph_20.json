This process begins <b6_0>when a pollen grain adheres to <a1_0><b7_0>the stigma of the pistil<b7_0/><a1_0/> (female reproductive structure), germinates, and grows a long pollen tube<b6_0/>. While this pollen tube is growing, a <a2_0>haploid generative<a2_0/> cell travels down the tube behind the tube nucleus. The generative cell divides by mitosis to produce two haploid (n) sperm cells. As the pollen tube grows, it makes its way from the stigma, down the style and into the ovary. Here the pollen tube reaches the micropyle of the ovule and digests its way into <a3_0>one of the synergids<a3_0/>, releasing its contents (which include the sperm cells). <b8_0>The synergid<b8_0/> that the cells were released into degenerates and one sperm makes its way to fertilize the egg cell, producing a diploid (2n) zygote. The second sperm cell fuses with <b9_0>both central cell nuclei<b9_0/>, producing a triploid (3n) cell. As the zygote develops into an embryo, the triploid cell develops into the <a4_0>endosperm<a4_0/>, which serves as the embryo's food supply. The ovary now will develop into fruit and the ovule will develop into seed."}
