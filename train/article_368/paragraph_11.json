This included flowering plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules, distinguished from his Gymnospermae, or flowering plants with achenial or schizo-carpic fruits, the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as a seed and naked. The term and its antonym were maintained by <a2_0>Carl Linnaeus<a2_0/> <b8_0>with the same sense, but with restricted application, in the names of the orders of his class Didynamia<b8_0/>. Its use with any approach to its modern scope became possible only after 1827, when Robert Brown <b9_0>established the existence of truly <a3_0>naked ovules<a3_0/> in the Cycadeae and Coniferae, and applied to them the name Gymnosperms<b9_0/>.[citation needed] From that time onward, as long as these Gymnosperms were, as was usual, reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants, the term Angiosperm was used antithetically by botanical writers, with varying scope, as a group-name for <a4_0>other dicotyledonous plants<a4_0/>."}
