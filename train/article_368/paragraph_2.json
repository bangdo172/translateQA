However, the fossil record has considerably grown since the time of Darwin, and recently discovered <a1_0><b9_0>angiosperm<b9_0/><a1_0/> fossils such as Archaefructus, along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. Several groups of extinct gymnosperms, in particular seed ferns, have been proposed as <b6_0>the ancestors of flowering plants<b6_0/>, but there is no <b7_0>continuous fossil <a2_0>evidence<b7_0/> showing exactly how flowers evolved<a2_0/>. Some older fossils, such as the upper Triassic Sanmiguelia, have been suggested. Based on current evidence, some propose that the ancestors of the angiosperms diverged from an unknown group of gymnosperms in the Triassic period (245\u2013202 million years ago). Fossil angiosperm-like pollen from the <a3_0>Middle Triassic<a3_0/> (247.2\u2013242.0 Ma) suggests an older date for their origin. A close <a4_0>relationship between angiosperms and gnetophytes<a4_0/>, proposed on the basis of morphological evidence, has more recently been disputed <b8_0>on the basis of molecular evidence<b8_0/> that suggest gnetophytes are instead more closely related to other gymnosperms.[citation needed]"}
