Early land plants reproduced sexually <a1_0>with flagellated, swimming sperm<a1_0/>, like the green algae from which they evolved. An adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of <b9_0>upright meiosporangia<b9_0/> for dispersal by <a2_0>spores<a2_0/> to new habitats. This feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives, the <a3_0>Charophycean green algae<a3_0/>. A later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate, avascular sexual stage, the gametophyte, within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte. This occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release, as in non-seed plants. A current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in Selaginella, <a4_0>the spike-moss<a4_0/>. The result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case, the seed. The first seed bearing plants, like the ginkgo, and conifers (such as pines and firs), did not produce <b5_0>flowers<b5_0/>. The pollen grains (males) of Ginkgo and cycads produce <b6_0>a pair of flagellated, mobile sperm cells<b6_0/> that <b7_0>\"swim\" down the developing pollen tube<b7_0/> to the female and her eggs."}
