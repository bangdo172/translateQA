Other descriptive names allowed by Article 16 of the ICBN include <b2_0>Dicotyledones or Dicotyledoneae, and Monocotyledones or Monocotyledoneae<b2_0/>, which have a long history of use. In English a member of either group may be called a dicotyledon (plural dicotyledons) and monocotyledon (plural monocotyledons), or abbreviated, as dicot (plural dicots) and monocot (plural monocots). These names derive from the observation that the dicots most often have two <b0_0>cotyledons<b0_0/>, or embryonic leaves, within each seed. The monocots usually have only one, but the rule is not absolute either way. From a diagnostic point of view, the number of cotyledons is <b1_0>neither a particularly handy nor a reliable character<b1_0/>."}
