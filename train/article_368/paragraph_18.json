Usually, other structures are present and serve to protect <a1_0>the sporophylls<a1_0/> and to form <b5_0>an envelope<b5_0/> attractive to pollinators. The individual members of these surrounding structures are known as <a2_0>sepals and petals<a2_0/> (or tepals in flowers such as <b6_0>Magnolia<b6_0/> where sepals and petals are not distinguishable from each other). The outer series (calyx of sepals) is usually <a3_0>green and leaf-like<a3_0/>, and functions to protect <b7_0>the rest of the flower, especially the bud<b7_0/>. The inner series (corolla of petals) is, <b8_0>in general, white or brightly colored<b8_0/>, and is more delicate in structure. It functions to attract insect or bird pollinators. Attraction is effected by <b9_0>color, scent, and nectar<b9_0/>, which may be secreted in some part of the flower. The characteristics that attract pollinators account for the popularity of flowers and flowering plants among <a4_0>humans<a4_0/>."}
