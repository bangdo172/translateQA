In each bundle, separating the <a1_0>xylem and phloem<a1_0/>, is a layer of meristem or active formative tissue known as <a2_0>cambium<a2_0/>. By the formation of a layer of cambium between the bundles (interfascicular cambium), <b5_0>a complete ring<b5_0/> is formed, and a regular periodical <a3_0>increase in thickness<a3_0/> results from <b6_0>the development of xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside<b6_0/>. The soft phloem becomes crushed, but <b7_0>the hard wood persists and forms the bulk of the stem and branches of the woody perennial<b7_0/>.
