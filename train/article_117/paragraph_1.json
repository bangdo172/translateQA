Most significantly, respondents were given the option of selecting <a3_0>one or more<a3_0/> race categories to indicate racial identities. Data show that <a1_0>nearly seven million<a1_0/> Americans identified as members of two or more races. Because of these changes, the Census 2000 data on race are not directly comparable with data from the <a2_0>1990<a2_0/> census or earlier censuses. Use of caution is therefore recommended when interpreting changes in the racial composition of the US population over time."}
