Mexico protested, and <a2_0>Roosevelt<a2_0/> decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white. The State Department, the Census Bureau, the Labor Department, and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of <a3_0>Mexican<a3_0/> descent as white.
