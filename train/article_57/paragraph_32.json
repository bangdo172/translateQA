Though Universal did produce occasional hits, among them Airport (1970), The Sting (1973), American Graffiti (also 1973), <a2_0>Earthquake<a2_0/> (1974), and a big box-office success which restored the company's fortunes: Jaws (1975), Universal during the decade was primarily a television studio. When <b7_0>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer<b7_0/> purchased <a3_0>United Artists<a3_0/> in 1981, MGM could not drop out of the CIC venture to merge with United Artists overseas operations. However, with future film productions from both names being released through the MGM/UA Entertainment plate, CIC decided to merge UA's international units with MGM and reformed as United International Pictures. There would be other film hits like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Back to the Future (1985), Field of Dreams (1989), and Jurassic Park (1993), but the film business was financially unpredictable. UIP began distributing films by start-up studio DreamWorks in <a4_0>1997<a4_0/>, due to connections the founders have with Paramount, Universal, and Amblin Entertainment. In 2001, <b8_0>MGM<b8_0/> dropped out of the UIP venture, and went with <b9_0>20th Century Fox<b9_0/>'s international arm to handle distribution of their titles to this day."}
