Though neither could claim to be a big financial hit, both films received Academy Award nominations, and Anne was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (<a3_0>Richard Burton<a3_0/>), Best Actress (Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold), and Best Supporting Actor (Anthony Quayle). Wallis retired from Universal after making the film <a4_0><b9_0>Rooster Cogburn<b9_0/><a4_0/> (1975), a sequel to True Grit (1969), which Wallis had produced at Paramount. Rooster Cogburn co-starred John Wayne, reprising his Oscar-winning role from the earlier film, and Katharine Hepburn, their only film together. The film was only a moderate success."}
