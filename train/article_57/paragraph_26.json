While there were to be a few hits like The Killers (<a0_0>1946<a0_0/>) and The Naked City (1948), Universal-International's new theatrical films often met with disappointing response at the box office. By the late 1940s, <b5_0>Goetz<b5_0/> was out, and the studio returned to low-budget films. The inexpensive <a1_0>Francis<a1_0/> (<b7_0>1950<b7_0/>), the first film of a series about a talking mule and Ma and Pa Kettle (<a2_0><b6_0>1949<b6_0/><a2_0/>), part of a series, became mainstays of the company. Once again, the films of Abbott and Costello, including <a3_0><b8_0>Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein<b8_0/><a3_0/> (1948), were among the studio's top-grossing productions. But at this point Rank lost interest and sold his shares to the investor <a4_0>Milton Rackmil<a4_0/>, whose <b9_0>Decca Records<b9_0/> would take full control of Universal in 1952. Besides Abbott and Costello, the studio retained the Walter Lantz cartoon studio, whose product was released with Universal-International's films."}
