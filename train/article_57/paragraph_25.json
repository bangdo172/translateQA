Universal-International became responsible for the American distribution of Rank's British productions, including such classics as <a1_0>David Lean<a1_0/>'s Great Expectations (<b5_0>1946<b5_0/>) and Laurence Olivier's Hamlet (<a0_0><b6_0>1948<b6_0/><a0_0/>). Broadening its scope further, <b8_0>Universal-International<b8_0/> branched out into the lucrative non-theatrical field, buying a majority stake in home-movie dealer <a2_0><b7_0>Castle Films<b7_0/><a2_0/> in 1947, and taking the company over entirely in <a4_0>1951<a4_0/>. For three decades, Castle would offer \"highlights\" reels from the Universal film library to home-movie enthusiasts and collectors. Goetz licensed Universal's pre\u2013Universal-International film library to <a3_0>Jack Broeder<a3_0/>'s Realart Pictures for cinema re-release but Realart was not allowed to show the films on television."}
