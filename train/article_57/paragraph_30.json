The company reverted in name to <b6_0>Universal Pictures<b6_0/>. As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business, virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract. In <a4_0>1964<a4_0/> MCA formed <a1_0><b7_0>Universal City Studios, Inc.<b7_0/><a1_0/>, merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions (officially renamed as <a2_0><b8_0>Universal Television<b8_0/><a2_0/> in 1966). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a full-blown, A-film movie studio, with leading actors and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964. Television production made up much of the studio's output, with Universal heavily committed, in particular, to deals with <b9_0>NBC<b9_0/> (which later merged with Universal to form <a3_0>NBC Universal<a3_0/>; see below) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons. An innovation during this period championed by Universal was the made-for-television movie."}
