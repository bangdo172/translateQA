In June 1909, <b6_0>Laemmle<b6_0/> started the <a0_0><b7_0>Yankee Film Company<b7_0/><a0_0/> with partners <a1_0>Abe Stern and Julius Stern<a1_0/>. That company quickly evolved into the <b9_0>Independent Moving Pictures Company<b9_0/> (IMP), with studios in <a2_0>Fort Lee, New Jersey<a2_0/>, where many early films in America's first motion picture industry were produced in the early 20th century. Laemmle broke with Edison's custom of refusing to give billing and screen credits to performers. By naming the movie stars, he attracted many of the leading players of the time, contributing to the creation of the star system. In 1910, he promoted Florence Lawrence, formerly known as \"<a3_0><b8_0>The Biograph Girl<b8_0/><a3_0/>\", and actor <a4_0>King Baggot<a4_0/>, in what may be the first instance of a studio using stars in its marketing."}
