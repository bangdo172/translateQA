He bought and built theaters, converted the studio to sound production, and made several forays into high-quality production. His early efforts included the critically mauled part-talkie version of Edna Ferber's novel <a1_0><b5_0>Show Boat<b5_0/><a1_0/> (<a2_0>1929<a2_0/>), the lavish musical <b6_0>Broadway<b6_0/> (1929) which included Technicolor sequences; and the first all-color musical feature (for Universal), <a4_0><b7_0>King of Jazz<b7_0/><a4_0/> (1930).
