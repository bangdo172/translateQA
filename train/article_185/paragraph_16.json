The Copyright Directive was not intended to <a1_0><b6_0>legitimize file-sharing<b6_0/><a1_0/>, but rather the common practice of space shifting copyright-protected content from a legally purchased CD (for example) to certain kinds of devices and media, provided rights holders are compensated and no copy protection measures are circumvented. Rights-holder compensation takes various forms, depending on the country, but is generally either a levy on \"recording\" devices and media, or <a2_0>a <b7_0>tax on the content itself<b7_0/><a2_0/>. In some countries, such as <a3_0><b8_0>Canada<b8_0/><a3_0/>, the applicability of such laws to copying onto general-purpose storage devices like <a4_0><b9_0>computer hard drives, portable media players, and phones<b9_0/><a4_0/>, for which no levies are collected, has been the subject of debate and further efforts to reform copyright law."}
