These intermediaries may include the author, publishers and marketers of peer-to-peer networking software, and the websites that allow users to download such software. In the case of the <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0>BitTorrent<b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/> protocol, intermediaries may include the torrent tracker and any websites or search engines which facilitate access to torrent files. Torrent files don't contain <a2_0><b7_0>copyrighted content<b7_0/><a2_0/>, but they may make reference to files that do, and they may point to trackers which coordinate the sharing of those files. Some torrent indexing and search sites, such as <a3_0><b8_0>The Pirate Bay<b8_0/><a3_0/>, now encourage the use of magnet links, instead of direct links to torrent files, creating another layer of indirection; using such links, torrent files are obtained from other peers, rather than from a particular website."}
