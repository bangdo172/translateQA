In copyright law, infringement does not refer to theft of physical objects that take away the owner's possession, but an instance where a person exercises one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder without <a0_0><b5_0>authorization<b5_0/><a0_0/>. Courts have distinguished between <a1_0><b6_0>copyright infringement and theft<b6_0/><a1_0/>. For instance, the United States Supreme Court held in Dowling v. United States (1985) that bootleg phonorecords did not constitute stolen property. Instead, \"interference with copyright does not easily equate with <a2_0><b7_0>theft, conversion, or fraud<b7_0/><a2_0/>. <a3_0><b8_0>The Copyright Act<b8_0/><a3_0/> even employs a separate term of art to define one who misappropriates a copyright: '[...] an infringer of the copyright.'\" The court said that in the case of copyright infringement, the province guaranteed to the copyright holder by copyright law \u2013 <a4_0><b9_0>certain exclusive rights<b9_0/><a4_0/> \u2013 is invaded, but no control, physical or otherwise, is taken over the copyright, nor is the copyright holder wholly deprived of using the copyrighted work or exercising the exclusive rights held."}
