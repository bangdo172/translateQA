During the theatrical window, digital versions of films are often transported in data storage devices <a1_0><b6_0>by couriers<b6_0/><a1_0/> rather than by data transmission. The data can be <a2_0><b7_0>encrypted<b7_0/><a2_0/>, with the key being made to work only at specific times in order to prevent leakage between screens. Coded <a3_0><b8_0>Anti-Piracy marks can be added<b8_0/><a3_0/> to films to identify the source of illegal copies and shut them down. As a result of these measures, the only versions of films available for piracy during the theatrical window are usually <a4_0><b9_0>\"cams\" made by video recordings of the movie screens<b9_0/><a4_0/>, which are of inferior quality compared to the original film version."}
