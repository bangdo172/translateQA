For example, major motion-picture corporation MGM Studios filed suit against P2P file-sharing services <a1_0><b6_0>Grokster and Streamcast<b6_0/><a1_0/> for their contributory role in copyright infringement. In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of <a2_0><b7_0>MGM<b7_0/><a2_0/>, holding that such services could be held liable for copyright infringement since they functioned and, indeed, willfully marketed themselves as <a3_0><b8_0>venues for acquiring copyrighted movies<b8_0/><a3_0/>. The MGM v.
