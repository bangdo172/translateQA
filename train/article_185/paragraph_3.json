Prior to the Statute of Anne in 1710, the Stationers' Company of London in 1557, received a Royal Charter giving the company <b5_0>a <a0_0>monopoly on publication and tasking it with enforcing the charter<b5_0/><a0_0/>. Those who violated the charter were labelled pirates as early as 1603. The term \"piracy\" has been used to refer to the unauthorized copying, distribution and selling of works in copyright. Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works uses the term \"piracy\" <a1_0><b6_0>in relation to copyright infringement<b6_0/><a1_0/>, stating \"Pirated works may be <a2_0><b7_0>seized on importation<b7_0/><a2_0/> into those countries of the Union where the original work enjoys legal protection.\" Article 61 of the <a3_0><b8_0>1994<b8_0/><a3_0/> Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires criminal procedures and penalties in cases of \"willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale.\" Piracy traditionally refers to acts of copyright infringement intentionally committed for financial gain, though more recently, copyright holders have described online copyright infringement, particularly in relation to <a4_0><b9_0>peer-to-peer file sharing networks<b9_0/><a4_0/>, as \"piracy.\""}
