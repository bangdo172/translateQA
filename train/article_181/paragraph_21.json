These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time. After considering various options, in <a0_0>2000<a0_0/> Arsenal proposed building a new <b6_0>60,361<b6_0/>-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the <a1_0>Emirates Stadium<a1_0/>, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006\u201307 season. The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest <a4_0>sponsorship deal<a4_0/> in English football history, worth around <a2_0><b7_0>\u00a3100 million<b7_0/><a2_0/>; some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with <a3_0>corporate sponsorship<a3_0/> of stadium names. The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor until the end of the 2018\u201319 season. From the start of the 2010\u201311 season on, the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank, East Stand, West Stand and Clock end."}
