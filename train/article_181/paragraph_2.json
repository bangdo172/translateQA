The club was renamed again to Woolwich Arsenal after becoming a limited company in <a1_0>1893<a1_0/>. The club became the first southern member of the Football League in 1893, starting out in the Second Division, and won promotion to the First Division in 1904. The club's relative geographic isolation resulted in lower attendances than those of other clubs, which led to the club becoming mired in financial problems and effectively bankrupt by <b5_0>1910<b5_0/>, when they were taken over by businessmen <b8_0>Henry Norris and William Hall<b8_0/>. Norris sought to move the club elsewhere, and in <a2_0>1913<a2_0/>, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Arsenal moved to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, north London; they dropped \"Woolwich\" from their name the following year. Arsenal only finished in fifth place in the <a3_0>second division<a3_0/> during the last pre-war competitive season of 1914\u201315, but were nevertheless elected to rejoin the <a4_0>First Division<a4_0/> when competitive football resumed in 1919\u201320, at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Some books have reported that this election to division 1 was achieved by dubious means."}
