Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the <a2_0>white sleeves<a2_0/>. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf. Regardless of which story is true, the <a3_0>red and white<a3_0/> shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966\u201367, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005\u201306, the last season that Arsenal played at <b6_0>Highbury<b6_0/>, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their <a4_0>first season<a4_0/> in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season. In the 2008\u201309 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe."}
