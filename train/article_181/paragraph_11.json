For the first time, the crest was <a1_0>rendered in colour<a1_0/>, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming <b7_0>red, gold and green<b7_0/>. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to copyright it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a <a2_0>trademark<a2_0/>, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold \"unofficial\" Arsenal merchandise, Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in <a3_0><b8_0>2002<b8_0/><a3_0/> they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable. The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a sans-serif typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest was criticised by some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal's history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that <a4_0>fans<a4_0/> had not been properly consulted on the issue."}
