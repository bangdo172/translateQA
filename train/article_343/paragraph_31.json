Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called <a0_0><b3_0>teachers<b3_0/><a0_0/>, and they direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects like <a1_0><b4_0>reading, writing, mathematics, science and history<b4_0/><a1_0/>. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called teachers, instructors, or professors, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the <a2_0><b5_0>quality of teachers<b5_0/><a2_0/> is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible. With the passing of NCLB in the United States (<b7_0>No Child Left Behind<b7_0/>), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use <b6_0>student evaluations of teachers<b6_0/> (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias."}
