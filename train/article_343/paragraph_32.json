However, technology transfer <a2_0>requires <b6_0>knowledgeable managers and engineers<b6_0/><a2_0/> who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of \"human capital\". Recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions and the role of cognitive skills."}
