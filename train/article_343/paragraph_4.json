In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising. Under the Education For All programs driven by <a2_0>UNESCO<a2_0/>, <b6_0>most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment<b6_0/> in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The <b7_0>division between primary and secondary education<b7_0/> is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools. Primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools and junior school."}
