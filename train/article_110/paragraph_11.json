Gradually, the Gorkhas annexed Sirmour and Shimla. With the leadership of <a2_0><b7_0>Amar Singh Thapa<b7_0/><a2_0/>, Gorkhas laid siege to Kangra. They managed to defeat <a3_0>Sansar Chand Katoch, the ruler of Kangra,<a3_0/> in 1806 with the help of many provincial chiefs. However, Gurkhas could not capture Kangra fort which came under <b8_0>Maharaja Ranjeet Singh<b8_0/> in 1809. After the defeat, the Gurkhas began to expand towards the south of the state. However, Raja Ram Singh, Raja of Siba State managed to capture the fort of Siba from the remnants of Lahore Darbar in Samvat 1846, during the First Anglo-Sikh War. They came into direct conflict with the British along the tarai belt after which the British expelled them from the provinces of the Satluj. The British gradually emerged as the paramount power. In the revolt of <b9_0>1857<b9_0/>, or first Indian war of independence, arising from a number of grievances against the British, the people of the hill states were not as politically active as were those in other parts of the country. They and their rulers, with the exception of Bushahr, remained more or less inactive. Some, including the <a4_0>rulers of Chamba, Bilaspur, Bhagal and Dhami<a4_0/>, rendered help to the British government during the revolt."}
