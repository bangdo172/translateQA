This may be combined with bribery, for example demanding that a business should employ a relative of an official controlling regulations affecting the business. The most extreme example is when the entire state is inherited, as in North Korea or Syria. A lesser form might be in the Southern United States with Good ol' boys, where women and minorities are excluded. A milder form of cronyism is an \"<a2_0>old boy network<a2_0/>\", in which appointees to official positions are selected only from a closed and exclusive social network \u2013 such as the alumni of particular universities \u2013 instead of appointing the most competent candidate."}
