In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a <a0_0>mutual understanding<a0_0/>, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a \"fee\" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174): For the purpose of this Convention, \"corruption\" means requesting, offering, giving or <a1_0>accepting<a1_0/>, directly or <a2_0>indirect<a2_0/>ly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof."}
