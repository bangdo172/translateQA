This is one argument for <a2_0>privatization and deregulation<a2_0/>. Opponents of privatization see the argument as ideological. The argument that corruption necessarily follows from the opportunity is weakened by the existence of countries with low to non-existent corruption but large public sectors, like the <a3_0>Nordic<a3_0/> countries. These countries score high on the Ease of Doing Business Index, due to good and often simple regulations, and have <a4_0>rule of law<a4_0/> firmly established. Therefore, due to their lack of corruption in the first place, they can run large public sectors without inducing political corruption. Recent evidence that takes both the size of expenditures and regulatory complexity into account has found that high-income democracies with more expansive state sectors do indeed have higher levels of corruption."}
