Bribery requires <a1_0>two<a1_0/> participants: one to give the bribe, and one to take it.

In some countries the <a2_0>culture of corruption<a2_0/> extends to every aspect of public life, making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes. Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do. They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations.
