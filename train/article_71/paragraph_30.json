For example, suppose that a politician is in charge of choosing how to spend some public funds. He can give a contract to a company that is not the best <a1_0>bidder<a1_0/>, or allocate more than they deserve. In this case, the company benefits, and in exchange for betraying the public, the official receives a kickback payment, which is a portion of the sum the company received. This sum itself may be all or a portion of the difference between the actual (inflated) payment to the company and the (lower) market-based price that would have been paid had the bidding been competitive."}
