Like <b5_0>Jupiter and Saturn<b5_0/>, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of <a1_0><b6_0><b9_0>hydrogen and helium<b9_0/><b6_0/><a1_0/>, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of \"ices\" such as <a4_0><b12_0>water, ammonia, and methane<b12_0/><a4_0/>. However, its interior, like that of Uranus, is primarily composed of <a2_0><b10_0>ices and rock<b10_0/><a2_0/>, and hence Uranus and Neptune are normally considered \"ice giants\" to emphasise this distinction. Traces of <a3_0><b11_0>methane<b11_0/><a3_0/> in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's <b7_0>blue<b7_0/> appearance."}
