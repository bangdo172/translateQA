The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, <a3_0><b8_0>63,000 km<a3_0/> from the centre<b8_0/> of Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at <a4_0><b9_0>53,000 km<b9_0/><a4_0/>, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000 km. A faint outward extension to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000 km."}
