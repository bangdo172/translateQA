More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20 m/s in the easterly direction to 325 m/s westward. At the cloud tops, the prevailing winds range in speed from <a2_0><b7_0>400 m/s<b7_0/><a2_0/> along the equator to 250 m/s at the poles. Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction <a3_0><b8_0>opposite<b8_0/><a3_0/> the planet's rotation. The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a \"<a4_0><b9_0>skin effect<b9_0/><a4_0/>\" and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes. At 70\u00b0 S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300 m/s."}
