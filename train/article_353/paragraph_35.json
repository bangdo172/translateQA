Such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible at in the <a0_0>late <b5_0>2020s<b5_0/><a0_0/> or early 2030s. However, there have been a couple of discussions to launch Neptune missions sooner. In 2003, there was a proposal in NASA's \"Vision Missions Studies\" for a \"<a1_0>Neptune <b6_0>Orbiter with Probes<b6_0/><a1_0/>\" mission that does Cassini-level science. Another, more recent proposal was for <b7_0>Argo<b7_0/>, a flyby spacecraft to be launched in <a2_0>2019<a2_0/>, that would visit <a3_0><b8_0>Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and a Kuiper belt object<b8_0/><a3_0/>. The focus would be on Neptune and its largest moon Triton to be investigated around <a4_0><b9_0>2029<b9_0/><a4_0/>. The proposed New Horizons 2 mission (which was later scrapped) might also have done a close flyby of the Neptunian system."}
