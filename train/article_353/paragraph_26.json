The Kuiper belt is a ring of <a1_0><b6_0>small icy worlds<b6_0/><a1_0/>, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from <b8_0>Neptune's orbit<b8_0/> at <a2_0><b7_0>30 AU out to about 55 AU<b7_0/> from the Sun<a2_0/>. Much in the same way that Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so <a3_0>Neptune's gravity<a3_0/> dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating <a4_0><b9_0>gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure<b9_0/><a4_0/>. The region between 40 and 42 AU is an example."}
