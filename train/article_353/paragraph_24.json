Although Neptune lies over <a1_0><b6_0>50%<b6_0/><a1_0/> further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only <a2_0><b7_0>40%<b7_0/><a2_0/> its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (\u2212221.3 \u00b0C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (\u2212201.15 \u00b0C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about <a3_0><b8_0>2.61<b8_0/><a3_0/> times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, <b9_0>the <a4_0>heat left over<b9_0/> from Neptune's formation<a4_0/> may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets."}
