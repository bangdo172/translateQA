Of these, the <a2_0>irregularly shaped<a2_0/> <a1_0><b6_0>Proteus<b6_0/><a1_0/> is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical <b7_0>shape<b7_0/> by its own gravity. Although the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only 0.25% the mass of Triton. Neptune's innermost four moons\u2014<a3_0><b8_0>Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea<b8_0/><a3_0/>\u2014orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. The next-farthest out, <b9_0>Larissa<b9_0/>, was originally discovered in <a4_0>1981<a4_0/> when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when Voyager 2 observed Neptune in 1989, Larissa was found to have caused it. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004. A new moon and the smallest yet, S/2004 N 1, was found in 2013. Because Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, Neptune's moons have been named after lesser sea gods."}
