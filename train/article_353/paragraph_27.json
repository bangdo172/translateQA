These resonances occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over <a1_0><b6_0>200<b6_0/><a1_0/> known objects, is the <a0_0><b5_0><b9_0>2:3<b9_0/> resonance<b5_0/><a0_0/>. Objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known Kuiper belt objects, Pluto, is among them. Although <a2_0><b7_0>Pluto<b7_0/><a2_0/> crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the <a3_0>2:3<a3_0/> resonance ensures they can never collide. The <a4_0><b8_0>3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5<b8_0/><a4_0/> resonances are less populated."}
