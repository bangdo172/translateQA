However, in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the planet's name was translated as \"<a0_0><b5_0><b9_0>sea king star<b9_0/><b5_0/><a0_0/>\" (\u6d77\u738b\u661f), because Neptune was the <a1_0>god of the sea<a1_0/>. In Mongolian, Neptune is called <a2_0><b11_0><b12_0>Dalain Van<b12_0/><b11_0/><a2_0/> (\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d \u0432\u0430\u043d), reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the sea. In modern Greek the planet is called <a3_0><b8_0><b10_0>Poseidon<b10_0/><b8_0/><a3_0/> (\u03a0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2, Poseidonas), the Greek counterpart of Neptune. In Hebrew, \"<a4_0><b13_0>Rahab<b13_0/><a4_0/>\" (\u05e8\u05d4\u05d1), from a Biblical sea monster mentioned in the <b6_0>Book of Psalms<b6_0/>, was selected in a vote managed by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 2009 as the official name for the planet, even though the existing Latin term \"Neptun\" (\u05e0\u05e4\u05d8\u05d5\u05df) is commonly used. In M\u0101ori, the planet is called Tangaroa, named after the M\u0101ori god of the sea. In Nahuatl, the planet is called Tl\u0101locc\u012btlalli, named after the rain god <b7_0>Tl\u0101loc<b7_0/>."}
