This fluid, which has a high <a2_0><b12_0>electrical<b12_0/><a2_0/> conductivity, is sometimes called a water\u2013ammonia ocean. The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice. At a depth of <a3_0><b13_0>7000 km<b13_0/><a3_0/>, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into <a4_0><b8_0><b14_0>diamond crystals<b14_0/><a4_0/> that rain<b8_0/> downwards like hailstones. Very-high-pressure experiments at the <b9_0>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory<b9_0/> suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'."}
