On both occasions, <a0_0><b6_0>Galileo<b6_0/><a0_0/> seems to have mistaken <b11_0>Neptune<b11_0/> for <a1_0>a fixed star<a1_0/> when it appeared close\u2014in conjunction\u2014to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when <a2_0><b12_0>Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet<b12_0/><a2_0/>. Because <b9_0>Neptune<b9_0/> was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist <a4_0><b8_0><b14_0>David Jamieson<b14_0/><b8_0/><a4_0/> announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars."}
