Before Voyager 2's arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that <a2_0><b7_0>Uranus's<b7_0/><a2_0/> tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. In comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of <a3_0><b8_0>flows in the planets' interiors<a3_0/>.<b8_0/> This field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting liquids (probably a combination of <a4_0><b9_0>ammonia, methane and water<b9_0/><a4_0/>) resulting in a dynamo action."}
