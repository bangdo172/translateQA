Unexpected <b6_0>changes in the orbit of Uranus<b6_0/> led <a1_0><b7_0><b11_0>Alexis Bouvard<b11_0/><b7_0/><a1_0/> to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on <a2_0><b12_0>23 September 1846<b12_0/><a2_0/> by <b8_0>Johann Galle<b8_0/> within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, <a3_0><b13_0>Triton<b13_0/><a3_0/>, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by <a4_0><b14_0>Voyager 2<b14_0/><a4_0/>, when it flew by the planet on <b9_0>25 August 1989<b9_0/>. The advent of Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar."}
