Macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts aggregate to form granulomas, with <a1_0>lymphocytes<a1_0/> surrounding the infected <b5_0>macrophages<b5_0/>. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form <b6_0>a giant <a2_0>multinucleated<a2_0/> cell<b6_0/> in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system. However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the <b7_0>granulomas<b7_0/> to avoid destruction by the host's immune system. <b8_0>Macrophages and dendritic<b8_0/> cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the <a4_0>immune response<a4_0/> is suppressed. Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death (<a3_0>necrosis<a3_0/>) in the center of tubercles. To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, white cheese and is termed <b9_0>caseous necrosis<b9_0/>."}
