He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in <a1_0>1905<a1_0/> for this discovery. Koch did not believe the bovine (cattle) and <b6_0>human tuberculosis<b6_0/> diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected <a2_0>milk<a2_0/> as a source of infection. Later, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced by the invention of the pasteurization process. Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a \"remedy\" for tuberculosis in <b7_0>1890<b7_0/>, calling it \"<a3_0><b8_0>tuberculin<b8_0/><a3_0/>\". While it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis. The <a4_0>World Tuberculosis Day<a4_0/> was established on 24 March for this reason."}
