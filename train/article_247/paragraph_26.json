Commercial treatment-providers may at times overprescribe second-line drugs as well as supplementary treatment, promoting demands for further <a4_0>regulations<a4_0/>. The government of <a1_0>Brazil<a1_0/> provides universal TB-care, which reduces this problem. Conversely, falling rates of TB-infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates, but may be tied to increased level of education, income and health of the population. Costs of the disease, as calculated by the <a2_0>World Bank<a2_0/> in 2009 may exceed 150 billion USD per year in \"high burden\" countries. Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up \u2013 as among the 250M <a3_0>rural migrants<a3_0/> in China."}
