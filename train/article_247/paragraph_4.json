The high <a0_0>lipid<a0_0/> content of this pathogen accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics. It divides <b8_0>every <a3_0>16 to 20 hours<b8_0/><a3_0/>, which is an extremely <a1_0>slow<a1_0/> rate compared with other bacteria, which usually divide in <a4_0>less than an hour<a4_0/>. Mycobacteria have an outer membrane lipid bilayer. If a Gram stain is performed, MTB either stains very weakly \"Gram-positive\" or does not retain dye as a result of the high lipid and mycolic acid content of its cell wall. MTB can withstand weak disinfectants and survive in a dry state for <b6_0>weeks<b6_0/>. In nature, the bacterium can grow only within the cells of <a2_0>a host organism<a2_0/>, but <b7_0>M. tuberculosis<b7_0/> can be cultured in the laboratory."}
