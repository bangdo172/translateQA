About <a2_0><b6_0>10%<b6_0/><a2_0/> of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about <b9_0>half<b9_0/> of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, <a4_0>fever<a4_0/>, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \"<a3_0>consumption<a3_0/>\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms."}
