These are collectively denoted as \"<a0_0>extrapulmonary tuberculosis<a0_0/>\". Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in immunosuppressed persons and <a2_0>young children<a2_0/>. In those with HIV, this occurs in more than <a1_0>50%<a1_0/> of cases. Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura (in tuberculous pleurisy), the central nervous system (in <a3_0>tuberculous meningitis<a3_0/>), the lymphatic system (in scrofula of the neck), the genitourinary system (in urogenital tuberculosis), and the bones and joints (in Pott disease of the spine), among others. When it spreads to the bones, it is also known as \"osseous tuberculosis\", a form of <b8_0>osteomyelitis<b8_0/>. Sometimes, bursting of <b6_0>a tubercular abscess through skin<b6_0/> results in tuberculous ulcer. An ulcer originating from nearby infected lymph nodes is painless, slowly enlarging and has an appearance of \"<b7_0>wash leather<b7_0/>\". A potentially more serious, widespread form of TB is called \"disseminated tuberculosis\", also known as <a4_0>miliary tuberculosis<a4_0/>. Miliary TB makes up about <b9_0>10%<b9_0/> of extrapulmonary cases."}
