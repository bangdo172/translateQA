The two antibiotics most commonly used are <b7_0>isoniazid and <a1_0>rifampicin<b7_0/><a1_0/>, and treatments can be prolonged, taking <b8_0>several months<b8_0/>. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing <a2_0>antibiotic resistance<a2_0/>.

The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is poor. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment do, however, appear effective."}
