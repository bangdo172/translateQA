During this process, the <b8_0>bacterium<b8_0/> is enveloped by the macrophage and stored temporarily in a membrane-bound vesicle called a <a4_0>phagosome<a4_0/>. The <b9_0>phagosome<b9_0/> then combines with a lysosome to create <a2_0>a phagolysosome<a2_0/>. In the phagolysosome, the cell attempts to use reactive oxygen species and acid to kill the bacterium. However, M. tuberculosis has a thick, waxy <a3_0>mycolic acid capsule<a3_0/> that protects it from these toxic substances. M. tuberculosis is able to reproduce inside the macrophage and will eventually kill the immune cell."}
