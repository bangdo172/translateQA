Those who have been previously immunized may have a <a0_0><b6_0>false-positive<b6_0/><a0_0/> test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. <a1_0>Interferon gamma release assays<a1_0/> (<a3_0><b8_0>IGRAs<b8_0/><a3_0/>), on a <a4_0>blood<a4_0/> sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental <b7_0>mycobacteria<b7_0/>, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii.
