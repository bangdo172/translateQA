Transmission should occur from only people with active TB \u2013 those with <b7_0>latent<b7_0/> infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (\"<a4_0>overt<a4_0/>\") TB and putting them on <b8_0>anti-TB<b8_0/> drug regimens. After about <a2_0>two weeks<a2_0/> of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others.
