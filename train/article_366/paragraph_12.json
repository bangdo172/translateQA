In <a1_0><b5_0>Federalist No. 43<b5_0/><a1_0/> of The Federalist Papers, <a0_0><b4_0>James Madison<b4_0/><a0_0/> considered the implications of the definition of the \"seat of government\" found in the United States Constitution. Although he noted potential conflicts of interest, and the need for a \"municipal legislature for local purposes,\" Madison did not address the district's role in national voting. Legal scholars disagree on whether a simple act of <b8_0>Congress<b8_0/> can admit the District as a state, due to its status as the seat of government of the United States, which Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution requires to be under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress; depending on the interpretation of this text, admission of the full District as a state may require a Constitutional amendment, which is much more difficult to enact. However, <a2_0><b6_0>the Constitution does not set a minimum size<b6_0/> for the District<a2_0/>. Its size has already changed once before, when <a3_0><b7_0>Virginia reclaimed the portion of the District south of the Potomac<b7_0/><a3_0/>. So the constitutional requirement for a federal district can be satisfied by reducing its size to the small central core of government buildings and monuments, giving the rest of the territory to the new state."}
