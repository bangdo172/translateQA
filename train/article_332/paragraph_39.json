For example, when Hayek visited <a1_0>Venezuela<a1_0/> in May 1981, he was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America. In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism,\" and said that he was unaware of \"any <a2_0>totalitarian governments<a2_0/> in Latin America. The only one was Chile under Allende\". For Hayek, however, the word 'totalitarian' signifies something very specific: <a3_0>the want to \u201corganize the whole of society\u201d to attain a \u201cdefinite social goal\u201d<a3_0/> \u2014which is stark in contrast to \u201cliberalism and individualism\u201d."}
