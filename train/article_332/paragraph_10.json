It was written between 1940 and 1943. The title was inspired by the French classical liberal thinker <a1_0>Alexis de Tocqueville<a1_0/>'s writings on the \"road to servitude.\" It was first published in Britain by Routledge in <a2_0>March 1944<a2_0/> and was quite popular, leading Hayek to call it \"that unobtainable book,\" also due in part to wartime paper rationing. When it was published in the <a3_0>United States<a3_0/> by the University of Chicago in September of that year, it achieved greater popularity than in Britain. At the arrangement of editor <a4_0>Max Eastman<a4_0/>, the American magazine Reader's Digest also published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling The Road to Serfdom to reach a far wider audience than academics. The book is widely popular among those advocating individualism and classical liberalism."}
