Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after <a0_0>Kenneth Arrow<a0_0/>) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics, which is particularly striking since his own lecture was critical of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation. A number of Nobel Laureates in economics, such as Vernon Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist. Another Nobel winner, <a1_0>Paul Samuelson<a1_0/>, believed that Hayek was worthy of his award but nevertheless claimed that \"there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last half of the twentieth century economist fraternity. In 1931, <a3_0>Hayek's<a3_0/> <a4_0>Prices and Production<a4_0/> had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927\u20131931 (and the 1931\u20132007) historical scene\". Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher, <a2_0>Joseph Schumpeter<a2_0/>, to have been wrong on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy."}
