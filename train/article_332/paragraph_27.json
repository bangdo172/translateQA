He contrasted the use of the price mechanism with <a1_0>central planning<a1_0/>, arguing that the former allows for more rapid adaptation to changes in particular circumstances of time and place. Thus, he set the stage for <a2_0>Oliver Williamson<a2_0/>'s later contrast between markets and hierarchies as alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions. He used the term catallaxy to describe a \"self-organizing system of voluntary co-operation\". Hayek's research into this argument was specifically cited by the Nobel Committee in its press release awarding Hayek <a3_0>the Nobel prize<a3_0/>."}
