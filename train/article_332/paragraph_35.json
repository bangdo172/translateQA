Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders, and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind. On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits <a4_0>our ability to manipulate nature<a4_0/>. Since humans rely on the ecosystem to sustain themselves, we have a <a1_0>prima facie<a1_0/> obligation to not disrupt such systems. This analysis of ecosystems as <a2_0>spontaneous orders<a2_0/> does not rely on markets qualifying as spontaneous orders. As such, one need not endorse Hayek\u2019s <a3_0>analysis of markets<a3_0/> to endorse ecosystems as spontaneous orders."}
