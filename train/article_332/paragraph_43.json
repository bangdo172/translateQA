In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated, \"I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps <a1_0>Alfred Tarski<a1_0/>.\" (See Hacohen, 2000). Popper dedicated his <a2_0>Conjectures and Refutations<a2_0/> to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, to Popper and, in 1982, said that \"ever since his <a3_0>Logik der Forschung<a3_0/> first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology\". Popper also participated in <a4_0>the inaugural meeting<a4_0/> of the Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration, however, do not change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas."}
