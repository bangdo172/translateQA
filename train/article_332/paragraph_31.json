In his philosophy of science, which has much in common with that of his good friend <a2_0>Karl Popper<a2_0/>, Hayek was highly critical of what he termed <a3_0>scientism<a3_0/>: a false understanding of the methods of science that has been mistakenly forced upon the social sciences, but that is contrary to the practices of genuine science.
