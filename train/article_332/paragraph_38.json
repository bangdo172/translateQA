But a dictatorship may be a necessary system for <a0_0>a transitional period<a0_0/>. [...] Personally I prefer <a1_0>a liberal dictatorship<a1_0/> to democratic government devoid of liberalism. My personal impression \u2013 and this is valid for South America \u2013 is that in Chile, for example, we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to <a2_0>a liberal government<a2_0/>.\" In a letter to the London Times, he defended the Pinochet regime and said that he had \"not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under <a3_0>Pinochet<a3_0/> than it had been under Allende.\" Hayek admitted that \"it is not very likely that this will succeed, even if, at a particular point in time, it may be the only hope there is.\", he explained, however, \"It is not certain hope, because it will always depend on the goodwill of an individual, and there are very few individuals one can trust. But if it is the sole opportunity which exists at a particular moment it may be the best solution despite this. And only if and when the dictatorial government is visibly directing its steps towards limited democracy\"."}
