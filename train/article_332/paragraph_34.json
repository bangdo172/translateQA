He compared the market to a game in which '<a1_0>there is no point in calling the outcome just or unjust<a1_0/>' and argued that 'social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content'; likewise \"<a2_0>the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable<a2_0/>, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning\". He generally regarded government redistribution of income or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom: \"the principle of distributive justice, once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it. This would produce a kind of society which in all essential respects would be <a3_0>the opposite of a free society<a3_0/>.\""}
