He argues in favour of a society organised around <a1_0>a market order<a1_0/>, in which the apparatus of state is employed almost (though not entirely) exclusively <a2_0>to enforce the legal order<a2_0/> (consisting of abstract rules, and not particular commands) necessary for a market of free individuals to function. These ideas were informed by a moral philosophy derived from epistemological concerns regarding the inherent limits of human knowledge. Hayek argued that his ideal individualistic, free-market polity <a3_0>would be self-regulating<a3_0/> to such a degree that it would be 'a society which does not depend for its functioning on our finding <a4_0>good men<a4_0/> for running it'."}
