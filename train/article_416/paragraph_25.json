Radical Reformer, Andreas von Bodenstein Karlstadt, for example, referred to the Lutheran theologians at Wittenberg as the \"<a1_0>new papists<a1_0/>\". Since the term \"magister\" also means \"<a2_0>teacher<a2_0/>\", the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher. This is made evident in the prominence of Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry. Because of their authority, they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the <a3_0>Roman Popes<a3_0/>. A more political side of the Radical Reformation can be seen in the thought and practice of Hans Hut, although typically <a4_0>Anabaptism<a4_0/> has been associated with pacifism."}
