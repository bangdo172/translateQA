That means that they are allowed to explore God's creation and, according to Genesis 2:15, make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way. Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the humanities and the sciences. Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers, in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ, are to follow God's commandments. <a0_0>Industry, frugality, calling, discipline, and a strong sense of responsibility<a0_0/> are at the heart of their moral code. In particular, Calvin rejected <a1_0>luxury<a1_0/>. Therefore, craftsmen, industrialists, and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology. As a result, productivity grew, which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages. In this way, the economy, the sciences, and technology reinforced each other. The chance to participate in the <a2_0>economic success<a2_0/> of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors. The <a3_0>Protestant<a3_0/> work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution. This idea is also known as the \"<a4_0>Protestant ethic thesis<a4_0/>.\""}
