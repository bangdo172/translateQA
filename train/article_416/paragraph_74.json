Since 1900, Protestantism has spread rapidly in <a0_0>Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America<a0_0/>. That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion. Much of the growth has occurred <a1_0>after World War II<a1_0/>, when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred. According to one source, Protestants constituted respectively 2.5%, 2%, 0.5% of Latin Americans, Africans and Asians. In 2000, percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17%, more than 27% and 5.5%, respectively. According to Mark A. Noll, <a2_0>79%<a2_0/> of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910, while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth. By 2010, <a3_0>59%<a3_0/> of Anglicans were found in Africa. In 2010, more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany, while Protestants in <a4_0>Brazil<a4_0/> accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined. Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe. China is home to world's largest Protestant minority.[af]"}
