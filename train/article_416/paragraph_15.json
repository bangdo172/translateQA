Reformers in the Church of England alternated between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (via media) between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions. The English Reformation followed a particular course. The different character of the English Reformation came primarily from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII. <a2_0>King Henry<a2_0/> decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In <a1_0>1534<a1_0/>, the Act of Supremacy recognized Henry as the only Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England. <a4_0>Between 1535 and 1540<a4_0/>, under Thomas Cromwell, the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary I, a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I. <a3_0>The Elizabethan Religious Settlement<a3_0/> largely formed Anglicanism into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other. It was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the 17th century."}
