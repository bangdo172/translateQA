Zwingli was a scholar and preacher, who in 1518 moved to Zurich. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between <a1_0>the German states and the Swiss Confederation<a1_0/> led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German <a3_0>Prince Philip of Hesse<a3_0/> saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as <a2_0>the Colloquy of Marburg<a2_0/>, which has become infamous for <a4_0>its failure<a4_0/>. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine."}
