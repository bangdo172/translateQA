Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle (<a0_0>doctrine of the two kingdoms<a0_0/>). The believers were obliged to use <a4_0>reason<a4_0/> to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way. Luther's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably. The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture; <a1_0>1523<a1_0/>). <a2_0>Calvin<a2_0/> strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen (church elders, presbyters) in his representative church government. <a3_0>The Huguenots<a3_0/> added regional synods and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government. This system was taken over by the other reformed churches."}
