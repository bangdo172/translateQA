Lutheranism spread from <a0_0>Germany<a0_0/> into its surrounding areas,[c] Denmark,[d] Norway,[e] Sweden,[f] Finland,[g] Prussia,[h] Latvia,[i], Estonia,[j] and Iceland,[k] as well as other smaller territories. Reformed churches were founded primarily in Germany and its adjacent regions,[l] Hungary,[m] the Netherlands,[n] Scotland,[o] Switzerland,[p] and France[q] by such reformers as <a1_0>John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and John Knox<a1_0/>. Arminianism[r] gained supporters in <a2_0>the Netherlands and parts of Germany<a2_0/>. In 1534, <a3_0>King Henry VIII<a3_0/> put an end to all papal jurisdiction in England[s] after the Pope failed to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon; this opened the door to reformational ideas, notably during the following reign of Edward VI, through Thomas Cranmer, Richard Hooker, Matthew Parker and other theologians. There were also reformational efforts throughout continental Europe known as the Radical Reformation\u2014a response to perceived corruption in both the Roman Catholic Church and the expanding Magisterial Reformation led by Luther and various other reformers\u2014which gave rise to Anabaptist, Moravian, and other Pietistic movements. In later centuries, <a4_0>Protestants<a4_0/> developed their own culture, which made major contributions in education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy and the arts, and other fields."}
