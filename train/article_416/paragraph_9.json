In <a1_0>the early 1170s<a1_0/>, Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians. He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church. By <a2_0>1215<a2_0/>, the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution. Despite that, the movement continues to exist to this day in <a3_0>Italy<a3_0/>, as a part of the wider Reformed tradition."}
