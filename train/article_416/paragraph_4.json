The word evangelical (<a0_0>German<a0_0/>: <a1_0>evangelisch<a1_0/>), which refers to the gospel, was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement. Nowadays, this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations, above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD. The German word evangelisch means Protestant, and is different from the German evangelikal, which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism. The English word <a2_0>evangelical<a2_0/> usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches, and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole. It traces its roots back to <a4_0>the Puritans<a4_0/> in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States. The word reformatorisch is used as an alternative for evangelisch in German, and is different from English reformed (German: reformiert), which refers to churches shaped by ideas of <a3_0>John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli<a3_0/> and other Reformed theologians."}
