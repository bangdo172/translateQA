Its origins lay in the recognition of the need for cooperation on the mission field in Africa, Asia and Oceania. Since 1948, <a0_0>the World Council of Churches<a0_0/> has been influential, but ineffective in creating a united church. There are also ecumenical bodies at regional, national and local levels across the globe; but schisms still far outnumber unifications. One, but not the only expression of the ecumenical movement, has been the move to form <a4_0>united churches<a4_0/>, such as the Church of South India, the Church of North India, the US-based United Church of Christ, the United Church of Canada, the Uniting Church in Australia and the United Church of Christ in the Philippines which have rapidly declining memberships. There has been a strong engagement of <a2_0>Orthodox<a2_0/> churches in the ecumenical movement, though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of <a3_0>watering down Orthodox doctrine<a3_0/>."}
