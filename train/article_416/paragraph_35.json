In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults. Baptist practice spread to England, where the <a2_0>General Baptists<a2_0/> considered Christ's atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. In 1638, <a3_0>Roger Williams<a3_0/> established the first Baptist congregation in the North American colonies. In the mid-18th century, the First Great Awakening increased Baptist growth in both New England and the South. The Second Great Awakening in the South in the early 19th century increased church membership, as did the preachers' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery, which had been part of the 18th-century teachings. <a4_0>Baptist missionaries<a4_0/> have spread their church to every continent."}
