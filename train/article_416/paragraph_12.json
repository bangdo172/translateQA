After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526, and the unsuccessful attempts of the Bern reformer William Farel, Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the \"fallen city\" of Geneva. His Ordinances of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559, <a2_0>Geneva<a2_0/> became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as <a3_0>Calvinist<a3_0/> missionaries. The faith continued to spread after Calvin's death in <a4_0>1563<a4_0/>."}
