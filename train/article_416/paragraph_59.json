He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\" Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, <a2_0>Calvin<a2_0/> suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (<a1_0>separation of powers<a1_0/>). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy. Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like <a4_0>Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle<a4_0/>. <a3_0>Hugo Grotius<a3_0/> was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible."}
