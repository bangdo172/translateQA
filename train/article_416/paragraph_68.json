The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of <a2_0>the five solas<a2_0/> and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century <a0_0>Conciliar<a0_0/> movement, rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, <a3_0>the Council of Trent<a3_0/>. Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of <a4_0>invisible<a4_0/> character, wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ, not common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative action."}
