Sprung from <a1_0>Methodist and Wesleyan<a1_0/> roots, it arose out of meetings at an <a4_0>urban<a4_0/> mission on Azusa Street in <a3_0>Los Angeles<a3_0/>. From there it spread around the world, carried by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there. These Pentecost-like manifestations have steadily been in evidence throughout the history, such as seen in the two Great Awakenings. Pentecostalism, which in turn birthed <a2_0>the Charismatic movement<a2_0/> within already established denominations, continues to be an important force in Western Christianity."}
