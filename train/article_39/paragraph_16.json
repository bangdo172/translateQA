The centerpiece of downtown is the newly renovated <a0_0>Crystal Bridge and Myriad Botanical Gardens<a0_0/>, one of the few elements of the Pei Plan to be completed. In the next few years a massive new central park will link the gardens near the CBD and the new convention center to be built just south of it to the North Canadian River, as part of a massive works project known as Core to Shore; the new park is part of MAPS3, a collection of civic projects funded by a 1-cent temporary (seven-year) sales tax increase."}
