The latewood will be <a1_0>denser<a1_0/> than that formed early in the season. When examined under a microscope the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with <a4_0>very small<a4_0/> cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have <a3_0>thin<a3_0/> walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the <a2_0>walls<a2_0/>, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion and nature of the latewood in the ring."}
