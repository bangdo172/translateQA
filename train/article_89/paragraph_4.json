This process is known as <a2_0>secondary growth<a2_0/>; it is the result of cell division in the vascular cambium, a lateral meristem, and subsequent expansion of the new cells. Where there are clear <a3_0>seasons<a3_0/>, growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern, leading to growth rings; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log, but are also visible on the other surfaces. If these seasons are annual these growth rings are referred to as <a4_0>annual rings<a4_0/>. Where there is no seasonal difference growth rings are likely to be indistinct or absent."}
