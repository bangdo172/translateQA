The wood from conifers (e.g. pine) is called <a0_0>softwood<a0_0/>, and the wood from <a4_0>dicotyledons<a4_0/> (usually broad-leaved trees, e.g. oak) is called <a1_0>hardwood<a1_0/>. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a <a2_0>hardwood<a2_0/>) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. <a3_0>yew<a3_0/>) are harder than many hardwoods."}
