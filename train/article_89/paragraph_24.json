The black check in western hemlock is the result of <a2_0>insect attacks<a2_0/>. The reddish-brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by <a3_0>birds<a3_0/>. The discoloration is merely an indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain rot-producing fungi impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness; however an attractive effect known as <a4_0>spalting<a4_0/> produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect."}
