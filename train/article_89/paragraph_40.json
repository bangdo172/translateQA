As the <a1_0>breadth of ring<a1_0/> diminishes, this latewood is reduced so that very <a2_0>slow<a2_0/> growth produces comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In <a3_0>good<a3_0/> oak these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of <a4_0>thick-walled<a4_0/> fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth."}
