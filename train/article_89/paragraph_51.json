Next in abundance is <a2_0>hemicellulose<a2_0/>, which is around 20% in deciduous trees but near 30% in <a3_0>conifers<a3_0/>. It is mainly five-carbon sugars that are linked in an irregular manner, in contrast to the cellulose. Lignin is the third component at around 27% in coniferous wood vs. 23% in deciduous trees. Lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting the fact that it is based on aromatic rings. These three components are interwoven, and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose. A major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the <a4_0>cellulose<a4_0/>, from which paper is made."}
