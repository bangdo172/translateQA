Such resin-saturated heartwood is called \"<a1_0>fat lighter<a1_0/>\". Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to <a2_0>rot<a2_0/> and termites; however they are very flammable. Stumps of old longleaf pines are often dug, split into small pieces and sold as <a4_0>kindling<a4_0/> for fires. Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut. Spruce impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in <a3_0>strength<a3_0/> thereby."}
