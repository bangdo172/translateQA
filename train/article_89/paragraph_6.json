In a <a2_0>longitudinally<a2_0/> sawn plank, a knot will appear as a roughly circular \"solid\" (usually <a3_0>darker<a3_0/>) piece of wood around which the grain of the rest of the wood \"flows\" (parts and rejoins). Within a knot, the direction of the wood (grain direction) is up to <a4_0>90<a4_0/> degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood."}
