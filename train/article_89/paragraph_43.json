The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not the same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the <a3_0>conifers<a3_0/>. In general it may be stated that such woods of <a1_0>medium<a1_0/> growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is <a4_0>little<a4_0/> contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next."}
