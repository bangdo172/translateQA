Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; <a2_0>density<a2_0/> is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per millilitre (g/cm3 or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density <a3_0>increases<a3_0/>. Minimum values are associated with green (<a4_0>water-saturated<a4_0/>) wood and are referred to as basic specific gravity (Timell 1986)."}
