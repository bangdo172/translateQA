In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the <a2_0>sapwood<a2_0/>, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness to equally sound <a1_0>heartwood<a1_0/> from the same log.
