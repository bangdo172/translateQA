Of these, <a2_0>bamboo<a2_0/>, botanically a member of the <a3_0>grass<a3_0/> family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material in their own right and, these days, in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and veneer. Another major plant group that produce material that often is called wood are the <a4_0>palms<a4_0/>. Of much less importance are plants such as Pandanus, Dracaena and Cordyline. With all this material, the structure and composition of the structural material is quite different from ordinary wood."}
