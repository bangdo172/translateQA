The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become <a1_0>narrower<a1_0/> and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its <a2_0>crown<a2_0/> becomes more open and the annual wood production is <a3_0>lessened<a3_0/>, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for <a4_0>light<a4_0/> and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern oaks, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases."}
