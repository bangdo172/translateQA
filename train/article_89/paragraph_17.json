No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently, the sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown tree, will be freer from knots than the inner <a2_0>heartwood<a2_0/>. Since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of <a4_0>sapwood<a4_0/>, because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree."}
