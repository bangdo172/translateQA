Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the <a0_0>crown<a0_0/> of the tree. If the rings are <a1_0>narrow<a1_0/>, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become <a2_0>thinner<a2_0/> or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than <a3_0>near the base<a3_0/>, because the <a4_0>age<a4_0/> and the diameter of the upper sections are less."}
