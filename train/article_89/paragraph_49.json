The <a1_0>density<a1_0/> of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its <a2_0>strength<a2_0/> (mechanical properties). For example, mahogany is a medium-dense <a3_0>hardwood<a3_0/> that is excellent for fine furniture crafting, whereas balsa is light, making it useful for <a4_0>model building<a4_0/>. One of the densest woods is black ironwood."}
