It is an organic material, a natural composite of <a1_0>cellulose<a1_0/> fibers (which are strong in tension) embedded in a matrix of <a2_0>lignin<a2_0/> which resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.[citation needed] In a living tree it performs a <a3_0>support<a3_0/> function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and <a4_0>nutrients<a4_0/> between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber."}
