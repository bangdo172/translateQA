It became one of the most important metals to the ancients. Eventually, humans learned to smelt metals such as <b8_0>copper and tin<b8_0/> from ore, and, around <a1_0>2500 BC<a1_0/>, began alloying the two metals to form bronze, which is much harder than its ingredients. <b9_0>Tin<b9_0/> was rare, however, being found mostly in <a3_0>Great Britain<a3_0/>. In the Middle East, people began alloying copper with zinc to form <a2_0>brass<a2_0/>. Ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced, such as hardness, toughness and melting point, under various conditions of temperature and work hardening, developing much of the information contained in modern alloy phase diagrams. Arrowheads from the Chinese Qin dynasty (around 200 BC) were often constructed with a hard bronze-head, but a softer bronze-tang, combining the alloys to prevent both dulling and breaking during use."}
