The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a <b5_0>substitutional alloy<b5_0/>. Examples of <a0_0><a1_0>substitutional alloys<a1_0/><a0_0/> include <b6_0>bronze and brass<b6_0/>, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms. With the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the interstices. This is referred to as an interstitial alloy. <a2_0>Steel<a2_0/> is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. Stainless steel is an example of a combination of <a3_0><b7_0>interstitial and substitutional<a3_0/> allo<b7_0/>ys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms."}
