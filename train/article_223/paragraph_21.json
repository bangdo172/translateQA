Precipitation hardening alloys, such as certain alloys of aluminium, titanium, and copper, are heat-treatable alloys that soften when <b5_0><b6_0>quenched<b6_0/><b5_0/> (cooled quickly), and then <a2_0>harden over time<a2_0/>. After quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium, copper, and magnesium, Wilm discovered that the <b8_0>alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature<b8_0/>. Although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919, <a3_0><a4_0><b9_0>duralumin<b9_0/><a4_0/><a3_0/> was one of the first \"age hardening\" alloys to be used, and was soon followed by many others. Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight, these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry, including the construction of modern aircraft."}
