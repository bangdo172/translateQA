Most metals and alloys can be work hardened by creating <b6_0>defects in their <b5_0><b8_0>crystal structure<b8_0/><b6_0/><b5_0/>. These defects are created during plastic deformation, such as hammering or bending, and are permanent unless the metal is recrystallized. However, some alloys can also have their properties altered by <a0_0>heat treatment<a0_0/>. <b7_0>Nearly all metals<b7_0/> can be softened by <a1_0>annealing<a1_0/>, which <a3_0>recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects<a3_0/>, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling.
