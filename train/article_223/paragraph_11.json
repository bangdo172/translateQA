The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming <b7_0>intermetallic phases<b7_0/>, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates to form different crystal phases, precipitation hardening alloys separate to form different phases within the same crystal. These <b6_0>intermetallic alloys<b6_0/> appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneous, becoming hard and somewhat brittle."}
