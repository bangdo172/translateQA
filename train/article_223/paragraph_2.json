A metal that is normally very soft and malleable, such as <a1_0><b6_0>aluminium<b6_0/><a1_0/>, can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, like copper. Although both metals are very soft and ductile, the resulting aluminium alloy will be much harder and stronger. <a0_0>Adding a small amount of non-metallic carbon to iron<a0_0/> produces an alloy called <b5_0>steel<b5_0/>. Due to its very-high strength and toughness (which is much higher than pure iron), and its ability to be greatly altered by heat treatment, <a3_0>steel<a3_0/> is one of the most common <b9_0>alloys<b9_0/> in modern use. By adding <a2_0><b7_0>chromium<b7_0/><a2_0/> to steel, its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced, creating stainless steel, while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics, producing silicon steel."}
