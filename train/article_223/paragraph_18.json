Called the <b6_0>bloomery process<b6_0/>, it produced very soft but ductile wrought iron. By 800 BC, <b7_0>iron-making technology<b7_0/> had spread to Europe, arriving in <b8_0>Japan<b8_0/> <a2_0>around 700 AD<a2_0/>. <b9_0>Pig iron<b9_0/>, a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and <a3_0>carbon<a3_0/>, was being produced in China as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. Pig iron has a <a4_0>lower melting point<a4_0/> than iron, and was used for making cast-iron. However, these metals found little practical use until the introduction of crucible steel around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of pattern welding, around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal. Around 700 AD, the Japanese began folding bloomery-steel and cast-iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords, using clay fluxes to remove slag and impurities. This method of Japanese swordsmithing produced one of the purest steel-alloys of the early Middle Ages."}
