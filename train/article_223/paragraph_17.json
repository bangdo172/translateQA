However, in the Bronze age, <a2_0>tin<a2_0/> was a rare metal and, in many parts of <b7_0>Europe and the Mediterranean<b7_0/>, was often valued higher than gold. To make jewelry, forks and spoons, or other objects from tin, it was usually <a3_0>alloyed with other metals<a3_0/> to increase its strength and hardness. These metals were typically <a4_0>lead, antimony, bismuth or copper<a4_0/>.
