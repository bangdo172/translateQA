Meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of <b6_0>iron and nickel,<b6_0/> but are not native to the Earth. One of the first alloys made by humans was <a2_0><a3_0>bronze<a3_0/><a2_0/>, which is made by mixing the metals tin and <b7_0>copper<b7_0/>. Bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients, because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components. Steel was another common alloy. However, in ancient times, it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires (smelting) during the manufacture of iron. Other ancient alloys include pewter, brass and pig iron. In the modern age, steel can be created in many forms. Carbon steel can be made by varying only the carbon content, producing soft alloys like mild steel or hard alloys like spring steel. Alloy steels can be made by adding other elements, such as molybdenum, vanadium or nickel, resulting in alloys such as high-speed steel or tool steel. Small amounts of <b9_0>manganese<b9_0/> are usually alloyed with most modern-steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities, like phosphorus, sulfur and oxygen, which can have detrimental effects on the alloy. However, most <b8_0>alloys<b8_0/> were not created until the <a4_0>1900s<a4_0/>, such as various aluminium, titanium, nickel, and magnesium alloys. Some modern superalloys, such as incoloy, inconel, and hastelloy, may consist of a multitude of different components."}
