However, very small amounts of <b6_0>steel<b6_0/>, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of <b5_0>steel<b5_0/> by heat treatment had been known since <a0_0>1100 BC<a0_0/>, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister <b7_0>steel<b7_0/> during the <a1_0>Middle Ages<a1_0/>. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In <a3_0>1740<a3_0/>, <a2_0>Benjamin Huntsman<a2_0/> began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel. <b8_0>Huntsman's<b8_0/> process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s."}
