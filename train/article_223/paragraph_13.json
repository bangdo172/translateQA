As no <b6_0>metallurgic processes<b6_0/> were used to separate iron from nickel, the alloy was used as it was. Meteoric iron could be forged from a red heat to make objects such as <a2_0>tools, weapons, and nails<a2_0/>. In many cultures it was shaped by cold hammering into <b7_0>knives and arrowheads<b7_0/>.
