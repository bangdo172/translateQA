Gold was often found alloyed with silver or other metals to produce various types of colored gold. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes. Copper was often added to <b7_0>silver<b7_0/> to make sterling silver, increasing its strength for use in <b8_0>dishes, silverware,<b8_0/> and other practical items.
