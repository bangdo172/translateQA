Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the liquid pig iron to create <a1_0><b6_0>steel<b6_0/><a1_0/>. <b7_0>Puddling<b7_0/> was introduced during the <a2_0>1700s<a2_0/>, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. In <a3_0><b8_0>1858<b8_0/><a3_0/>, Sir Henry Bessemer developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The Bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow. <a4_0><b9_0>Mangalloy<b9_0/><a4_0/>, an alloy of steel and manganese exhibiting extreme hardness and toughness, was one of the first alloy steels, and was created by Robert Hadfield in 1882."}
