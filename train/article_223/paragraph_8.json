For example, steel is stronger than iron, its primary element. The electrical and thermal conductivity of <a1_0><b6_0>alloys<b6_0/><a1_0/> is usually lower than that of the pure metals. The physical properties, such as density, reactivity, Young's modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements, but engineering properties such as tensile strength and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on <b9_0>neighboring atoms<b9_0/>, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present. For example, impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura. Some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. <a2_0><b7_0>Bronze<a2_0/>,<b7_0/> an alloy of copper and tin, was the first alloy discovered, during the <a3_0>prehistoric period<a3_0/> now known as the bronze age; it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for ornaments, bells, statues, and bearings. <a4_0>Brass<a4_0/> is an alloy made from <b8_0>copper<b8_0/> and zinc."}
