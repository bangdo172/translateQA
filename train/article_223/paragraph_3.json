If the mixture cools and the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous microstructure of different phases. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. These alloys are called <a2_0><b6_0>intermetallic alloys<b6_0/><a2_0/> because, if cooled very quickly, they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase, but they are supersaturated with the secondary constituents. As time passes, the atoms of these supersaturated alloys separate within the crystals, forming <b7_0>intermetallic phases<b7_0/> that serve <a1_0>to reinforce the crystals internally<a1_0/>."}
