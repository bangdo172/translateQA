These impurities are often found in the base metals or the solutes, but they may also be introduced during the alloying process. For instance, <b5_0>sulfur<b5_0/> is a common impurity in steel. Sulfur combines readily with iron to form iron sulfide, which is <a0_0>very brittle<a0_0/>, creating weak spots in the steel. <a2_0>Lithium, sodium and <b6_0>calcium<b6_0/><a2_0/> are common impurities in aluminium alloys, which can have adverse effects on the structural integrity of castings. Conversely, otherwise pure-metals that simply contain <a1_0>unwanted impurities<a1_0/> are often called \"impure metals\" and are not usually referred to as alloys. <b8_0>Oxygen<b8_0/>, present in the air, readily combines with most metals to form metal oxides; especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying. Great care is often taken during the alloying process to <a3_0>remove excess impurities<a3_0/>, using fluxes, chemical <b7_0>additives<b7_0/>, or other methods of extractive metallurgy."}
