Proper nouns, honorifics, and the first letters of quotations are <a1_0>capitalized<a1_0/>, and <a2_0>punctuation<a2_0/> is typical of other Latin European languages. Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to most European languages. The Czech language uses <b5_0>a decimal comma<b5_0/> instead of <b9_0>a decimal point<b9_0/>. When writing a long number, <b6_0><b8_0>spaces between every three numbers<b8_0/><b6_0/> (e.g. between hundreds and thousands) may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts, but not in decimal places, like in English. The number 1,234,567.8910 may be written as 1234567,8910 or 1 234 567,8910. Ordinal numbers (1st) use a point as in <a3_0>German<a3_0/> (1.). In proper noun phrases (except personal names), <a4_0><b7_0>only the first<a4_0/> word<b7_0/> is capitalized (Pra\u017esk\u00fd hrad, Prague Castle)."}
