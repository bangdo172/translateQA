The h\u00e1\u010dek (\u02c7) is used with certain letters to form new characters: \u0161, \u017e, and \u010d, as well as <b7_0>\u0148, \u011b, \u0159, \u0165, and \u010f<b7_0/> (the latter five uncommon outside Czech). The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above (\u02bc, an abbreviated h\u00e1\u010dek) because of their height.
