They are /a/, /\u025b/, /\u026a/, /o/, and /u/, their long counterparts /a\u02d0/, /\u025b\u02d0/, /i\u02d0/, /o\u02d0/ and /u\u02d0/, and three diphthongs, /ou\u032f/, /au\u032f/ and /\u025bu\u032f/. <b7_0>The latter two diphthongs and the long /o\u02d0/<b7_0/> are exclusive to loanwords.

Each word usually has primary stress <b9_0>on its <a3_0>first syllable<b9_0/><a3_0/>, except for enclitics (minor, monosyllabic, unstressed syllables). In all words of more than two syllables, every odd-numbered syllable receives secondary stress. Stress is unrelated to <a4_0>vowel length<a4_0/>, and the possibility of stressed short vowels and unstressed long vowels can be confusing to students whose native language combines the features (such as English)."}
