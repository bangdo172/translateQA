In practice, however, word order is <b6_0>flexible<b6_0/> and used for <a1_0><b7_0>topicalization and focus<b7_0/><a1_0/>. Although Czech has a <a2_0>periphrastic<a2_0/> passive construction (like English), colloquial word-order changes frequently produce <b8_0>the passive voice<b8_0/>. For example, to change \"Peter killed Paul\" to \"Paul was killed by Peter\" the order of subject and object is <a3_0>inverted<a3_0/>: Petr zabil Pavla (\"Peter killed Paul\") becomes \"Paul, Peter killed\" (Pavla zabil Petr). Pavla is in the <a4_0><b9_0>accusative<b9_0/><a4_0/> case, the grammatical object (in this case, the victim) of the verb."}
