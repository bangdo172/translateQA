During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the <a0_0>transmission of knowledge<a0_0/>, while societies functioned <a1_0>to create knowledge<a1_0/>. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by <a2_0>1789<a2_0/> there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, <a3_0>Bernard de Fontenelle<a3_0/> coined the term \"the Age of Academies\" to describe the 18th century."}
