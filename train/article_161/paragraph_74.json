It was a forum that supported \"<a0_0>free public examination of questions regarding religion or legislation<a0_0/>\". Immanuel Kant considered <a3_0>written communication<a3_0/> essential to his conception of the public sphere; once everyone was a part of <a1_0>the \"reading public\"<a1_0/>, then society could be said to be enlightened. The people who participated in the Republic of Letters, such as <a2_0>Diderot and Voltaire<a2_0/>, are frequently known today as important Enlightenment figures. Indeed, the men who wrote Diderot's Encyclop\u00e9die arguably formed a microcosm of the larger \"republic\"."}
