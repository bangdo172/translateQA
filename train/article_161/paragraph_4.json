The most famous natural right formulation comes from John Locke in his <a4_0>Second Treatise<a4_0/>, when he introduces the state of nature. For Locke the law of nature is grounded on mutual security, or <a0_0>the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights<a0_0/>, as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights. These natural rights include <a1_0>perfect equality and freedom, and the right to preserve life and property<a1_0/>. Locke also argued against slavery on the basis that enslaving yourself goes against the law of nature; you cannot surrender your own rights, your freedom is absolute and no one can take it from you. Additionally, Locke argues that one person cannot enslave another <a2_0>because it is morally reprehensible<a2_0/>, although he introduces a caveat by saying that <a3_0>enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one's natural rights<a3_0/>."}
