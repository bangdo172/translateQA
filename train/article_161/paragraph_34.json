Freemasonry as a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals originated in <a0_0>Scotland<a0_0/> around 1600 and spread first to <a1_0>England<a1_0/> and then across the Continent in the eighteenth century. They fostered new codes of conduct \u2013 including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability \u2013 \"liberty, fraternity, and equality\" Scottish soldiers and Jacobite Scots brought to the Continent ideals of fraternity which reflected not the local system of Scottish customs but the institutions and ideals originating in the English Revolution against royal absolutism. <a3_0>Freemasonry<a3_0/> was particularly prevalent in <a2_0>France<a2_0/> \u2013 by 1789, there were perhaps as many as 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all Enlightenment associations. The Freemasons displayed a passion for secrecy and created new degrees and ceremonies. Similar societies, partially imitating Freemasonry, emerged in France, Germany, Sweden and Russia. One example was the \"<a4_0>Illuminati<a4_0/>\" founded in Bavaria in 1776, which was copied after the Freemasons but was never part of the movement. The Illuminati was an overtly political group, which most Masonic lodges decidedly were not."}
