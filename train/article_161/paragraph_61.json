One view of the political changes that occurred during the Enlightenment is that the <a2_0>\"consent of the governed\"<a2_0/> philosophy as delineated by <a1_0>Locke<a1_0/> in Two Treatises of Government (1689) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the \"divine right of kings\". In this view, the revolutions of the late 1700s and early 1800s were caused by the fact that this <a3_0>governance paradigm shift<a3_0/> often could not be resolved peacefully, and therefore violent revolution was the result. Clearly a governance philosophy where the king was never wrong was in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government."}
