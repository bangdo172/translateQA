The study of science, under the heading of natural philosophy, was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and <a0_0>natural history<a0_0/>, which included anatomy, biology, geology, mineralogy, and zoology. As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally; <a1_0>Rousseau<a1_0/> criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by <a2_0>scientific societies and academies<a2_0/>, which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population. Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the Encyclop\u00e9die and the popularization of <a4_0>Newtonianism<a4_0/> by Voltaire and \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet. Some historians have marked <a3_0>the 18th century<a3_0/> as a drab period in the history of science; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry."}
