One manifestation of this involved women, who became more involved with music on a social level. Women were already engaged in professional roles as singers, and increased their presence in the amateur performers' scene, especially with <a2_0>keyboard<a2_0/> music. Music publishers begin to print music that amateurs could understand and play. The majority of the works that were published were for <a3_0>keyboard, voice and keyboard, and chamber ensemble<a3_0/>. After these initial genres were popularized, from the mid-century on, amateur groups sang choral music, which then became a new trend for publishers to capitalize on. The increasing study of the fine arts, as well as access to amateur-friendly published works, led to more people becoming interested in reading and discussing music. Music magazines, reviews, and critical works which suited amateurs as well as connoisseurs began to surface."}
