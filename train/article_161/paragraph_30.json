The first journal, <a1_0>the Parisian Journal des S\u00e7avans<a1_0/>, appeared in <a2_0>1665<a2_0/>. However, it was not until 1682 that periodicals began to be more widely produced. <a3_0>French and Latin<a3_0/> were the dominant languages of publication, but there was also a steady demand for material in German and Dutch. There was generally low demand for English publications on the Continent, which was echoed by England's similar lack of desire for French works. Languages commanding less of an international market \u2013 such as Danish, Spanish and Portuguese \u2013 found journal success more difficult, and more often than not, a more international language was used instead. French slowly took over Latin's status as the lingua franca of learned circles. This in turn gave precedence to the publishing industry in <a4_0>Holland<a4_0/>, where the vast majority of these French language periodicals were produced."}
