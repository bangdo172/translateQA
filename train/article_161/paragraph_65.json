These men of letters constituted a sort of \"substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power\". This illusory power came from <a2_0>the rise of \"public opinion\"<a2_0/>, born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The \"literary politics\" that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime. De Tocqueville \"clearly designates ... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power\". Nevertheless, it took another century before cultural approach became central to the historiography, as typified by Robert Darnton, The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the Encyclop\u00e9die, 1775\u20131800 (1979)."}
