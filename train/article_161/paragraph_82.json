An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was due to <a0_0>a high rise in the availability of food<a0_0/>. This enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for <a1_0>education<a1_0/>. <a2_0>Popularization<a2_0/> was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured \"to make information available to the greatest number of people.\" As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies. More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. <a3_0>Sir Isaac Newton<a3_0/>'s celebrated <a4_0>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica<a4_0/> was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular."}
