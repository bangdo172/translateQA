On one end of the spectrum was the Biblioth\u00e8que Bleue, a collection of cheaply produced books published in <a0_0>Troyes, France<a0_0/>. Intended for a <a1_0>largely rural and semi-literate<a1_0/> audience these books included almanacs, retellings of medieval romances and condensed versions of popular novels, among other things. While some historians have argued against the Enlightenment's penetration into the lower classes, the <a3_0>Biblioth\u00e8que Bleue<a3_0/> represents at least a desire to participate in Enlightenment sociability. Moving up the classes, a variety of institutions offered readers access to material without needing to buy anything. Libraries that lent out their material for a small price started to appear, and occasionally bookstores would offer a small lending library to their patrons. Coffee houses commonly offered books, journals and sometimes even popular novels to their customers. <a2_0>The Tatler and The Spectator<a2_0/>, two influential periodicals sold from 1709 to 1714, were closely associated with coffee house culture in London, being both read and produced in various establishments in the city. This is an example of the triple or even quadruple function of the coffee house: reading material was often obtained, read, discussed and even produced on the premises."}
