Jean-Jacques Rousseau's <a1_0>Dictionnaire de musique<a1_0/> (published 1767 in Geneva and 1768 in Paris) was a leading text in the late 18th century. This widely available dictionary gave short definitions of words like genius and taste, and was clearly influenced by the Enlightenment movement. Another text influenced by Enlightenment values was Charles Burney's A General History of Music: From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period (<a2_0>1776<a2_0/>), which was a historical survey and an attempt to rationalize elements in music systematically over time. Recently, musicologists have shown renewed interest in the ideas and consequences of the Enlightenment. For example, Rose Rosengard Subotnik's Deconstructive Variations (subtitled Music and Reason in Western Society) compares Mozart's <a3_0>Die Zauberfl\u00f6te (1791)<a3_0/> using the <a4_0>Enlightenment and Romantic<a4_0/> perspectives, and concludes that the work is \"an ideal musical representation of the Enlightenment\"."}
