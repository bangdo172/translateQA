It was closely tied to the French state, acting as an extension of a government seriously lacking in scientists. It helped promote and organize new disciplines, and it trained new scientists. It also contributed to the enhancement of <a1_0>scientists<a1_0/>' social status, considering them to be the \"most useful of all citizens\". Academies demonstrate the rising interest in science along with its increasing secularization, as evidenced by the small number of clerics who were members (<a2_0>13 percent<a2_0/>). The presence of the French academies in the public sphere cannot be attributed to their membership; although the majority of their members were bourgeois, the exclusive institution was only open to <a3_0>elite Parisian scholars<a3_0/>. They perceived themselves as \"<a4_0>interpreters of the sciences for the people<a4_0/>\". For example, it was with this in mind that academicians took it upon themselves to disprove the popular pseudo-science of mesmerism."}
