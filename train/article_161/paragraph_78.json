It was founded by a group of independent scientists and given a royal charter in <a1_0>1662<a1_0/>. The Society played a large role in spreading <a2_0>Robert Boyle<a2_0/>'s experimental philosophy around Europe, and acted as a clearinghouse for intellectual correspondence and exchange. Boyle was \"a founder of the experimental world in which scientists now live and operate,\" and his method based knowledge on experimentation, which had to be witnessed to provide proper empirical legitimacy. This is where the Royal Society came into play: witnessing had to be a \"collective act\", and the Royal Society's assembly rooms were ideal locations for relatively public demonstrations. However, not just any witness was considered to be credible; \"<a3_0>Oxford professors<a3_0/> were accounted more reliable witnesses than Oxfordshire peasants.\" Two factors were taken into account: <a4_0>a witness's knowledge in the area; and a witness's \"moral constitution\"<a4_0/>. In other words, only civil society were considered for Boyle's public."}
