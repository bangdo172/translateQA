From Immanuel Kant's 1784 essay \"Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufkl\u00e4rung?\" (\"Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?\") the German term became '<a1_0>Aufkl\u00e4rung<a1_0/>' (aufkl\u00e4ren = to illuminate; sich aufkl\u00e4ren = to clear up). However, scholars have never agreed on a definition of the Enlightenment, or on its chronological or geographical extent. Terms like \"les Lumi\u00e8res\" (French), \"<a3_0>illuminismo<a3_0/>\" (Italian), \"ilustraci\u00f3n\" (Spanish) and \"Aufkl\u00e4rung\" (German) referred to partly <a4_0>overlapping<a4_0/> movements. Not until the late nineteenth century did English scholars agree they were talking about \"the Enlightenment.\""}
