They \"reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, elections and representatives.\" In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the Continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the <a0_0>1730s<a0_0/>, their embodiment of <a1_0>British<a1_0/> values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, <a2_0>the Parisian lodge<a2_0/> that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English Jacobite exiles. Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole. In French lodges, for example, the line \"As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened\" was a part of their initiation rites. <a3_0>British<a3_0/> lodges assigned themselves the duty to \"initiate the unenlightened\". This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy. In fact, many lodges praised the <a4_0>Grand Architect<a4_0/>, the masonic terminology for the deistic divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe."}
