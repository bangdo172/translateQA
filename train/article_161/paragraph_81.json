Encyclopedias and dictionaries also became more popular during the Age of Reason as <a2_0>the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multiply<a2_0/>.

Along with growth in numbers, dictionaries and encyclopedias also grew in length, often having multiple print runs that sometimes included in supplemented editions."}
