Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the <a0_0>upper<a0_0/> classes. Works of natural history include <a2_0>Ren\u00e9-Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur<a2_0/>'s Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie compl\u00e8te, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746). Outside ancien r\u00e9gime France, <a1_0>natural history<a1_0/> was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by M D Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas."}
