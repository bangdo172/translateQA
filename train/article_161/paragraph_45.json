The political philosopher <a3_0>Montesquieu<a3_0/> introduced the idea of a separation of powers in a government, a concept which was enthusiastically adopted by the authors of <a4_0>the United States Constitution<a4_0/>. While the Philosophes of the French Enlightenment were not revolutionaries, and many were members of the nobility, their ideas played an important part in undermining the legitimacy of the Old Regime and shaping the French Revolution."}
