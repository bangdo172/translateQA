Both areas of knowledge were united by <a2_0>philosophy<a2_0/>, or the trunk of the tree of knowledge. The Enlightenment's desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree's design, particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch, with black magic as a close neighbour. As the Encyclop\u00e9die gained popularity, it was published in quarto and octavo editions after 1777. The <a3_0>quarto and octavo<a3_0/> editions were much less expensive than previous editions, making the Encyclop\u00e9die more accessible to the non-elite. Robert Darnton estimates that there were approximately <a4_0>25 000<a4_0/> copies of the Encyclop\u00e9die in circulation throughout France and Europe before the French Revolution. The extensive, yet affordable encyclopedia came to represent the transmission of Enlightenment and scientific education to an expanding audience."}
