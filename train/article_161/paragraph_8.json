French historians usually place the period, called the <a2_0>Si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res (Century of Enlightenments)<a2_0/>, between 1715 and 1789, from the beginning of the reign of <a1_0>Louis XV<a1_0/> until the French Revolution. If taken back to the mid-17th century, the Enlightenment would trace its origins to Descartes' Discourse on Method, published in <a3_0>1637<a3_0/>. In France, many cited the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica in <a4_0>1687<a4_0/>. It is argued by several historians and philosophers that the beginning of the Enlightenment is when Descartes shifted the epistemological basis from external authority to internal certainty by his cogito ergo sum published in 1637. As to its end, most scholars use the last years of the century, often choosing the <a0_0>French Revolution<a0_0/> of 1789 or the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars (1804\u201315) as a convenient point in time with which to date the end of the Enlightenment."}
