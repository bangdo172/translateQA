Harris' book avoided theological and biographical entries; instead it concentrated on <a2_0>science and technology<a2_0/>. Published in <a3_0>1704<a3_0/>, the Lexicon technicum was the first book to be written in <a4_0>English<a4_0/> that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial arithmetic along with the physical sciences and navigation. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris' model, including Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia (1728), which included five editions, and was a substantially larger work than Harris'. The folio edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The Cyclopaedia emphasized Newtonian theories, Lockean philosophy, and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as engraving, brewing, and dyeing."}
