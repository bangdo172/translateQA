In the 16th century some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that <a2_0>they were of Roman extraction<a2_0/>, and the Lithuanian language was just a morphed Latin language. This led to paradox: Polish nobility claimed own ancestry from Sarmatian tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies to Romans. Thus new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led that in the 16th century the new term to name Lithuanian nobility appeared \u0161l\u0117kta\u2014a direct loanword from Polish szlachta. From the view of historical truth Lithuanians also should use this term, <a3_0>\u0161l\u0117kta<a3_0/> (szlachta), to name own nobility, but <a4_0>Lithuanian linguists<a4_0/> forbade the usage of this Polish loanword. This refusal to use word szlachta (in Lithuanian text \u0161l\u0117kta) complicates all naming."}
