He broadened the definition of who was a member of the nobility and <a2_0>exempted the entire class from all but one tax<a2_0/> (\u0142anowy, which was limited to 2 grosze from \u0142an (an old measure of land size)). In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was <a3_0>abolished<a3_0/>; no new taxes could be raised without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, also, district offices (Polish: \"urz\u0119dy ziemskie\") were reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, this privilege obliged the <a4_0>King to pay indemnities<a4_0/> to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders."}
