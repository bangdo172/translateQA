In its broadest meaning, it can also denote some non-hereditary honorary knighthoods granted today by some European monarchs. Occasionally, 19th-century non-noble landowners were referred to as <a1_0>szlachta<a1_0/> <a2_0>by courtesy or error<a2_0/>, when they owned manorial estates though they were not noble by birth. In the narrow sense, szlachta denotes the <a3_0>old-Commonwealth nobility<a3_0/>."}
