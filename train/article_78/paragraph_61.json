This belief system became an important part of szlachta culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, <a3_0>peace and pacifism<a3_0/>. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel (the \u017cupan, kontusz, sukmana, pas kontuszowy, delia); and made the scimitar-like szabla, too, a near-obligatory item of everyday szlachta apparel. Sarmatism <a2_0>served to integrate the multi-ethnic nobility<a2_0/> as it created an almost nationalistic sense of unity and pride in the szlachta's \"Golden Liberty\" (z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107). Knowledge of Latin was widespread, and most szlachta freely mixed <a4_0>Polish and Latin<a4_0/> vocabulary (the latter, \"macaronisms\"\u2014from \"macaroni\") in everyday conversation."}
