Daytime highs in the Piedmont often reach over <a1_0>90 \u00b0F<a1_0/> (32 \u00b0C) in the summer. While it is not common for the temperature to reach over 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) in the state, such temperatures, when they occur, typically are found only in the lower-elevation areas of the Piedmont and far-inland areas of the coastal plain.
