The western Piedmont is often protected by the <a3_0>mountains<a3_0/>, which tend to break up storms as they try to cross over; the storms will often re-form farther east. Also a weather phenomenon known as \"<a4_0>cold air damming<a4_0/>\" often occurs in the northwestern part of the state, which can also weaken storms but can also lead to major ice events in winter."}
