Among the subranges of the <a1_0>Appalachians<a1_0/> located in the state are the Great Smoky Mountains, Blue Ridge Mountains, Great Balsam Mountains, and Black Mountains. <a2_0>The Black Mountains<a2_0/> are the highest in the eastern United States, and culminate in <a3_0>Mount Mitchell<a3_0/> at <a4_0>6,684 feet<a4_0/> (2,037 m) the highest point east of the Mississippi River. Although agriculture still remains important, tourism has become a dominant industry in the mountains. Growing Christmas trees has recently become an important industry as well. Because of the higher altitude, the climate in the mountains often differs markedly from that of the rest of the state. Winter in western North Carolina typically features high snowfall and subfreezing temperatures more akin to those of a midwestern state than of a southern state."}
