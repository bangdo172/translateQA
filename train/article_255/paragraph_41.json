Since Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter's comfortable victory in the state in <a0_0>1976<a0_0/>, the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat Barack Obama narrowly won the state in <a1_0>2008<a1_0/>. In the 1990s, Democrat Bill Clinton came within a point of winning the state in <a2_0>1992<a2_0/> and also only narrowly lost the state in <a3_0>1996<a3_0/>. In the early 2000s, Republican George W. Bush easily won the state by over 12 points, but by 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in heavily populated areas such as the Research Triangle, Charlotte, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Fayetteville, and Asheville, propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In 2012, North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their 2012 Democratic National Convention in <a4_0>Charlotte<a4_0/>. However, Republican Mitt Romney ultimately eked out a 2-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with Indiana) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012."}
