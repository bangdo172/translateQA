Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse in present-day <a2_0>Greensboro<a2_0/> on March 15, 1781. Although the British troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling.

This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at Yorktown, Virginia, later in 1781. The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence."}
