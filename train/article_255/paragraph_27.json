The dates of both of these events are memorialized on the state flag and state seal. Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce guerrilla warfare erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries. A major American victory in the war took place at King's Mountain along the North Carolina\u2013South Carolina border; on October 7, <a2_0>1780<a2_0/>, a force of <a3_0>1000<a3_0/> mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of Tennessee)and Southwest Virginia overwhelmed a force of some <a4_0>1000<a4_0/> British troops led by Major Patrick Ferguson. Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called \"Tories\" or Loyalists). The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories."}
