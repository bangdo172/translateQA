Methodists do not have any additional teachings on the Virgin Mary except from what is mentioned in <a2_0>Scripture and the ecumenical Creeds<a2_0/>.

Contemporary Methodism does hold that Mary was a virgin before, during, and immediately after the birth of Christ. In addition, some Methodists also hold the doctrine of the Assumption of Mary as a pious opinion."}
