However, the Orthodox views on Mary are mostly doxological, rather than academic: they are expressed in hymns, praise, liturgical poetry and the veneration of icons. One of the most loved Orthodox Akathists (i.e. <a0_0><b8_0>standing hymns<b8_0/><a0_0/>) is devoted to <b4_0>Mary<b4_0/> and it is often simply called <a2_0>the Akathist Hymn<a2_0/>. <a1_0><b5_0><b7_0>Five<b7_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/> of the twelve Great Feasts in Orthodoxy are dedicated to Mary. <b6_0>The <a3_0>Sunday of Orthodoxy<b6_0/><a3_0/> directly links the Virgin Mary's identity as Mother of God with icon veneration. A number of Orthodox feasts are connected with the miraculous icons of the Theotokos."}
