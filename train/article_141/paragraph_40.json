While some Christians such as <b2_0>Roman Catholics<b2_0/> and Eastern Orthodox have well established Marian traditions, Protestants at large pay scant attention to Mariological themes. Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutherans venerate the Virgin Mary. This veneration especially takes the form of prayer for intercession with <b1_0>her Son, Jesus Christ<b1_0/>. Additionally it includes composing poems and songs in Mary's honor, painting icons or carving statues of her, and conferring titles on <b0_0><b3_0>Mary<b3_0/><b0_0/> that reflect her position among the saints."}
