According to <b7_0>author <b6_0>Shabbir Akhtar<b7_0/><b6_0/>, the Islamic perspective on Mary's Immaculate Conception is compatible with the Catholic doctrine of the same topic. \"O <a3_0>People of the Book<a3_0/>! Do not go beyond the bounds in your religion, and do not say anything of Allah but the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was but <a1_0>a Messenger of God<a1_0/>, and a Word of His (Power) which He conveyed to Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in <a2_0>Allah<a2_0/> (as the One, Unique God), and His Messengers (including Jesus, as Messenger); and do not say: (Allah is one of) a trinity. Give up (this assertion) \u00e2\u20ac\" (it is) for your own good (to do so). Allah is but One Allah ; All-Glorified He is in that He is absolutely above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah suffices as the One to be relied on, to Whom affairs should be referred.\" Quran 4/171"}
