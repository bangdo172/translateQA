Other scholars contend that the Greek word heos (i.e., <a1_0>until<a1_0/>) denotes a state up to a point, but does not mean that the state ended after that point, and that Matthew 1:25 does not confirm or deny the virginity of Mary after the birth of Jesus. According to Biblical scholar <b8_0>Bart Ehrman<b8_0/> the <b9_0>Hebrew<b9_0/> word almah, meaning young woman of childbearing age, was translated into Greek as parthenos, which only means <a4_0>virgin<a4_0/>, in Isaiah 7:14, which is commonly believed by Christians to be the prophecy of the <a0_0>Virgin Mary<a0_0/> referred to in Matthew <a2_0>1:23<a2_0/>. While Matthew and <a3_0>Luke<a3_0/> give differing versions of the virgin birth, John quotes the uninitiated Philip and the disbelieving Jews gathered at <b6_0><b7_0>Galilee<b7_0/><b6_0/> referring to Joseph as Jesus's father."}
