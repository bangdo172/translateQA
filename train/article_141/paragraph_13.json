A more practical explanation for the use of this colour is that in Medieval and Renaissance Europe, the blue pigment was derived from the rock <a1_0><b7_0>lapis lazuli<b7_0/><a1_0/>, a stone imported from <a2_0><b8_0>Afghanistan<b8_0/><a2_0/> of greater value than <a3_0><b9_0>gold<b9_0/><a3_0/>. Beyond a painter's retainer, patrons were expected to purchase any gold or lapis lazuli to be used in the painting. Hence, it was an expression of devotion and glorification to swathe the Virgin in gowns of blue."}
