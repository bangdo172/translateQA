Roman Catholics view Mary as subordinate to Christ, but uniquely so, in that she is seen as above all other creatures. Similarly Theologian <a3_0>Sergei Bulgakov<a3_0/> wrote that the Orthodox view Mary as \"superior to all created beings\" and \"ceaselessly pray for her intercession\". However, she is not considered a \"substitute for the One Mediator\" who is Christ. \"Let Mary be in honor, but let worship be given to the Lord\", he wrote. Similarly, Catholics do not worship Mary as a divine being, but rather \"hyper-venerate\" her. In Roman Catholic theology, the term <a0_0><b8_0>hyperdulia<b8_0/><a0_0/> is reserved for Marian veneration, <a4_0><b7_0>latria<b7_0/><a4_0/> for the worship of God, and dulia for the veneration of <a2_0>other saints and angels<a2_0/>. The definition of the three level hierarchy of latria, hyperdulia and dulia goes back to the Second Council of Nicaea in <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0><b9_0>787<b9_0/><b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/>."}
