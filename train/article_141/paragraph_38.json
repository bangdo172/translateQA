This took place when she was already betrothed to Joseph and was awaiting the concluding rite of marriage, the formal home-taking ceremony. She married Joseph and accompanied him to <b1_0><b3_0>Bethlehem<b3_0/><b1_0/>, where Jesus was born. According to ancient Jewish custom, Mary could have been betrothed at about <b0_0><b2_0>12<b2_0/><b0_0/>, however, there is no direct evidence of Mary's age at betrothal or in pregnancy. The term \"betrothal\" is an awkward translation of kiddushin; according to the Jewish law those called \"betrothed\" were actually husband and wife."}
