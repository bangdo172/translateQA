Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company <a2_0>Tungsram<a2_0/> in 1904. This type is often called <a4_0><b9_0>Tungsram-bulbs<b9_0/><a4_0/> in many European countries. Filling a bulb with an inert gas such as <a3_0><b8_0>argon or nitrogen<b8_0/><a3_0/> retards the evaporation of the tungsten filament compared to operating it in a vacuum. This allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater efficacy with less reduction in filament life."}
