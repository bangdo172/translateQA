The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then wire drawing. It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use, and that a very small \"doping\" treatment with <a4_0>potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides<a4_0/> at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments."}
