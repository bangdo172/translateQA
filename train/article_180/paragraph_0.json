The hot filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by <a2_0><b7_0>feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass<b7_0/><a2_0/>.
