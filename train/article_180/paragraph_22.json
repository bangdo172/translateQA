This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the \"flashing\" process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment <a2_0><b8_0>improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency<b8_0/><a2_0/>. A <b9_0>metallized or \"graphitized\" filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly<b9_0/>. This transformed the carbon into graphite which <a3_0>further strengthened and smoothed the filament<a3_0/>. This also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic conductor, and <a4_0>helped stabilize the lamp's power consumption, temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage<a4_0/>."}
