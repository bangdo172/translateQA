For a 60-watt 120-volt lamp, the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually <a0_0><b5_0>22.8 inches<b5_0/><a0_0/> (580 mm), and the filament diameter is <a3_0>0.0018 inches<a3_0/> (0.046 mm). The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil. <a1_0><b6_0>The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly<b6_0/><a1_0/> than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a <a2_0><b7_0>more efficient light source<b7_0/><a2_0/>, while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature."}
