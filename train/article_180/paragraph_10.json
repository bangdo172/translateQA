Donald L. Klipstein explains it this way: \"An ideal thermal radiator produces visible light most efficiently at temperatures around <a0_0><b6_0>6,300 \u00b0C<b6_0/><a0_0/> (6,600 K; 11,400 \u00b0F).

An upper limit for incandescent lamp luminous efficacy (LER) is around <a1_0><a4_0>52 lumens per watt<a4_0/><a1_0/>, the theoretical value emitted by tungsten at its melting point."}
