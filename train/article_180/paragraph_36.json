Some reflector-type lamps include <b6_0>screw terminals<b6_0/> for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced <b7_0>a multitude of incompatible lamp bases<b7_0/>. <a0_0><b8_0>General Electric<b8_0/><a0_0/> introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in <a1_0><b9_0>1909<b9_0/><a1_0/>. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include <a2_0>ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1<a2_0/> for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. <a3_0>Bayonet base lamps<a3_0/> are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration. A <a4_0>bipin base<a4_0/> is often used for halogen or reflector lamps."}
