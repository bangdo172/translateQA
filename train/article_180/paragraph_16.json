The <b7_0><b8_0>\"Halogena Energy Saver\" incandescents<b8_0/><b7_0/> can produce about 23 lm/W; about <a1_0>30 percent<a1_0/> more efficient than traditional incandescents, by using a <b9_0>reflective capsule<b9_0/> to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which it can be re-emitted as visible light. This concept was pioneered by <a2_0>Duro-Test<a2_0/> in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29.8 lm/W. More advanced reflectors based on interference filters or photonic crystals can theoretically result in higher efficiency, up to a limit of about <a3_0>270 lm/W<a3_0/> (40% of the maximum efficacy possible). Laboratory proof-of-concept experiments have produced as much as <a4_0>45 lm/W<a4_0/>, approaching the efficacy of compact fluorescent bulbs."}
