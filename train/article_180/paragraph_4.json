This received a British Patent in 1880.[dubious \u2013 discuss] On 18 December 1878, <b7_0><b8_0>a lamp using a slender carbon rod<b8_0/><b7_0/> was shown <a0_0>at a meeting of the Newcastle Chemical Society<a0_0/>, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. Besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical, they had a very short lifetime. Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce <a2_0><b9_0>'parchmentised thread'<b9_0/><a2_0/> and obtained British Patent 4933 in <a3_0>1880<a3_0/>. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, <a4_0>the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London<a4_0/> was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity."}
