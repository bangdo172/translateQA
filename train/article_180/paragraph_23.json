The metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use; the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use. This made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile. Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding, though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament. <a3_0><b8_0>General Electric<b8_0/><a3_0/> bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the US until <a4_0>1913<a4_0/>."}
