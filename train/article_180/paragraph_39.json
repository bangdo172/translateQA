Compared to general-service bulbs, for the same power, these bulbs produce far more light, and (more importantly) light at a <a3_0>higher color temperature<a3_0/>, at the expense of greatly reduced life (which may be <a2_0><b7_0>as short as two hours<b7_0/><a2_0/> for a type P1 lamp). The upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal. <a1_0><b6_0>Tungsten<b6_0/><a1_0/> is the metal with the highest melting point, 3,695 K (6,191 \u00b0F). A <b5_0>50-hour-life projection bulb<b5_0/>, for instance, is designed to operate only <a0_0><b4_0>50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F)<b4_0/><a0_0/> below that melting point. Such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt, compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp."}
