The coated glass bulbs have <b6_0>a white powdery substance on the inside called <a0_0>kaolin<b6_0/><a0_0/>. <b7_0>Kaolin, or kaolinite<b7_0/>, is a white, chalky clay in a very fine powder form, that is <a1_0>blown in and electrostatically deposited<a1_0/> on the interior of the bulb. <a4_0>It diffuses the light emitted from the filament<a4_0/>, producing <a2_0>a more gentle and evenly distributed light<a2_0/>. Manufacturers may add pigments to the kaolin to adjust the characteristics of the final light emitted from the bulb. <b8_0>Kaolin<b8_0/> diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. Other kinds of colored bulbs are also made, including the various colors used for \"party bulbs\", Christmas tree lights and other decorative lighting. These are created <a3_0>by coloring the glass with a dopant<a3_0/>; which is often a metal like cobalt (blue) or chromium (green). <b9_0>Neodymium-containing glass<b9_0/> is sometimes used to provide a more natural-appearing light."}
