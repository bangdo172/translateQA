White-balancing is still required <a0_0><b6_0>to avoid too \"warm\" or \"cool\" colors<b6_0/><a0_0/>, but this is a simple process that requires only the color temperature in Kelvin as input for modern, digital visual reproduction equipment such as video or still cameras unless it is completely automated. <b7_0>The color-rendering performance of <a1_0><b9_0>incandescent lights<b9_0/><b7_0/><a1_0/> cannot be matched by LEDs or fluorescent lights, although they can offer satisfactory performance for non-critical applications such as home lighting. White-balancing such lights is therefore more complicated, requiring additional adjustments to reduce for example green-magenta color casts, and even when properly white-balanced, the color reproduction will not be perfect."}
