Small variations in resistivity along the filament cause <b5_0>\"hot spots\" to form at points of higher resistivity<b5_0/>; <a0_0>a variation of diameter of only 1% will cause a 25% reduction in service life<a0_0/>. These <b6_0>hot spots<b6_0/> evaporate faster than the rest of the filament, which increases the resistance at that point\u2014this creates a positive feedback that ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament. <a1_0>Irving Langmuir<a1_0/> found that an <b7_0>inert gas<b7_0/>, instead of vacuum, would retard evaporation. General service incandescent light bulbs over about 25 watts in rating are now filled with a mixture of mostly <a2_0><b8_0>argon and some nitrogen, or sometimes krypton<b8_0/><a2_0/>. Lamps operated on direct current develop random stairstep irregularities on the filament surface which may cut lifespan in half compared to AC operation; different <a3_0>alloys of tungsten and rhenium<a3_0/> can be used to counteract the effect."}
