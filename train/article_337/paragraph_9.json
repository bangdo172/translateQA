On this occasion, Kerry was in tactical command of <a2_0>his Swift boat and two other Swift boats<a2_0/> during a combat operation. Their mission on <a1_0>the Duong Keo River<a1_0/> included bringing an underwater demolition team and dozens of South Vietnamese Marines to destroy enemy sampans, structures and bunkers as described in the story <a4_0>The Death Of PCF 43<a4_0/>. Running into heavy small arms fire from the river banks, Kerry \"directed the units to turn to the beach and charge the Viet Cong positions\" and he \"expertly directed\" his boat's fire causing the enemy to flee while at the same time coordinating the insertion of the ninety South Vietnamese troops (according to the original medal citation signed by <a3_0>Admiral Zumwalt<a3_0/>). Moving a short distance upstream, Kerry's boat was the target of a B-40 rocket round; Kerry charged the enemy positions and as his boat hove to and beached, a Viet Cong (\"VC\") insurgent armed with a rocket launcher emerged from a spider hole and ran. While the boat's gunner opened fire, wounding the VC in the leg, and while the other boats approached and offered cover fire, Kerry jumped from the boat to pursue the VC insurgent, subsequently killing him and capturing his loaded rocket launcher."}
