Cronin, and conservative Democrat Roger P. Durkin, who ran as an <a0_0>Independent<a0_0/>. A week after the primary, one poll put Kerry <a1_0>26-points<a1_0/> ahead of Cronin. His campaign called for a national health insurance system, discounted prescription drugs for the unemployed, <a4_0>a jobs programme to clean up the Merrimack River<a4_0/> and rent controls in Lowell and Lawrence. A major obstacle, however, was the district's leading newspaper, the <a2_0>conservative<a2_0/> The Sun. The paper editorialized against him. It also ran critical news stories about his out-of-state contributions and his \"carpetbagging\", because he had only moved into the district in April. Subsequently released \"Watergate\" Oval Office tape recordings of the Nixon White House showed that defeating Kerry's candidacy had attracted the personal attention of <a3_0>President Nixon<a3_0/>. Kerry himself asserts that Nixon sent operatives to Lowell to help derail his campaign."}
