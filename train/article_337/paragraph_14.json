Bush since the 2000 Presidential election (when he was accused of having used <a0_0>his father<a0_0/>'s political influence to gain entrance to <a1_0>the Texas Air National Guard<a1_0/>, thereby protecting himself from conscription into the United States Army, and possible service in the Vietnam War), John Kerry's contrasting status as a decorated Vietnam War veteran posed a problem for Bush's re-election campaign, which Republicans sought to counter <a2_0>by calling Kerry's war record into question<a2_0/>. As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, approximately 250 members of a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT, later renamed <a3_0>Swift Vets and POWs for Truth<a3_0/>) opposed Kerry's campaign. The group held press conferences, ran ads and endorsed a book questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards. The group included several members of Kerry's unit, such as Larry Thurlow, who commanded a swift boat alongside of Kerry's, and Stephen Gardner, who served on Kerry's boat. The campaign inspired the widely used political pejorative '<a4_0>swiftboating<a4_0/>', to describe an unfair or untrue political attack. Most of Kerry's former crewmates have stated that SBVT's allegations are false."}
