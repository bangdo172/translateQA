Sheehy, <a1_0>State Representative<a1_0/> <a2_0>Anthony R. DiFruscia<a2_0/>, John J. Desmond and Robert B. Kennedy. Kerry ran a \"very expensive, sophisticated campaign\", financed by out-of-state backers and supported by many young volunteers. DiFruscia's campaign headquarters shared the same building as Kerry's. On the eve of the September 19 primary, police found Kerry's younger brother <a4_0>Cameron<a4_0/> and campaign field director Thomas J. Vallely, breaking into where the building's telephone lines were located. They were arrested and charged with \"breaking and entering with the intent to commit grand larceny\", but the charges were dropped a year later. At the time of the incident, DiFruscia alleged that the two were trying to disrupt his get-out-the vote efforts. Vallely and Cameron Kerry maintained that they were only checking their own telephone lines because <a3_0>they had received an anonymous call warning that the Kerry lines would be cut<a3_0/>."}
