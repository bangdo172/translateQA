Earlier in the day, Kerry received a slight shrapnel wound <a1_0>in the buttocks<a1_0/> from <a2_0>blowing up a rice bunker<a2_0/>. Debarking some but not all of the passengers at a small village, the boats approached a fishing weir; one group of boats went around to the left of the weir, hugging the shore, and a group with Kerry's <a4_0>PCF-94<a4_0/> boat went around to the right, along the shoreline. A mine was detonated directly beneath the lead boat, <a3_0>PCF-3<a3_0/>, as it crossed the weir to the left, lifting PCF-3 \"about 2-3 ft out of water\"."}
