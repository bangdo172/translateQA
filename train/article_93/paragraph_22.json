The Z3 was built with <a2_0>2000<a2_0/> relays, implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of <a3_0>about 5\u201310 Hz<a3_0/>. Program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in <a4_0>64<a4_0/> words of memory or supplied from the keyboard. It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers. Replacement of the hard-to-implement decimal system (used in Charles Babbage's earlier design) by the simpler binary system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time. The Z3 was Turing complete."}
