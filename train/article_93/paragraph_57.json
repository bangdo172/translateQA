Each cell has a numbered \"address\" and can store <a0_0>a single number<a0_0/>. The computer can be instructed to \"put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357\" or to \"add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595.\" The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is <a1_0>the software's<a1_0/> responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers."}
