Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine. With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation. The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by <a0_0>Alan Turing<a0_0/> in his <a1_0>1936<a1_0/> paper. In <a2_0>1945<a2_0/> Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report \u2018Proposed Electronic Calculator\u2019 was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the <a4_0>University of Pennsylvania<a4_0/>, also circulated his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC in <a3_0>1945."}
