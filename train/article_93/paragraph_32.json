Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by <a1_0>1953<a1_0/>, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of <a2_0>valves<a2_0/> to generate its 125 kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of <a4_0>1955<a4_0/>, built by the <a3_0>electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell<a3_0/>."}
