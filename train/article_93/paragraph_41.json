Unlike natural languages, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into machine code by <a0_0>a compiler or an assembler<a0_0/> before being run, or translated directly at run time by <a1_0>an interpreter<a1_0/>. Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques."}
