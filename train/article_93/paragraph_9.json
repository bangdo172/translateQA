It is a hand-operated analog computer for <a1_0>doing multiplication and division.<a1_0/> As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions. <a2_0>Aviation<a2_0/> is one of the few fields where slide rules are still in widespread use, particularly for solving time\u2013distance problems in light aircraft. To save space and for ease of reading, these are typically circular devices rather than the classic linear slide rule shape. A popular example is the E6B."}
