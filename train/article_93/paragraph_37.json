A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second <a0_0>(gigaflops)<a0_0/> and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors."}
