All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand \u2014 this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, <a0_0><a1_0>Henry Babbage<a1_0/><a0_0/>, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in <a2_0>1888<a2_0/>.
