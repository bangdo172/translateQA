Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as <a1_0>\"jumps\"<a1_0/> and allow for loops (<a2_0>instructions that are repeated by the computer)<a2_0/> and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of control flow)."}
