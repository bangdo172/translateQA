It could add or subtract <a0_0>5000<a0_0/> times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of <a2_0>John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert<a2_0/> at the <a3_0>University of Pennsylvania<a3_0/>, <a1_0>ENIAC<a1_0/>'s development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of <a4_0>1945<a4_0/>. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors."}
