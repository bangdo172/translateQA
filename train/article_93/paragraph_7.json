The planisphere was a star chart invented by <a0_0>Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b<a0_0/> in the early 11th century. The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to <a1_0>Hipparchus<a1_0/>. A combination of <a2_0>the planisphere and dioptra<a2_0/>, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, <a4_0>Persia<a4_0/> in <a3_0>1235<a3_0/>. Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe, an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gear-wheels, circa 1000 AD."}
