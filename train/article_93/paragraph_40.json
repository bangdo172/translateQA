Instead, each <a0_0>basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function<a0_0/> and easy to remember \u2013 a mnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's assembly language. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called <a1_0>an assembler."}
