While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called <a0_0><a1_0>the flow of control<a1_0/><a0_0/> within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention."}
