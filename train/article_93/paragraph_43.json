{"qas": [{"question": "Assembly language that is translated into machine language is done by what type of computer?", "id": "56fdefbe19033b140034cde9", "answers": [{"text": "a compiler", "answer_start": 525}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Though considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract high-level programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually \"compiled\" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called <a0_0>a compiler<a0_0/>. High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various video game consoles."}
