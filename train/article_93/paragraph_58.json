Each byte is able to represent <a1_0>256 different numbers<a1_0/> (28 = 256); either from <a2_0>0 to 255 or \u2212128 to +127<a2_0/>. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in two's complement notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory."}
