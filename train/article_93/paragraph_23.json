The engineer Tommy Flowers, working at the <a0_0>Post Office Research Station<a0_0/> in <a1_0>London<a1_0/> in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange. Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation 5 years later, converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of vacuum tubes. In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E. Berry of <a4_0>Iowa State University<a4_0/> developed and tested the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer (ABC) in <a2_0>1942<a2_0/>, the first \"automatic electronic digital computer\". This design was also all-electronic and used <a3_0>about 300<a3_0/> vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory."}
