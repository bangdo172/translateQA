Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any computable function, and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example <a0_0>quantum computers<a0_0/> can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by <a1_0>quantum factoring<a1_0/>) very quickly."}
