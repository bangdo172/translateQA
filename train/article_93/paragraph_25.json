It used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data, but it was not Turing-complete. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained <a1_0>1500 thermionic valves (tubes)<a1_0/>, but Mark II with <a2_0>2400<a2_0/> valves, was both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark 1, greatly speeding the decoding process."}
