Each circuit represents <a0_0>a bit (binary digit) of information<a0_0/> so that when the circuit is <a1_0>on<a1_0/> it represents a \"1\", and when <a2_0>off<a2_0/> it represents a \"0\" (in positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits."}
