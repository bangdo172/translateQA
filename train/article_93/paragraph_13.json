Considered the \"father of the computer\", he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the <a2_0>early 19th century<a2_0/>. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in <a3_0>1833<a3_0/> he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete."}
