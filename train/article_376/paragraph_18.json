The violent conflict finally concluded with the Treaty of Alexandropol on <a0_0>2 December 1920<a0_0/>. The treaty forced Armenia to disarm most of its military forces, cede all former Ottoman territory granted to it by the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, and to give up all the \"Wilsonian Armenia\" granted to it at the S\u00e8vres treaty. Simultaneously, the Soviet Eleventh Army, under the command of <a2_0>Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze<a2_0/>, invaded Armenia at Karavansarai (present-day Ijevan) on 29 November. By <a3_0>4 December<a3_0/>, Ordzhonikidze's forces entered Yerevan and the short-lived Armenian republic collapsed."}
