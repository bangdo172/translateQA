The war was a success for the <a4_0>Karabakh Armenian forces<a4_0/> who managed to capture 16% of Azerbaijan's internationally recognised territory including Nagorno-Karabakh itself. Since then, Armenia and Azerbaijan have held peace talks, mediated by the <a1_0>Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe<a1_0/> (OSCE). The status of Karabakh has yet to be determined. The economies of both countries have been hurt in the absence of a complete resolution and Armenia's borders with <a2_0>Turkey and Azerbaijan<a2_0/> remain closed.
