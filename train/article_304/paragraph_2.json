As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the Alaska Purchase. The region is dominated by the Alexander Archipelago as well as the <a0_0><b4_0><b5_0>Tongass National Forest<b5_0/><b4_0/><a0_0/>, the largest national forest in the United States. It contains the state capital Juneau, the former capital <a1_0><b6_0>Sitka<b6_0/><a1_0/>, and Ketchikan, at one time Alaska's largest city. The Alaska Marine Highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area, as only three communities (Haines, Hyder and Skagway) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system."}
