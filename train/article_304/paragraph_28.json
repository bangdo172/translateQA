In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Though most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0>50\u00a2 per pound<b6_0/><b5_0/> ($1.10/kg)<a1_0/> or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a 1 US gallon (3.8 L) of milk is about <a3_0><b8_0>$3.50<b8_0/><a3_0/> in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely 20\u201330\u00a2 higher than the continental United States average, with only <a2_0><b7_0>Hawaii<b7_0/><a2_0/> having higher prices."}
