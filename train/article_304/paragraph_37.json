The race commemorates <a2_0><b8_0>the famous 1925 serum run to Nome<b8_0/><a2_0/> in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when <a3_0>all other means of transportation had failed<a3_0/>. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The <a4_0>\"<b9_0>Serum Run<b9_0/>\"<a4_0/> is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome."}
