The association of slavery with a \"race\" led to slavery as a racial caste. But, most families of free people of color formed in Virginia before the American Revolution were the descendants of unions between <b7_0>white women and African men<b7_0/>, who frequently worked and lived together in the looser conditions of the early colonial period. While interracial marriage was later prohibited, <b8_0>white men<b8_0/> frequently took sexual advantage of slave women, and numerous generations of multiracial children were born. By the late 1800s it had become common among African Americans to use passing to <b9_0>gain educational opportunities<b9_0/> as did the first African-American graduate of Vassar College <a2_0>Anita Florence Hemmings<a2_0/>. Some 19th-century categorization schemes defined people by proportion of African ancestry: a person whose <a3_0>parents were black and white<a3_0/> was classified as mulatto, with one black grandparent and three white as quadroon, and with <a4_0>one black great-grandparent and the remainder white<a4_0/> as octoroon. The latter categories remained within an overall black or colored category, but before the Civil War, in Virginia and some other states, a person of one-eighth or less black ancestry was legally white. Some members of these categories passed temporarily or permanently as white."}
