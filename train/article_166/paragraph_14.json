A person who is one-fourth or less American Indian or Korean or Filipino is not regarded as passing if he or she intermarries with and joins fully the life of the dominant community, so the minority ancestry need not be hidden. ... It is often suggested that the key reason for this is that the physical differences between these other groups and whites are less pronounced than the <b4_0>physical differences<b4_0/> between <a1_0>African blacks and whites<a1_0/>, and therefore are <a2_0>less threatening to whites<a2_0/>. ... <b5_0>[W]hen ancestry in one of these racial minority groups does not <a0_0>exceed one-fourth<b5_0/><a0_0/>, a person is not defined solely as a member of that group."}
