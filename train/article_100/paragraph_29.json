Most decoders are \"<a1_0>bitstream compliant<a1_0/>\", which means that the decompressed output that they produce from a given MP3 file will be the same, within a <a2_0>specified degree of rounding tolerance<a2_0/>, as the output specified mathematically in the ISO/IEC high standard document (ISO/IEC 11172-3). Therefore, comparison of decoders is usually based on how <a3_0>computationally efficient<a3_0/> they are (i.e., how much memory or <a4_0>CPU time<a4_0/> they use in the decoding process)."}
