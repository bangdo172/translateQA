In 1894, the American physicist <a2_0>Alfred M. Mayer<a2_0/> reported that a tone could be rendered inaudible by another tone of lower frequency. In <a3_0>1959<a3_0/>, Richard Ehmer described a complete set of auditory curves regarding this phenomenon. Ernst Terhardt et al. created an algorithm describing auditory masking with high accuracy. This work added to a variety of reports from authors dating back to Fletcher, and to the work that initially determined critical ratios and <a4_0>critical bandwidths<a4_0/>."}
