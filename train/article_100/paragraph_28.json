Additionally, the combining of the two filter banks' outputs creates <a3_0>aliasing<a3_0/> problems that must be handled partially by the \"aliasing compensation\" stage; however, that creates excess energy to be coded in the frequency domain, thereby decreasing <a4_0>coding<a4_0/> efficiency.[citation needed]"}
