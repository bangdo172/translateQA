This sequence of frames is called an <a1_0>elementary stream<a1_0/>. Due to the \"byte reservoir\", frames are not independent items and cannot usually be extracted on arbitrary frame boundaries. The MP3 Data blocks contain the (compressed) audio information in terms of frequencies and amplitudes. The diagram shows that the MP3 Header consists of a sync word, which is used to identify the beginning of a valid frame. This is followed by a bit indicating that this is the MPEG stan<a2_0>dard<a2_0/> and <a3_0>two<a3_0/> bits that indicate that layer 3 is used; hence MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 or MP3. After this, the values will differ, depending on the MP3 file. ISO/IEC 11172-3 defines the range of values for each section of the header along with the specification of the header. Most MP3 files today contain <a4_0>ID3<a4_0/> metadata, which precedes or follows the MP3 frames, as noted in the diagram."}
