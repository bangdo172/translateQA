MPEG-2 Audio Layer III allows bit rates of 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160 kbit/s with sampling frequencies of 16, 22.05 and 24 kHz. MPEG-2.5 Audio Layer III is restricted to bit rates of 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64 kbit/s with sampling frequencies of 8, 11.025, and 12 kHz.[citation needed] Because of the <a0_0>Nyquist\u2013Shannon<a0_0/> sampling theorem, frequency reproduction is always strictly <a1_0>less than half<a1_0/> of the sampling frequency, and <a2_0>imperfect filters<a2_0/> requires a larger margin for error (noise level versus sharpness of filter), so 8 kHz sampling rate limits the maximum frequency to <a3_0>4 kHz<a3_0/>, while <a4_0>48<a4_0/> kHz maximum sampling rate limits an MP3 to 24 kHz sound reproduction."}
