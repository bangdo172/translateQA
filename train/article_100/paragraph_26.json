At present, these suggested implementations are quite dated. Implementers of the standard were supposed to devise <a2_0>their own algorithms<a2_0/> suitable for removing parts of the information from the audio input. As a result, there are many different MP3 encoders available, each producing files of differing quality. <a3_0>Comparisons are widely available<a3_0/>, so it is easy for a prospective user of an encoder to research the best choice. An encoder that is proficient at encoding at higher bit rates (such as LAME) is not necessarily as good at <a4_0>lower bit rates<a4_0/>."}
