The various MP3-related patents expire on dates ranging from 2007 to <a2_0>2017<a2_0/> in the U.S. Patents filed for anything disclosed in ISO CD 11172 a year or more after its publication are questionable. If only the known MP3 patents filed by December 1992 are considered, then MP3 decoding has been patent-free in the US since 22 September 2015 when U.S. Patent 5,812,672 expired which had a PCT filing in October 1992. If the longest-running patent mentioned in the aforementioned references is taken as a measure, then the MP3 technology will be patent-free in the United States on 30 December 2017 when U.S. Patent 5,703,999, held by the <a3_0>Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft<a3_0/> and administered by <a4_0>Technicolor<a4_0/>, expires."}
