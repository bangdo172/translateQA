MPEG audio may use bitrate switching on a per-frame basis, but only <a1_0>layer III<a1_0/> decoders must support it. VBR is used when the goal is to achieve a fixed level of quality. The <a3_0>final file size<a3_0/> of a <a2_0>VBR<a2_0/> encoding is less predictable than with constant bitrate. Average bitrate is VBR implemented as a compromise between the two: the bitrate is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near an average value chosen by <a4_0>the user<a4_0/>, for predictable file sizes. Although an MP3 decoder must support VBR to be standards compliant, historically some decoders have bugs with VBR decoding, particularly before VBR encoders became widespread."}
