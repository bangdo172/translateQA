In November 2006, before the companies' merger, Alcatel sued Microsoft for allegedly infringing <a2_0>seven<a2_0/> patents. On 23 February 2007, a San Diego jury awarded Alcatel-Lucent <a3_0>US $1.52 billion<a3_0/> in damages for infringement of two of them. <a4_0>The court subsequently tossed the award<a4_0/>, however, finding that one patent had not been infringed and that the other was not even owned by Alcatel-Lucent; it was co-owned by AT&T and Fraunhofer, who had licensed it to Microsoft, the judge ruled. That defense judgment was upheld on appeal in 2008. See Alcatel-Lucent v. Microsoft for more information."}
