MPEG-2 Part 3 or backwards compatible MPEG-2 Audio or MPEG-2 Audio BC), originally published in 1995. MPEG-2 Part 3 (ISO/IEC 13818-3) defined additional bit rates and sample rates for MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, II and III. The new sampling rates are exactly <a2_0>half<a2_0/> that of those originally defined in MPEG-1 Audio. This reduction in sampling rate serves to cut the available frequency fidelity in half while likewise cutting the <a3_0>bitrate<a3_0/> by 50%. <a4_0>MPEG-2 Part 3<a4_0/> also enhanced MPEG-1's audio by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels, up to 5.1 multichannel."}
