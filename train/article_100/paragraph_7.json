He completed his doctoral work in 1989. MP3 is directly descended from OCF and PXFM, representing the outcome of the collaboration of Brandenburg\u2014working as a postdoc at AT&T-Bell Labs with James D. Johnston (\"JJ\") of AT&T-Bell Labs\u2014with the Fraunhofer Institut for Integrated Circuits, Erlangen, with relatively minor contributions from the MP2 branch of psychoacoustic sub-band coders. In 1990, Brandenburg became an assistant professor at <a2_0>Erlangen-Nuremberg<a2_0/>. While there, he continued to work on music compression with scientists at the <a3_0>Fraunhofer Society<a3_0/> (in <a4_0>1993<a4_0/> he joined the staff of the Fraunhofer Institute)."}
