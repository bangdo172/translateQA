This extension was developed at <a1_0>Fraunhofer IIS<a1_0/>, the registered MP3 patent holders. Like MPEG-2, MPEG-2.5 adds new sampling rates exactly half of that previously possible with MPEG-2. It thus widens the scope of MP3 to include <a2_0>human speech<a2_0/> and other applications requiring only 25% of the frequency reproduction possible with MPEG-1. While not an ISO recognized standard, <a3_0>MPEG-2.5<a3_0/> is widely supported by both inexpensive and brand name digital audio players as well as computer software based MP3 encoders and decoders. A sample rate comparison between MPEG-1, 2 and 2.5 is given further down. MPEG-2.5 was not developed by MPEG and was never approved as an international standard. MPEG-2.5 is thus an unofficial or <a4_0>proprietary<a4_0/> extension to the MP3 format."}
