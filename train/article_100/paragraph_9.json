The Musicam technique, as proposed by Philips (the <a2_0>Netherlands<a2_0/>), CCETT (France) and Institut f\u00fcr Rundfunktechnik (Germany) was chosen due to its simplicity and <a3_0>error robustness<a3_0/>, as well as its low computational power associated with the encoding of high quality compressed audio. The Musicam format, based on <a4_0>sub-band coding<a4_0/>, was the basis of the MPEG Audio compression format (sampling rates, structure of frames, headers, number of samples per frame)."}
