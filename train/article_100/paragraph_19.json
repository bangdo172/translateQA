The filename extension <a2_0>.mp3<a2_0/> was chosen by the Fraunhofer team on 14 July 1995 (previously, the files had been named .bit). With the first real-time software MP3 player <a3_0>WinPlay3<a3_0/> (released 9 September 1995) many people were able to encode and play back MP3 files on their PCs. Because of the relatively small hard drives back in that time (~ 500\u2013<a4_0>1000 MB<a4_0/>) lossy compression was essential to store non-instrument based (see tracker and MIDI) music for playback on computer."}
