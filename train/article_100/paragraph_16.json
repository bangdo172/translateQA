Nevertheless, <a3_0>compression ratios<a3_0/> are often published. They may use the <a2_0>Compact Disc<a2_0/> (CD) parameters as references (44.1 kHz, 2 channels at 16 bits per channel or 2\u00d716 bit), or sometimes the <a4_0>Digital Audio Tape (DAT) SP<a4_0/> parameters (48 kHz, 2\u00d716 bit). Compression ratios with this latter reference are higher, which demonstrates the problem with use of the term compression ratio for lossy encoders."}
