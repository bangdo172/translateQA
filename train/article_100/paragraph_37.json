In 2015, he released the track \"moDernisT\" (an anagram of \"<a2_0>Tom's Diner<a2_0/>\"), composed exclusively from the sounds deleted during MP3 compression of the song \"Tom's Diner\", the track originally used in the formulation of the MP3 standard. A detailed account of the techniques used to isolate the sounds deleted during MP3 compression, along with the conceptual motivation for the project, was published in the <a4_0>2014<a4_0/> Proceedings of the <a3_0>International Computer Music Conference<a3_0/>."}
