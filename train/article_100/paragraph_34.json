Using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and faster. However, it is also possible to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file. These are known as <a2_0>Variable Bit Rate<a2_0/> (VBR) files. The idea behind this is that, in any piece of audio, some parts will be much easier to compress, such as silence or <a3_0>music containing only a few instruments<a3_0/>, while others will be more difficult to compress. So, the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts. With some encoders, it is possible to specify a given quality, and the encoder will vary the bit rate accordingly. Users who know a particular \"<a4_0>quality setting<a4_0/>\" that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music, and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate."}
