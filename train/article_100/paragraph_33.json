As the MP3 standard allows quite a bit of freedom with <a1_0>encoding algorithms<a1_0/>, different encoders may feature quite different quality, even with identical <a2_0>bit rates<a2_0/>. As an example, in a public listening test featuring two different MP3 encoders at about 128 kbit/s, one scored 3.66 on a 1\u2013<a4_0>5<a4_0/> scale, while the other scored only <a3_0>2.22<a3_0/>."}
