This song was chosen because of its nearly <a2_0>monophonic<a2_0/> nature and wide spectral content, making it easier to hear imperfections in the compression format during playbacks. Some refer to Suzanne Vega as \"<a3_0>The mother of MP3<a3_0/>\". This particular track has an interesting property in that the two channels are almost, but not completely, the same, leading to a case where Binaural Masking Level Depression causes spatial unmasking of noise artifacts unless the encoder properly recognizes the situation and applies corrections similar to those detailed in the MPEG-2 AAC psychoacoustic model. Some more critical audio excerpts (glockenspiel, triangle, accordion, etc.) were taken from the <a4_0>EBU V3/SQAM<a4_0/> reference compact disc and have been used by professional sound engineers to assess the subjective quality of the MPEG Audio formats."}
