Estonians still call their capital \"Tallinn\", which according to legend derives from Taani linna (meaning Danish town or castle). Reval was granted L\u00fcbeck city rights (<a3_0>1248<a3_0/>) and joined the Hanseatic League. Even today, Danish influence can be seen in heraldic symbols. The Danish cross is on the city of Tallinn's coat of arms, and Estonia's coat of arms displays three lions similar to those found on the Danish coat of arms."}
