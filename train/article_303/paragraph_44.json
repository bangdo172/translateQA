In 2011 <a1_0>about 85%<a1_0/> of it was generated with locally mined oil shale. Alternative energy sources such as <a2_0>wood, peat, and biomass<a2_0/> make up approximately 9% of primary energy production. Renewable wind energy was about <a3_0>6%<a3_0/> of total consumption in 2009. Estonia imports petroleum products from western Europe and Russia. Oil shale energy, telecommunications, textiles, chemical products, banking, services, food and fishing, timber, shipbuilding, electronics, and transportation are key sectors of the economy. The ice-free port of Muuga, near Tallinn, is a modern facility featuring good transshipment capability, a high-capacity grain elevator, chill/frozen storage, and new oil tanker off-loading capabilities.[citation needed] The railroad serves as a conduit between the West, Russia, and other points to the East.[citation needed]"}
