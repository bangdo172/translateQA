Instead the vote to join the Soviet Union was taken by those elected in the <a3_0>elections<a3_0/> held the previous month. Additionally those who had failed to do their \"political duty\" of voting Estonia into the USSR, specifically those who had failed to have their passports stamped for voting, were condemned to death by Soviet tribunals. The repressions followed with the mass deportations carried out by the Soviets in Estonia on 14 June 1941. Many of the country's political and intellectual leaders were killed or deported to remote areas of the USSR by the Soviet authorities in 1940\u20131941. Repressive actions were also taken against thousands of ordinary people."}
