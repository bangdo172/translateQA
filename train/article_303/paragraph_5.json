Among the casualties of this raid was the <a2_0>Swedish archbishop Johannes<a2_0/>. The city remained occupied for some time, contributing to its decline as a center of commerce in the 13th century and the rise of Uppsala, Visby, Kalmar and Stockholm. The Livonian Chronicle describes the Oeselians as using two kinds of ships, <a3_0>the piratica and the liburna<a3_0/>. The former was a warship, the latter mainly a <a4_0>merchant ship<a4_0/>. A piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead and a rectangular sail. Viking-age treasures from Estonia mostly contain silver coins and bars. Saaremaa has the richest finds of Viking treasures after Gotland in Sweden. This strongly suggests that Estonia was an important transit country during the Viking era."}
