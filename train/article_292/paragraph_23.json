Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the <b5_0>house<b5_0/>, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the <b6_0>Royal Assent Act 1967<b6_0/> <a0_0>does not require both houses to meet jointly<a0_0/> for the purpose of receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in <a2_0>The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992<a2_0/>, with minor amendments in <a3_0>2000<a3_0/>. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by the wording of the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by the wording of the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act (\"... And forasmuch as We cannot at this time be present in the Higher House of Our said Parliament being the accustomed place for giving Our Royal Assent...\")."}
