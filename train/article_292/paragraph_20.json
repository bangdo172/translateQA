In <b4_0>1542<b4_0/>, Henry sought to execute his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, whom he accused of <a0_0>committing adultery<a0_0/>; the execution was to be authorised not after a trial but by a bill of attainder, to which he would have to personally assent after <a1_0>listening to the entire text<a1_0/>. Henry decided that \"the repetition of so grievous a Story and the recital of so infamous a crime\" in his presence \"might reopen a Wound already closing in the Royal Bosom\". Therefore, parliament inserted a clause into the Act of <b6_0>Attainder<b6_0/>, providing that assent granted by Commissioners \"is and ever was and ever shall be, as good\" as assent granted by the sovereign personally. The procedure was used only <a2_0>five<a2_0/> times during the 16th century, but more often during the 17th and 18th centuries, especially when George III's health began to deteriorate. <a3_0>Queen Victoria<a3_0/> became the last <b7_0>monarch<b7_0/> to personally grant assent in 1854."}
