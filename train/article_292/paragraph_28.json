The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony.

In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the <a2_0>Clerk of the Senate<a2_0/> states: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\" If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the <a3_0>governor general<a3_0/>, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills. <a1_0>The governor general or his or her deputy<a1_0/> then depart parliament."}
