When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, <b4_0>have <a1_0>notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent<b4_0/><a1_0/>. Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective <a2_0>when <b5_0>the second announcement is made<b5_0/><a2_0/>. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect <b6_0>on the date on which it receives royal assent<b6_0/> and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent."}
