The monarch promulgates the law, meaning that he or she formally orders that the law be officially published and executed. In <b5_0><b7_0>1990<b7_0/><b5_0/>, when <a2_0>King Baudouin<a2_0/> advised his cabinet he could not, in conscience, sign a bill decriminalising abortion (a refusal patently not covered by a responsible minister), the <a1_0>Council of Ministers<a1_0/>, at the King's own request, declared Baudouin incapable of exercising his powers. In accordance with the Belgian constitution, upon the declaration of the sovereign's incapacity, the Council of Ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the King's incapacity and appoint a regent. The bill was then assented to by all members of the Council of Ministers \"on behalf of the Belgian People\".
