London's average July high is <a1_0>24 \u00b0C (75.2 \u00b0F)<a1_0/>. On average London will see <a3_0>31<a3_0/> days above 25 \u00b0C (77.0 \u00b0F) each year, and 4.2 days above 30.0 \u00b0C (86.0 \u00b0F) every year. During the 2003 European heat wave there were 14 consecutive days above 30 \u00b0C (86.0 \u00b0F) and 2 consecutive days where temperatures reached 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), leading to hundreds of heat related deaths. Winters are generally cool and damp with little temperature variation. <a4_0>Snowfall<a4_0/> does occur from time to time, and can cause travel disruption when this happens. Spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable <a2_0>urban heat island effect<a2_0/>, making the centre of London at times 5 \u00b0C (9 \u00b0F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts. The effect of this can be seen below when comparing London Heathrow, <a0_0>15 miles west<a0_0/> of London, with the London Weather Centre, in the city centre."}
