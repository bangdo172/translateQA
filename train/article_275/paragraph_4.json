The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium with the modern Welsh <a2_0>Llundain<a2_0/>, which should demand a form *(h)l\u014dndinion (as opposed to *lond\u012bnion), from earlier *loundiniom. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date, and thus cannot be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name."}
