Standing on the <a1_0>River Thames<a1_0/> in the south eastern part of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it <a2_0>Londinium<a2_0/>. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its <a4_0>1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2)<a4_0/> medieval boundaries and in 2011 had a resident population of <a0_0>7,375<a0_0/>, making it the smallest city in England. Since at least the 19th century, the term London has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of this conurbation forms Greater London,[note 1] a region of England governed by <a3_0>the Mayor of London and the London Assembly<a3_0/>.[note 2] The conurbation also covers two English counties: the small district of the City of London and the county of Greater London. The latter constitutes the vast majority of London, though historically it was split between Middlesex (a now abolished county), Essex, Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire."}
