This provided the foundation for subsequent Slavic states to arise on the former territory of this realm with <a2_0>Carantania<a2_0/> being the oldest of them. Very old also are the Principality of Nitra and the Moravian principality (see under Great Moravia). In this period, there existed central Slavic groups and states such as the Balaton Principality, but the subsequent expansion of the Magyars, as well as the Germanisation of Austria, separated the northern and southern Slavs. The First Bulgarian Empire was founded in <a3_0><b9_0>681<b9_0/><a3_0/>, the Slavic language <b8_0>Old Bulgarian<b8_0/> became the main and official of the empire in 864. Bulgaria was instrumental in the spread of <a4_0>Slavic literacy and Christianity<a4_0/> to the rest of the Slavic world."}
