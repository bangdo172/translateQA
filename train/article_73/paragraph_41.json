Malyarchuk found Czech mtDNA lineages were typical of \"<a2_0>Slavic populations<a2_0/>\" with \"<b9_0>1.8%<b9_0/>\" Mongoloid mtDNA lineage. Malyarchuk added that \"Slavic populations\" \"almost always\" contain Mongoloid mtDNA lineage. Malyarchuk said the Mongoloid component of Slavic people was partially added before the split of \"Balto-Slavics\" in <b7_0>2,000\u20133,000 BC<b7_0/> with additional Mongoloid mixture occurring among Slavics in the last 4,000 years. Malyarchuk said the \"Russian population\" was developed by the \"assimilation of <b6_0>the indigenous pre-Slavic population<b6_0/> of Eastern Europe by true Slavs\" with additional \"assimilation of Finno-Ugric populations\" and \"long-lasting\" interactions with the populations of \"Siberia\" and \"Central Asia\". <a3_0>Malyarchuk said that other Slavs \"Mongoloid component\" was increased during the waves of migration from \"<a4_0>steppe populations<a4_0/><a3_0/> (Huns, Avars, Bulgars and Mongols)\", especially the decay of the \"Avar Khaganate\"."}
