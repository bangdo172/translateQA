Working with haplotypes, they found a pattern among Western Slavs which turned out to correspond to a newly discovered marker, <b7_0>M458<b7_0/>, which defines subclade R1a1a7. This marker correlates remarkably well with the distribution of Slavic-speakers today. The team led by <a2_0>Peter Underhill<a2_0/>, which discovered M458, did not consider the possibility that this was <b5_0>a Slavic marker<b5_0/>, since they used the \"evolutionary effective\" mutation rate, which gave a date far too old to be Slavic. Wo\u017aniak and colleagues pointed out that the pedigree mutation rate, giving a later date, is more consistent with <b6_0>the archaeological record<b6_0/>."}
