Examples of nonverbal communication include haptic communication, chronemic communication, gestures, <a1_0>body language<a1_0/>, facial expression, eye contact, and how one dresses. <b6_0>Nonverbal communication<b6_0/> also relates to intent of a message. Examples of intent are voluntary, intentional movements like <a2_0>shaking a hand<a2_0/> or winking, as well as involuntary, such as <a3_0>sweating<a3_0/>. Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress. There may even be a pheromone component. Research has shown that up to <a4_0><b8_0>55%<b8_0/><a4_0/> of human communication may occur through <b5_0>non-verbal facial expressions<b5_0/>, and a further 38% through paralanguage. It affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes <b7_0>trust<b7_0/>. Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion."}
