Fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote, plants and insects <a1_0>through biochemicals of biotic origin<a1_0/>. The <b8_0>biochemicals<b8_0/> trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that <b6_0>fungal organisms<b6_0/> can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far <a2_0><b7_0>five<b7_0/><a2_0/> different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate <b5_0>different behavioral patterns<b5_0/> such as filamentation, mating, growth, and pathogenicity. Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through <a3_0>interpretation processes<a3_0/> that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out \"noise\", i.e. <a4_0><b9_0>similar molecules without biotic content<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
