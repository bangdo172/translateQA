This second attitude of communication, referred to as <b6_0>the <a1_0>constitutive model or constructionist view<b6_0/><a1_0/>, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as <a2_0>a conduit<a2_0/>; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called <b7_0>a speech act<b7_0/>. The sender's <b8_0><b9_0>personal filters<b9_0/><b8_0/> and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon <a3_0>different regional traditions<a3_0/>, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents. In the presence of \"<a4_0>communication noise<a4_0/>\" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a codebook, and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical. Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in <b5_0>the model<b5_0/>, which creates many conceptual difficulties."}
