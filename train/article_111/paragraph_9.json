Plant <a1_0>roots<a1_0/> communicate with <b5_0>rhizome bacteria, fungi, and insects<b5_0/> within the soil. These interactions are governed by syntactic, pragmatic, and semantic rules,[citation needed] and are possible because of <a2_0>the decentralized \"<b6_0>nervous<b6_0/> system\" of plants<a2_0/>. The original meaning of the word \"neuron\" in Greek is \"<a3_0><b7_0>vegetable fiber<b7_0/><a3_0/>\" and recent research has shown that most of the microorganism plant communication processes are neuron-like. Plants also communicate <a4_0>via <b8_0>volatiles<b8_0/><a4_0/> when exposed to herbivory attack behavior, thus warning neighboring plants. In parallel they produce other volatiles to attract parasites which attack these herbivores. In stress situations plants can overwrite the <b9_0>genomes<b9_0/> they inherited from their parents and revert to that of their grand- or great-grandparents.[citation needed]"}
