In <a1_0>1960<a1_0/>, <a0_0>Ali Javan<a0_0/> co-invented the first gas laser, and fuzzy set theory was introduced by Lotfi Zadeh. Iranian cardiologist, <a2_0>Tofy Mussivand<a2_0/> invented and developed the first artificial cardiac pump, the precursor of the artificial heart. Furthering research and treatment of diabetes, HbA1c was discovered by <a3_0>Samuel Rahbar<a3_0/>. Iranian physics is especially strong in string theory, with many papers being published in Iran. Iranian-American string theorist Kamran Vafa proposed the Vafa-Witten theorem together with Edward Witten. In August 2014, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first-ever woman, as well as the first-ever Iranian, to receive <a4_0>the Fields Medal<a4_0/>, the highest prize in mathematics."}
