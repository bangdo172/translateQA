Turkic tribesmen were first used in the Abbasid army as <a2_0>mamluks (slave-warriors)<a2_0/>, replacing Iranian and Arab elements within the army. As a result, the mamluks gained a significant political power. In <a3_0>999<a3_0/>, large portions of Iran came briefly under the rule of the Ghaznavids, whose rulers were of mamluk Turk origin, and longer subsequently under the Turkish Seljuk and Khwarezmian empires. <a4_0>These Turks had been Persianized and had adopted Persian models of administration and rulership<a4_0/>. The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia, while taking their thoroughly Persianized identity with them. The result of the adoption and patronage of Persian culture by Turkish rulers was the development of a distinct Turko-Persian tradition."}
