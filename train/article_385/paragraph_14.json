Initially defeated by the <a2_0>Arab Rashidun Caliphate<a2_0/>, Iran came under the rule of the Arab caliphates of Umayyad and Abbasid. The prolonged and gradual process of the Islamization of Iran began following the conquest. Under the new Arab elite of the Rashidun and later the Umayyad caliphates, both converted (mawali) and non-converted (dhimmi) Iranians were discriminated against, being excluded from the government and military, and having to pay a special tax called <a3_0>Jizya<a3_0/>. Gunde Shapur, home of the <a4_0>Academy of Gunde Shapur<a4_0/> which was the most important medical center of the world at the time, survived after the invasion, but became known as an Islamic institute thereafter."}
