He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of \"<a0_0><b3_0>elementary ideas<b3_0/><a0_0/>\" (Elementargedanken); different cultures, or different \"folk ideas\" (<b6_0>V\u00f6lkergedanken<b6_0/>), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.
