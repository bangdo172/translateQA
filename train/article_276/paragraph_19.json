In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to <a2_0><b7_0>matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender<b7_0/><a2_0/>.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (<a3_0>a process called globalization<a3_0/>), cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony.[citation needed] <b6_0>Globalization<b6_0/> in this context can be defined as western civilization in other ways, it undermines the cultural integrity of other culture and it is therefore repressive, exploitative and harmful to most people in different places."}
