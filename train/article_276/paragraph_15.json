Cultural sociology was then \"reinvented\" in the English-speaking world as a product of the \"cultural turn\" of the 1960s, which ushered in structuralist and postmodern approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may loosely be regarded as an approach incorporating cultural analysis and critical theory. <b5_0>Cultural<b5_0/> sociologists tend to reject <a2_0>scientific methods<a2_0/>,[citation needed] instead hermeneutically focusing on words, artifacts and symbols. \"<b6_0>Culture<b6_0/>\" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like social stratification and social network analysis. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of social psychology and cognitive science. \"Cultural sociology\" is one of the largest sections of the American Sociological Association. The British establishment of cultural studies means the latter is often taught as a loosely distinct discipline in the UK."}
