For <a0_0><b4_0>Georg Simmel<b4_0/><a0_0/> (1858\u20131918), culture referred to \"the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history\". Culture in the sociological field can be defined as the <a1_0><b5_0>ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects<b5_0/><a1_0/> that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, non-material culture or material culture. Non-material culture refers to the <a2_0><b6_0>non physical ideas<b6_0/><a2_0/> that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief system, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions. While Material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make, or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in <a3_0><b7_0>archeological and anthropological studies<b7_0/><a3_0/>, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture past or present."}
