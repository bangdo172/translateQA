The country previously had to rely on expensive satellite links due to the civil conflict, which limited internet usage. However, residents now have access to <a1_0>broadband<a1_0/> internet cable for the first time after an agreement reached between Hormuud Telecom and Liquid Telecom. The deal will see Liquid Telecom link Hormuud to its <b6_0>17,000 km (<a2_0>10,500 mile<a2_0/>)<b6_0/> network of terrestrial cables, which will deliver faster internet capacity. The fiber optic connection will also make online access <a3_0>more affordable<a3_0/> to the average user. This in turn is expected to further increase the number of internet users. Dalkom Somalia reached a similar agreement with the <b7_0>West Indian Ocean Cable Company<b7_0/> (WIOCC) Ltd, which it holds shares in. Effective the first quarter of <b8_0>2014<b8_0/>, the deal will establish fiber optic connectivity to and from Somalia via the EASSy cable. The new services are expected to reduce the cost of international bandwidth and to better optimize performance, thereby further broadening internet access. Dalkom Somalia is concurrently constructing a 1,000 square mile state-of-the-art data center in <a4_0><b9_0>Mogadishu<b9_0/><a4_0/>. The site will facilitate direct connection into the international fiber optic network by hosting equipment for all of the capital's ISPs and telecommunication companies."}
