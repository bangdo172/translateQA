Thrombolysis agents include <b0_0>streptokinase, reteplase, alteplase, and tenecteplase<b0_0/>. If no contraindications are present (such as <b1_0>a high risk of bleeding<b1_0/>), thrombolysis can be given in the pre-hospital or in-hospital setting. When given to people suspected of having a STEMI within <b4_0>6<b4_0/> hours of the onset of symptoms, thrombolytic drugs save the life of <b2_0>1 in 43<b2_0/> who received them. The risks were major bleeding (<b3_0>1 in 143<b3_0/>) and brain bleeding (1 in 250). It is unclear whether pre-hospital thrombolysis reduces death in people with STEMI compared to in-hospital thrombolysis. Pre-hospital thrombolysis reduces time to thrombolytic treatment, based on studies conducted in higher income countries."}
