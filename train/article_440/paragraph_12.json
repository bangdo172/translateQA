The difference in conduction velocity between injured and uninjured tissue can trigger <b3_0>re-entry or a feedback loop<b3_0/> that is believed to be the cause of many lethal arrhythmias. The most serious of these arrhythmias is ventricular fibrillation (<b1_0>V-Fib/VF<b1_0/>), an extremely fast and chaotic heart rhythm that is the leading cause of <b2_0>sudden cardiac death<b2_0/>. Another life-threatening arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia (V-tach/VT), which can cause sudden cardiac death. However, VT usually results in rapid heart rates that prevent the heart from pumping blood effectively. Cardiac output and blood pressure may fall to dangerous levels, which can lead to further <b4_0>coronary ischemia<b4_0/> and extension of the infarct."}
