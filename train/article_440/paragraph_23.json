Acute complications may include heart failure if the damaged heart is no longer able to pump blood adequately around the body; aneurysm of the left ventricle myocardium; <b1_0>ventricular septal rupture or free wall rupture<b1_0/>; mitral regurgitation, in particular if the infarction causes <b2_0>dysfunction of the papillary muscle<b2_0/>; Dressler's syndrome; and <b0_0>abnormal heart rhythms<b0_0/>, such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and heart block. Longer-term complications include heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and an increased risk of a second MI."}
