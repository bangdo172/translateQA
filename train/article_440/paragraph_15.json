Thallium may also be used to determine viability of tissue, distinguishing <b2_0>whether nonfunctional myocardium is actually dead or merely in a state of hibernation<b2_0/> or of being stunned. Medical societies and professional guidelines recommend that the physician confirm <b3_0>a person is at high risk for myocardial infarction<b3_0/> before conducting imaging tests to make a diagnosis. Patients who have a normal ECG and who are able to exercise, for example, do not merit routine imaging. Imaging tests such as stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging or stress echocardiography can confirm a diagnosis when a patient's history, physical exam, ECG, and <b4_0>cardiac<b4_0/> biomarkers suggest the likelihood of a problem."}
