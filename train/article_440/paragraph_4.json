Other symptoms include <b0_0>diaphoresis<b0_0/> (an excessive form of sweating), weakness, light-headedness, nausea, vomiting, and palpitations. These symptoms are likely induced by a massive surge of <b1_0>catecholamines<b1_0/> from the <b2_0>sympathetic<b2_0/> nervous system, which occurs in response to pain and the blood flow abnormalities that result from dysfunction of the heart muscle. Loss of consciousness (due to inadequate blood flow to the brain and <b4_0>cardiogenic<b4_0/> shock) and sudden death (frequently due to the development of ventricular fibrillation) can occur in MIs."}
