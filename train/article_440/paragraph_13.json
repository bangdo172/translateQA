Inflammation is known to be an important step in the process of atherosclerotic plaque formation. C-reactive protein (<b2_0>CRP<b2_0/>) is a sensitive but nonspecific marker for inflammation. Elevated CRP blood levels, especially measured with high-sensitivity assays, can predict the risk of MI, as well as stroke and development of diabetes. Moreover, some drugs for MI might also reduce <b3_0>CRP levels<b3_0/>. The use of <b4_0>high-sensitivity CRP assays<b4_0/> as a means of screening the general population is advised against, but it may be used optionally at the physician's discretion in those who already present with other risk factors or known coronary artery disease. Whether CRP plays a direct role in <b1_0>atherosclerosis<b1_0/> remains uncertain."}
