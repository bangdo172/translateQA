Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others. The mechanism of an MI often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by <b2_0>a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque<b2_0/>. MIs are less commonly caused by <b3_0>coronary artery spasms<b3_0/>, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others. A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (<b0_0>ECGs<b0_0/>), blood tests, and coronary angiography. An ECG may confirm an <b4_0>ST elevation<b4_0/> MI if ST elevation is present. Commonly used <b1_0>blood tests<b1_0/> include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB."}
