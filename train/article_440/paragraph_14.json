This must be greater than 2 mm (<b2_0>0.2 mV<b2_0/>) for males and greater than 1.5 mm (0.15 mV) in females if in leads <b4_0>V2 and V3<b4_0/> or greater than 1 mm (0.1 mV) if it is in other ECG leads. <b3_0>A left bundle branch block<b3_0/> that is believed to be new used to be considered the same as ST elevation; however, this is no longer the case.
