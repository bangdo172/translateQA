Women also report more numerous symptoms compared with men (<b0_0>2.6<b0_0/> on average vs. 1.8 symptoms in men). The most common symptoms of MI in women include <b1_0>dyspnea, weakness, and fatigue<b1_0/>. Fatigue, sleep disturbances, and dyspnea have been reported as frequently occurring symptoms that may manifest as long as <b2_0>one month<b2_0/> before the actual clinically manifested ischemic event.
