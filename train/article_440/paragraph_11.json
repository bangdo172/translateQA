A collagen scar forms in their place. Recent studies indicate that another form of cell death, apoptosis, also plays a role in the process of tissue damage following an MI. As a result, the person's heart will be permanently damaged. This myocardial scarring also puts the person at risk for potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms (<b2_0>arrhythmias<b2_0/>), and may result in the formation of a ventricular aneurysm that can rupture with catastrophic consequences."}
