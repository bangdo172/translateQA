Chest pain is the most common symptom of acute MI and is often described as <b1_0>a sensation of tightness, pressure, or squeezing<b1_0/>. Chest pain due to ischemia (<b4_0>a lack of blood<b4_0/> and hence oxygen supply) of the heart muscle is termed <b3_0>angina pectoris<b3_0/>. Pain radiates most often to the left arm, but may also radiate to the lower jaw, neck, right arm, back, and upper abdomen, where it may mimic heartburn. <b2_0>Levine's sign<b2_0/>, in which a person localizes the chest pain by clenching their fists over their sternum, has classically been thought to be predictive of cardiac chest pain, although a prospective observational study showed it had a poor positive predictive value."}
