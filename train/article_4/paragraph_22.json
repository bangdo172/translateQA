He originally envisioned a full <a1_0><b8_0>50<b8_0/><a1_0/>-person orchestra for action sequences and a string quartet for more \"lyrical moments\", though the final product used sequenced music instead. Kondo later cited the lack of interactivity that comes with orchestral music as one of the main reasons for the decision.
