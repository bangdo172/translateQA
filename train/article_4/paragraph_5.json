The Wii version of the game makes use of the <a5_0>motion<a5_0/> sensors and built-in speaker of the <a0_0><a2_0><a6_0><b9_0>Wii Remote<b9_0/><a6_0/><a2_0/><a0_0/>. The speaker emits the sounds of a bowstring when shooting an arrow, Midna's laugh when she gives advice to Link, and the series' trademark \"<a1_0><b8_0>chime<b8_0/><a1_0/>\" when discovering secrets. The player controls Link's sword by swinging the <b7_0>Wii Remote<b7_0/>. Other attacks are triggered using similar gestures with the <a3_0><b10_0>Nunchuk<b10_0/><a3_0/>. Unique to the GameCube version is the ability for the player to control the camera freely, without entering a special \"lookaround\" mode required by the Wii; however, in the GameCube version, only <a4_0><b11_0>two<b11_0/><a4_0/> of Link's secondary weapons can be equipped at a time, as opposed to four in the Wii version.[g]"}
