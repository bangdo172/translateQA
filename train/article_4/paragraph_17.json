His team began work developing a <a0_0><b4_0>pointing-based<b4_0/><a0_0/> interface for the bow and arrow, and <b8_0>Aonuma<b8_0/> found that aiming directly at the screen gave the game a new feel, just like the DS control scheme for Phantom Hourglass. Aonuma felt confident this was the only way to proceed, but worried about consumers who had been anticipating a GameCube release. Developing two versions would mean delaying the previously announced <a1_0><a3_0><b5_0><b7_0>2005<b7_0/><b5_0/><a3_0/><a1_0/> release, still disappointing the consumer. <a2_0><b6_0>Satoru Iwata<b6_0/><a2_0/> felt that having both versions would satisfy users in the end, even though they would have to wait for the finished product. Aonuma then started working on both versions in parallel.[o]"}
