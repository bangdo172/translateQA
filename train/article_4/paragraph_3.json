It uses the basic control scheme introduced in <a1_0><a6_0><b10_0>Ocarina of Time<b10_0/><a6_0/><a1_0/>, including context-sensitive action buttons and <a2_0><a8_0>L-targeting<a8_0/><a2_0/> (Z-targeting on the Wii), a system that allows the player to keep Link's view focused on an enemy or important object while moving and attacking. Link can walk, run, and attack, and will automatically jump when running off of or reaching for a ledge.[c] Link uses a <a3_0><a7_0><b11_0>sword<b11_0/><a3_0/> and shield<a7_0/> in combat, complemented with secondary weapons and items, including a bow and arrows, a boomerang, bombs, and the <a4_0><b12_0>Clawshot<b12_0/><a4_0/> (similar to the Hookshot introduced earlier in the The Legend of Zelda series).[d] While L-targeting, projectile-based weapons can be fired at a target without the need for manual aiming.[c]"}
