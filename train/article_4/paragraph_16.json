In A Link to the Past, Link travels between a \"Light World\" and a \"Dark World\"; in Ocarina of Time, as well as in Oracle of Ages, Link travels between two different time periods. The Zelda team sought to reuse this motif in the series' latest installment. It was suggested that Link transform into a wolf, much like he metamorphoses into a <a0_0><b6_0>rabbit<b6_0/><a0_0/> in the Dark World of A Link to the Past.[m] The story of the game was created by Aonuma, and later underwent several changes by scenario writers <a4_0><b10_0>Mitsuhiro Takano<b10_0/><a4_0/> and Aya Kyogoku. Takano created the script for the story scenes, while Kyogoku and Takayuki Ikkaku handled the actual in-game script. Aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he directed <a1_0><b7_0>The Minish Cap<b7_0/><a1_0/> for the Game Boy Advance. When he returned, he found the Twilight Princess team struggling. Emphasis on the parallel worlds and the wolf transformation had made Link's character unbelievable. Aonuma also felt the gameplay lacked the caliber of innovation found in Phantom Hourglass, which was being developed with touch controls for the Nintendo DS. At the same time, the Wii was under development with the code name \"<a2_0><b8_0>Revolution<b8_0/><a2_0/>\". <a3_0><b9_0>Miyamoto<b9_0/><a3_0/> thought that the Revolution's pointing device, the <a5_0>Wii Remote<a5_0/>, was well suited for aiming arrows in Zelda, and suggested that Aonuma consider using it.[n]"}
