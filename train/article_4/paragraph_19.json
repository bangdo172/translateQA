A prototype was created that used a <a0_0><b7_0>swinging gesture<b7_0/><a0_0/> to control the sword from a first-person viewpoint, but was unable to show the variety of Link's movements. When the third-person view was restored, Aonuma thought it felt strange to swing the Wii Remote with the right hand to control the sword in Link's left hand, so the entire Wii version map was mirrored.[p] Details about Wii controls began to surface in December 2005 when British publication <a1_0><a5_0><b8_0>NGC Magazine<b8_0/><a5_0/><a1_0/> claimed that when a GameCube copy of Twilight Princess was played on the Revolution, it would give the player the option of using the Revolution controller. Miyamoto confirmed the Revolution controller-functionality in an interview with Nintendo of Europe and Time reported this soon after. However, support for the <a2_0><b9_0>Wii controller<b9_0/><a2_0/> did not make it into the GameCube release. At <a6_0>E3 <a3_0><b10_0>2006<b10_0/><a6_0/><a3_0/>, Nintendo announced that both versions would be available at the Wii launch, and had a playable version of Twilight Princess for the Wii.[p] Later, the GameCube release was pushed back to <a4_0><b11_0>a month<b11_0/><a4_0/> after the launch of the Wii."}
