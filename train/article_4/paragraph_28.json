Game Informer called it \"so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer\". GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as \"a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation\". Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as \"the single greatest videogame experience\". Twilight Princess's graphics were praised for the art style and animation, although the game was designed for the GameCube, which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles. Both <a0_0><a5_0><b8_0>IGN and GameSpy<b8_0/><a5_0/><a0_0/> pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters. Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created. PALGN praised the game's cinematics, noting that \"the cutscenes are the best ever in Zelda games\". Regarding the Wii version, <a2_0><b10_0>GameSpot<b10_0/><a2_0/>'s <a1_0>Jeff Gerstmann<a1_0/> said the Wii controls felt \"tacked-on\", although 1UP.com said the remote-swinging sword attacks were \"the most impressive in the entire series\". <a6_0>Gaming Nexus<a6_0/> considered Twilight Princess's soundtrack to be the best of this generation, though IGN criticized its MIDI-formatted songs for lacking \"the punch and crispness\" of their orchestrated counterparts. <a4_0><b12_0>Hyper<b12_0/><a4_0/>'s <a3_0><a7_0><b9_0><b11_0>Javier Glickman<b11_0/><b9_0/><a7_0/><a3_0/> commended the game for its \"very long quests, superb Wii controls and being able to save anytime\". However, he criticised it for \"no voice acting, no orchestral score and slightly outdated graphics\"."}
