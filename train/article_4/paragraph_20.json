Aonuma realized that his team had implemented Wii controls under the mindset of \"forcing\" users to adapt, instead of making the system intuitive and easy to use. He began rethinking the controls with Miyamoto to focus on <a4_0><b9_0>comfort and ease<b9_0/><a4_0/>.[q] The camera movement was reworked and item controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses.[r] In addition, the new item system required use of the button that had previously been used for the <a1_0><b7_0>sword<b7_0/><a1_0/>. To solve this, sword controls were transferred back to gestures\u2014something <a2_0>E3 attendees<a2_0/> had commented they would like to see. This reintroduced the problem of using a <a3_0><b8_0>right<b8_0/><a3_0/>-handed swing to control a left-handed <b6_0>sword<b6_0/> attack. The team did not have enough time before release to rework Link's character model, so they instead flipped the entire game\u2014everything was made a mirror image.[s] Link was now right-handed, and references to \"east\" and \"west\" were switched around. The GameCube version, however, was left with the original orientation. The Twilight Princess player's guide focuses on the Wii version, but has a section in the back with mirror-image maps for GameCube users.[t]"}
