Women's evening dress included obligatory trains and <a6_0><b10_0>tiaras or feathers<b10_0/><a6_0/> in their hair (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed.

Following their accession in <a3_0>1936<a3_0/>, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, <a0_0><a9_0>there is no official dress code<a9_0/><a0_0/>. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie."}
