This new, refaced principal fa\u00e7ade (of <a1_0><a6_0>Portland stone<a6_0/><a1_0/>) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. <a2_0><a7_0><b11_0>George V<b11_0/><a7_0/><a2_0/>, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) \u2013 the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife <a3_0>Queen Mary<a3_0/> was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the <a8_0>Royal Collection of furniture and art<a8_0/>, both restoring and adding to it. <b12_0><b14_0>Queen Mary<b14_0/><b12_0/> also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden fa\u00e7ade. <a4_0><a9_0>Queen Mary<a9_0/><a4_0/> was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets."}
