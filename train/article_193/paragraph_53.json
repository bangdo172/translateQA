Double parking is common (with franeleros moving the cars as required), impeding on the available lanes for traffic to pass. In order to mitigate that and other problems and to raise revenue, <a4_0>721<a4_0/> parking meters (as of October 2013), have been installed in the west-central neighborhoods Lomas de Chapultepec, Condesa, Roma, Polanco and Anzures, in operation from <a3_0>8 AM to 8 PM<a3_0/> on weekdays and charging a rate of 2 pesos per 15 minutes, with offenders' cars booted, costing about 500 pesos to remove. 30 percent of the monthly <a2_0>16 million-peso<a2_0/> (as of October 2013) income from the parking-meter system (named \"<a0_0>ecoParq<a0_0/>\") is earmarked for neighborhood improvements. The granting of the license for all zones exclusively to a new company without experience in operating parking meters, <a1_0>Operadora de Estacionamientos Bicentenario<a1_0/>, has generated controversy."}
