Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the <a1_0>Museo Nacional de San Carlos<a1_0/> (National Museum of San Carlos). One of the students, <a2_0>Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco<a2_0/>, is considered one of the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century. Porfirio D\u00edaz's regime sponsored arts, especially those that followed the French school. Popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished, e.g. those of Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada and Manuel Manilla. The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as <a3_0>Rembrandt, Vel\u00e1zquez, Murillo, and Rubens<a3_0/>."}
