They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a <a0_0>catalytic converter<a0_0/>, which reduces the emissions released. Trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Also construction of an underground rail system was begun in <a1_0>1968<a1_0/> in order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate traffic congestion. Today it has over 201 km (125 mi) of track and carries over <a2_0>5 million people<a2_0/> every day. Fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during rush hours the crush is so great, that authorities have <a4_0>reserved a special carriage specifically for women<a4_0/>. Due to these initiatives and others, the air quality in Mexico City has begun to improve, with the air becoming cleaner since 1991, when the air quality was declared to be a public health risk for <a3_0>355<a3_0/> days of the year.[citation needed]"}
