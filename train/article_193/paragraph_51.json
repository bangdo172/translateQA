The eje vial network is based on a quasi-Cartesian grid, with the ejes themselves being called Eje 1 Poniente, Eje Central, and Eje 1 Oriente, for example, for the north-south roads, and Eje 2 Sur and Eje 3 Norte, for example, for east-west roads. Ring roads are the Circuito Interior (inner ring), Anillo Perif\u00e9rico; the Circuito Exterior Mexiquense (\"State of Mexico outer loop\") toll road skirting the northeastern and eastern edges of the metropolitan area, the Chamapa-La Venta toll road skirting the northwestern edge, and the Arco Norte completely bypassing the metropolitan area in an arc from northwest (Atlacomulco) to north (Tula, Hidalgo) to east (Puebla). A second level (where <a1_0>tolls are charged<a1_0/>) of the Perif\u00e9rico, colloquially called the segundo piso (\"second floor\"), was officially opened in <a2_0>2012<a2_0/>, with sections still being completed. <a3_0>The Viaducto Miguel Alem\u00e1n<a3_0/> crosses the city east-west from Observatorio to the airport. In 2013 <a4_0>the Superv\u00eda Poniente<a4_0/> opened, a toll road linking the new Santa Fe business district with southwestern Mexico City."}
