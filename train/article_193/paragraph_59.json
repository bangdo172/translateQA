The Metropolitan Cathedral still displays works by <a2_0>Juan de Rojas<a2_0/>, Juan Correa and an oil painting whose authorship has been attributed to Murillo. Secular works of art of this period include the <a3_0>equestrian sculpture of Charles IV of Spain<a3_0/>, locally known as El Caballito (\"The little horse\"). This piece, in bronze, was the work of <a4_0>Manuel Tols\u00e1<a4_0/> and it has been placed at the Plaza Tols\u00e1, in front of the Palacio de Miner\u00eda (Mining Palace). Directly in front of this building is the beautiful Museo Nacional de Arte (Munal) (the National Museum of Art)."}
