One of Spielberg's trademarks is his use of music by Williams to add to the visual impact of his scenes and to try and create a lasting picture and sound of the film in the memories of the film audience. These visual scenes often uses images of the sun (e.g. Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, the final scene of Jurassic Park, and the end credits of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (where <a1_0>they ride into the sunset<a1_0/>)), of which the last two feature a Williams score at that end scene. Spielberg is a contemporary of filmmakers <a2_0>George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, John Milius, and Brian De Palma<a2_0/>, collectively known as the \"Movie Brats\". Aside from his principal role as a director, Spielberg has acted as a producer for a considerable number of films, including early hits for Joe Dante and Robert Zemeckis.
