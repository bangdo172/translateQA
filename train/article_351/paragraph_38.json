For cinematography, <a1_0>Allen Daviau<a1_0/>, a childhood friend and cinematographer, shot the early Spielberg film <a3_0><b6_0>Amblin<b6_0/><a3_0/> and most of his films up to Empire of the Sun; Janusz Kami\u0144ski who has shot every Spielberg film since <a2_0><b7_0><b9_0>Schindler's List<b9_0/><b7_0/><a2_0/> (see List of film director and cinematographer collaborations); and the film editor Michael Kahn who has edited every film directed by Spielberg from <a4_0><b8_0>Close Encounters<b8_0/><a4_0/> to Munich (except E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial). Most of the DVDs of Spielberg's films have documentaries by Laurent Bouzereau."}
