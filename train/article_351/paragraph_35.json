Artificial Intelligence and The BFG<a0_0/>. According to <b6_0><b7_0><b8_0><b9_0>Warren Buckland<b9_0/><b8_0/><b7_0/><b6_0/>, these themes are portrayed through the use of <a1_0>low height camera tracking shots<a1_0/>, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (<a2_0>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Empire of the Sun, Jurassic Park<a2_0/>, etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like Munich, Saving Private Ryan, The Terminal, Minority Report, and Amistad. If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in Jaws are filmed <a3_0>from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming<a3_0/>. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In Empire of the Sun, Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II <b5_0>China<b5_0/>. Similarly, in Catch Me If You Can, <a4_0>Frank<a4_0/> naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them."}
