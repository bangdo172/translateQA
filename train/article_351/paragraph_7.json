The first was a Richard Matheson adaptation called Duel. The film is about <b13_0>a psychotic <a6_0>Peterbilt 281 tanker<a6_0/> truck driver<b13_0/> who chases the terrified driver (<b10_0><b12_0>Dennis Weaver<b12_0/><b10_0/>) of a small Plymouth Valiant and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic <a1_0><a7_0><b14_0>Dilys Powell<b14_0/><a7_0/><a1_0/> was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (<a8_0>Something Evil<a8_0/>) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of The Exorcist, then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called Savage, starring <a2_0><a9_0><b11_0>Martin Landau<b11_0/><a9_0/><a2_0/>. Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was The Sugarland Express, about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain <a4_0>custody of their baby<a4_0/>. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and The Hollywood Reporter stated that \"a major new director is on the horizon.\":223 However, the film fared <a3_0>poorly<a3_0/> at the box office and received a limited release."}
