Miller<a0_0/> (Tom Hanks) sent to bring home a paratrooper whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours, June 5\u20136, of the Normandy landing. The film was a huge box office success, grossing <a2_0>over <b6_0><b7_0>$481 million<b7_0/><b6_0/> worldwide<a2_0/> and was the biggest film of the year at the North American box office (worldwide it made second place after <a4_0><b9_0>Michael Bay<b9_0/><a4_0/>'s <a3_0>Armageddon<a3_0/>). Spielberg won his second Academy Award for his direction. The film's graphic, realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as Black Hawk Down and Enemy at the Gates. The film was also the first major hit for DreamWorks, which co-produced the film with <b8_0>Paramount Pictures<b8_0/> (as such, it was Spielberg's first release from the latter that was not part of the Indiana Jones series). Later, Spielberg and Tom Hanks produced a TV mini-series based on Stephen Ambrose's book Band of Brothers. The ten-part HBO mini-series follows Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division's 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The series won a number of awards at the Golden Globes and the Emmys."}
