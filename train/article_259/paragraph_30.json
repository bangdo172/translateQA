These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is <b5_0>of <a1_0>central importance<b5_0/><a1_0/>, and <a2_0>Jesus willingly sacrificed himself<a2_0/> as <a3_0>an act of <b6_0>perfect obedience<b6_0/><a3_0/> as a sacrifice of love which <b7_0>pleased<b7_0/> God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the <b8_0>Middle Ages<b8_0/> there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of <b9_0>penal substitution<b9_0/>. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement. Both views are popular within <a4_0>the Roman Catholic church<a4_0/>, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance."}
