The text does not indicate why it was so designated, but several theories have been put forward. One is that as <a2_0>a place of <b6_0>public<b6_0/> <b9_0>execution<b9_0/><a2_0/>, Calvary may have been strewn with the <a3_0>skulls of <b7_0>abandoned<b7_0/> victims<a3_0/> (which would be contrary to Jewish burial traditions, but not Roman). Another is that Calvary is named after a nearby cemetery (which is consistent with both of the proposed modern sites). A third is that <a4_0>the name was derived from the physical contour<a4_0/>, which would be more consistent with the singular use of the word, i.e., the place of \"a skull\". While often referred to as \"Mount Calvary\", it was more likely <b8_0>a small hill<b8_0/> or rocky knoll."}
