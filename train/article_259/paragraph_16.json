For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb.\" Irenaeus, who died around the end of the 2nd century, speaks of the cross as having \"<a3_0>five extremities<a3_0/>, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is <a4_0>fixed by the <b8_0>nails<b8_0/><a4_0/>.\""}
