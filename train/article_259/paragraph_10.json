Some scholars explain a Thursday crucifixion <b7_0>based on <a1_0>a \"double sabbath\"<b7_0/> caused by an extra Passover sabbath<a1_0/> falling on Thursday dusk to Friday afternoon, ahead of the normal weekly Sabbath. Some have argued that Jesus was crucified on <b8_0>Wednesday<b8_0/>, not Friday, <a2_0>on the grounds of the mention of \"<a3_0>three days and three nights<a3_0/>\" in Matthew<a2_0/> before his resurrection, celebrated on Sunday. Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a \"day and night\" may refer to any part of <b9_0>a 24-hour period<b9_0/>, that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic, not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb, and that the many <a4_0>references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights<a4_0/>."}
