The Gospel of Luke's unique contributions to the narrative include Jesus' <a2_0>words to <b6_0>the women<b6_0/> who were mourning<a2_0/>, one criminal's <b7_0>rebuke<b7_0/> of the other, the reaction of the multitudes who left <b8_0>\"beating their breasts\"<b8_0/>, and the women preparing <b9_0>spices and ointments<b9_0/> before resting on the Sabbath. <a3_0>John<a3_0/> is also the only one to refer to the request that the legs be broken and the soldier's subsequent piercing of Jesus' side (as fulfillment of <a4_0>Old Testament prophecy<a4_0/>), as well as that Nicodemus assisted Joseph with burial."}
