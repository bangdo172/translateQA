Matthew's and Mark's Gospels record that he <b5_0>refused<b5_0/> this. He was then crucified and hung between two convicted thieves. According to some translations from the original Greek, the thieves may have been bandits or Jewish rebels. According to Mark's Gospel, he endured the torment of crucifixion for some <a1_0>six hours<a1_0/> from the third hour, at approximately 9 am, until his death at the ninth hour, corresponding to about 3 pm. The soldiers affixed a sign above his head stating \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews\" in three languages, divided his garments and cast lots for his seamless robe. The Roman soldiers did not break Jesus' legs, as they did to the other two men crucified (breaking the legs hastened the crucifixion process), as Jesus was dead already. Each gospel has its own account of Jesus' last words, <a2_0><b6_0>seven<b6_0/> statements altogether<a2_0/>. In the Synoptic Gospels, various supernatural events accompany the crucifixion, including darkness, an earthquake, and (in Matthew) the resurrection of saints. Following Jesus' death, his body was removed from the cross by <a3_0>Joseph of Arimathea<a3_0/> and buried <b7_0>in a rock-hewn tomb<b7_0/>, with <b8_0>Nicodemus<b8_0/> assisting."}
