Compared to the accounts in the other Gospels, which he describes as '<a3_0>theologically correct and reassuring<a3_0/>', he considers this phrase '<b8_0>unexpected, disquieting<b8_0/> and in consequence more probable'. He describes it as bearing 'all the appearances of <a4_0>a genuine cry<a4_0/>'.
