These variations are also present in the <a2_0>artistic depictions of the crucifixion<a2_0/>. In the Western Church, before <b8_0>the Renaissance<b8_0/> usually four nails would be depicted, with the feet <b6_0>side by side<b6_0/>. After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails, with one foot placed on the other. <a3_0>Nails are almost always depicted<a3_0/> in <b7_0><b9_0>art<b9_0/><b7_0/>, although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross.
