Wales followed suit in <a1_0>April 2007<a1_0/>, with England introducing the ban in <a2_0>July 2007<a2_0/>. Pub landlords had raised concerns prior to the implementation of the law that a smoking ban would have a negative impact on sales. After two years, the impact of the ban was mixed; some pubs suffered declining sales, while others developed their food sales. The <a4_0>Wetherspoon<a4_0/> pub chain reported in June 2009 that profits were at the top end of expectations; however, Scottish & Newcastle's takeover by <a3_0>Carlsberg and Heineken<a3_0/> was reported in January 2008 as partly the result of its weakness following falling sales due to the ban. Similar bans are applied in Australian pubs with smoking only allowed in designated areas."}
