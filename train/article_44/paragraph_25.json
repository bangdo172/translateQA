During the 20th century elsewhere, both the licensing laws and enforcement were progressively relaxed, and there were differences between parishes; in the 1960s, at closing time in Kensington at <a0_0>10:30 pm<a0_0/>, drinkers would rush over the parish boundary to be in good time for \"Last Orders\" in Knightsbridge before <a1_0>11 pm<a1_0/>, a practice observed in many pubs adjoining licensing area boundaries. Some Scottish and Welsh parishes remained officially \"dry\" on <a4_0>Sundays<a4_0/> (although often this merely required knocking at the back door of the pub). These restricted opening hours led to the tradition of lock-ins."}
