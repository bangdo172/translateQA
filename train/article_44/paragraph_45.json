Most such breweries, such as the regional brewery <a0_0>Shepherd Neame<a0_0/> in Kent and <a1_0>Young's and Fuller's<a1_0/> in London, control hundreds of pubs in a particular region of the UK, while a few, such as <a2_0>Greene King<a2_0/>, are spread nationally. The landlord of a tied pub may be an employee of the brewery\u2014in which case he/she would be a manager of a managed house, or a self-employed tenant who has entered into a lease agreement with a brewery, a condition of which is the legal obligation (trade tie) only to purchase that brewery's beer. The beer selection is mainly limited to beers brewed by that particular company. <a3_0>The Beer Orders<a3_0/>, passed in <a4_0>1989<a4_0/>, were aimed at getting tied houses to offer at least one alternative beer, known as a guest beer, from another brewery. This law has now been repealed but while in force it dramatically altered the industry. Some pubs still offer a regularly changing selection of guest beers."}
