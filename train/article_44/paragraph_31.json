More common, however, was a card room or a billiard room.[citation needed] The saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a higher price of drinks, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed and drinks would be served at the table.[citation needed] From this came the popular music hall form of entertainment\u2014a show consisting of a variety of acts.[citation needed] A most famous London saloon was the Grecian Saloon in <a2_0>The Eagle<a2_0/>, <a1_0>City Road<a1_0/>, which is still famous because of a nursery rhyme: \"Up and down the City Road / In and out The Eagle / That's the way the money goes / Pop goes the <a3_0>weasel<a3_0/>.\" This meant that the customer had spent all his money at The Eagle, and needed to pawn his \"weasel\" to get some more. The meaning of the \"weasel\" is unclear but the two most likely definitions are: a flat iron used for finishing clothing; or rhyming slang for a coat (weasel and stoat)."}
