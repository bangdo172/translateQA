The latter tend to provide alcohol (and, in <a1_0>the UK<a1_0/>, soft drinks and often food), but less commonly accommodation. Inns tend to be older and grander establishments: historically they provided not only food and lodging, but also stabling and fodder for the traveller's horse(s) and on some roads fresh <a4_0>horses<a4_0/> for the mail coach. Famous London inns include <a2_0>The George<a2_0/>, Southwark and The Tabard. There is however no longer a formal distinction between an inn and other kinds of establishment. Many pubs use \"Inn\" in their name, either because they are long established former coaching inns, or to summon up a particular kind of image, or in many cases simply as a pun on the word \"in\", as in \"The Welcome Inn\", the name of many pubs in <a3_0>Scotland<a3_0/>."}
