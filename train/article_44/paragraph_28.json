It was argued that this would end the concentration of violence around <a2_0>11.30 pm<a2_0/>, when people had to leave the pub, making policing easier. In practice, alcohol-related hospital admissions rose following the change in the law, with alcohol involved in <a3_0>207,800<a3_0/> admissions in 2006/7. Critics claimed that these laws would lead to \"24-hour drinking\". By the time the law came into effect, 60,326 establishments had applied for longer hours and <a4_0>1,121<a4_0/> had applied for a licence to sell alcohol 24 hours a day. However nine months later many pubs had not changed their hours, although some stayed open longer at the weekend, but rarely beyond 1:00 am."}
