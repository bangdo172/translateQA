The permission for the ordination of women given in 1974 was rescinded in <a1_0>1991<a1_0/> without affecting the two or three existing woman ministers.

The theology of the church is now generally conservative and Reformed. A number of small Presbyterian denominations have arisen since the 1950s through migration or schism."}
