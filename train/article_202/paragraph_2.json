As the Catholic Church resisted the reformers, several different theological movements splintered from the Church and bore different denominations. Presbyterianism was especially influenced by the French theologian <a1_0><b7_0>John Calvin<b7_0/><a1_0/>, who is credited with the development of Reformed theology, and the work of John Knox, a Scotsman who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland and brought his teachings back to Scotland. The Presbyterian church traces its ancestry back primarily to <b6_0>England and Scotland<b6_0/>. In August <a2_0><b8_0>1560<b8_0/><a2_0/> the Parliament of Scotland adopted the Scots Confession as the creed of the Scottish Kingdom. In December 1560, the <a3_0>First Book of Discipline<a3_0/> was published, outlining important doctrinal issues but also establishing regulations for church government, including the creation of ten ecclesiastical districts with appointed superintendents which later became known as presbyteries."}
