However, there is not one fixed \"Presbyterian\" worship style. Although there are set services for the \"Lord's Day\", one can find a service to be evangelical and even revivalist in tone (especially in some conservative denominations), or strongly liturgical, approximating the practices of Lutheranism or Anglicanism (especially where Scottish tradition is esteemed),[clarification needed] or semi-formal, allowing for a balance of <a1_0>hymns, preaching, and congregational participation<a1_0/> (favored by probably most American Presbyterians). Most Presbyterian churches follow the traditional liturgical year and observe the <b4_0>traditional holidays<b4_0/>, holy seasons, such as <b7_0>Advent, Christmas, Ash Wednesday, Holy Week, Easter, Pentecost, etc.<b7_0/> They also make use of the appropriate seasonal liturgical colors, etc. Many, incorporate <b5_0>ancient liturgical prayers and responses<b5_0/> into the communion services and follow a <b6_0>daily, seasonal, and festival<b6_0/> lectionary. Other Presbyterians, however, such as the Reformed Presbyterians, would practice a <a2_0>cappella exclusive psalmody<a2_0/>, as well as eschew the celebration of holy days."}
