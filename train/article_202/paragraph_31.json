The Presbyterian schism began with the controversy in relation to the Japanese shrine worship enforced during the Japanese colonial period and the establishment of a minor division (Koryu-pa, \uace0\ub824\ud30c, later The Koshin Presbyterian Church in Korea, Koshin \uace0\uc2e0) in 1952.

The last major schism had to do with the issue of <a2_0>whether the PCK should join the WCC<a2_0/>. The controversy divided the PCK into two denominations, The Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap, \ud1b5\ud569) and The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong, \ud569\ub3d9) in <b8_0>1959<b8_0/>. All major seminaries associated with each denomination claim heritage from the <b9_0>Pyung Yang Theological Seminary<b9_0/>, therefore, not only Presbyterian University and Theological Seminary and Chongsin University which are related to PCK but also Hanshin University of PROK all celebrated the 100th class in <a4_0>2007<a4_0/>, 100 years from the first graduates of Pyung Yang Theological Seminary."}
