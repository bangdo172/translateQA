Constantine called all the Christian bishops throughout the Roman Empire to a meeting, and some <a1_0>318<a1_0/> bishops (very few from the <a2_0>Western Empire<a2_0/>) attended the <a0_0>First Council of Nicaea<a0_0/>. The purpose of this meeting was to define <a3_0>Christian orthodoxy<a3_0/> and clearly differentiate it from Christian heresies. The meeting reached consensus on the <a4_0>Nicene Creed<a4_0/> and other statements. Later, Philostorgius criticized Christians who offered sacrifice at statues of the divus Constantine. Constantine nevertheless took great pains to assuage traditionalist and Christian anxieties."}
