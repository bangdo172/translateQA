The majority of Rome\u2019s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework. Christians saw these <a4_0>ungodly practices<a4_0/> as a primary cause of economic and political crisis."}
