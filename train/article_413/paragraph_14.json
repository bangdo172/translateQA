During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in <a2_0>public display<a2_0/>, and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under <a3_0>Imperial<a3_0/> control: the most lavish were subsidised by <a4_0>emperors<a4_0/>, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era (saeculum), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part."}
