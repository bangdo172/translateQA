During the <a2_0>Punic crisis<a2_0/>, popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy; <a1_0>Dionysus<a1_0/> was equated with Father Liber, the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms, and with Roman <a3_0>Bacchus<a3_0/>. Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of Marsyas, the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo, became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus' censorship. Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo; but his settlement appealed to all classes. Where loyalty was implicit, no <a4_0>divine hierarchy<a4_0/> need be politically enforced; Liber's festival continued."}
