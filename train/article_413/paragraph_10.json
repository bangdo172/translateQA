Some evidently favoured Rome because <a2_0>Rome honoured them<a2_0/>, but none were intrinsically, irredeemably foreign or alien. The political, cultural and religious coherence of an emergent Roman super-state required a broad, inclusive and flexible network of <a3_0>lawful<a3_0/> cults. At different times and in different places, the sphere of influence, character and functions of a divine being could expand, overlap with those of others, and be redefined as Roman. <a4_0>Change<a4_0/> was embedded within existing traditions."}
