Di superi with strong connections to the earth, such as Mars, Janus, Neptune and various genii \u2013 including the Emperor's \u2013 were offered <a2_0>fertile<a2_0/> victims. After the sacrifice, a <a3_0>banquet<a3_0/> was held; in state cults, the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion (exta, the innards).
