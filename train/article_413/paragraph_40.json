The major prodigies included the spontaneous combustion of weapons, the apparent shrinking of the sun's disc, two moons in a daylit sky, a cosmic battle between sun and moon, a rain of red-hot stones, a bloody sweat on statues, and blood in fountains and on ears of corn: all were expiated by sacrifice of \"<a1_0>greater victims<a1_0/>\". The minor prodigies were less warlike but equally unnatural; sheep become goats, a hen become a cock (and vice versa) \u2013 these were expiated with \"<a2_0>lesser victims<a2_0/>\". The discovery of an androgynous four-year-old child was expiated by its drowning and the holy procession of 27 virgins to the temple of Juno Regina, singing a hymn to avert disaster: a lightning strike during the hymn rehearsals required further expiation. Religious restitution is proved only by <a3_0>Rome's victory<a3_0/>."}
