Even the most skeptical among Rome's intellectual elite such as Cicero, who was an augur, saw religion as a source of <a1_0>social order<a1_0/>. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a <a2_0>household shrine<a2_0/> at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around <a3_0>religious observances<a3_0/>. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported <a4_0>Vestals<a4_0/>, who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination."}
