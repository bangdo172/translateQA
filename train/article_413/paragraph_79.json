He proposed the rebuilding of <a3_0>Jerusalem's temple<a3_0/> as an Imperial project and argued against the \"irrational impieties\" of Christian doctrine. His attempt to restore an Augustan form of principate, with himself as primus inter pares ended with his death in 363 in Persia, after which his reforms were reversed or abandoned. The empire once again fell under <a4_0>Christian control<a4_0/>, this time permanently."}
