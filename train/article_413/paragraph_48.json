Some rituals specifically required the presence of women, but their active participation was <a0_0>limited<a0_0/>. As a rule women did not perform <a1_0>animal sacrifice<a1_0/>, the central rite of most major public ceremonies. In addition to the public priesthood of the <a2_0>Vestals<a2_0/>, some cult practices were reserved for women only. The rites of the <a3_0>Bona Dea<a3_0/> excluded men entirely. Because women enter the public record less frequently than men, their religious practices are less known, and even family cults were headed by the paterfamilias. A host of deities, however, are associated with <a4_0>motherhood<a4_0/>. Juno, Diana, Lucina, and specialized divine attendants presided over the life-threatening act of giving birth and the perils of caring for a baby at a time when the infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent."}
