Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors, and offered similar cult to Caesar's successor, <a2_0>Augustus<a2_0/>, who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship; it might prove fatal. By the end of his reign, Augustus had appropriated Rome's political apparatus \u2013 and most of its religious cults \u2013 within his \"reformed\" and thoroughly <a3_0>integrated<a3_0/> system of government. Towards the end of his life, he cautiously allowed cult to his numen. By then the <a4_0>Imperial cult<a4_0/> apparatus was fully developed, first in the Eastern Provinces, then in the West. Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context; bathhouses, shrines and temples to Roman and local deities, amphitheatres and festivals. In the early Imperial period, the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship."}
