The customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued; St Augustine (following St Ambrose) feared that this invited the \"drunken\" practices of Parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a Christian opportunity to give <a2_0>alms of food<a2_0/> to the poor. Christians attended Parentalia and its accompanying Feralia and Caristia in sufficient numbers for the Council of Tours to forbid them in <a3_0>AD 567<a3_0/>. Other funerary and commemorative practices were very different. Traditional Roman practice spurned the corpse as a <a4_0>ritual pollution<a4_0/>; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life. The Christian Church fostered the veneration of saintly relics, and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to \"new life\"."}
