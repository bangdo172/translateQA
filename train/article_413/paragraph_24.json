The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice, probably because <a2_0>death<a2_0/> was not its inevitable outcome or purpose. Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods, and the combat was dedicated <a3_0>as an offering<a3_0/> to the di manes or other gods.
