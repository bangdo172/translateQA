In Cicero's time, the better-off sacrificed a <a1_0>sow<a1_0/> at the funeral pyre before cremation. The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre, Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar, and the family at the site of the cremation. For the <a2_0>less well-off<a2_0/>, inhumation with \"a libation of wine, incense, and fruit or crops was sufficient\". <a4_0>Ceres<a4_0/> functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead: the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living. The ashes (or body) were entombed or buried. On the eighth day of mourning, the family offered further sacrifice, this time on the ground; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld. They had become one of the di Manes, who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the <a3_0>Parentalia<a3_0/>, a multi-day festival of remembrance in February."}
