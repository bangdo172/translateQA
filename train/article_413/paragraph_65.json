Those who acknowledged Rome's hegemony retained their own cult and religious calendars, independent of <a0_0>Roman religious law<a0_0/>. Newly municipal Sabratha built a Capitolium near its existing temple to Liber Pater and Serapis. <a2_0>Autonomy and concord<a2_0/> were official policy, but new foundations by Roman citizens or their Romanised allies were likely to follow Roman cultic models. Romanisation offered distinct political and practical advantages, especially to local elites. All the known effigies from the 2nd century AD forum at Cuicul are of emperors or Concordia. By the middle of the 1st century AD, Gaulish Vertault seems to have abandoned its native cultic sacrifice of horses and dogs in favour of a newly established, <a3_0>Romanised<a3_0/> cult nearby: by the end of that century, Sabratha\u2019s so-called tophet was no longer in use. Colonial and later Imperial provincial dedications to Rome's Capitoline Triad were a logical choice, not a <a4_0>centralised legal requirement<a4_0/>. Major cult centres to \"non-Roman\" deities continued to prosper: notable examples include the magnificent Alexandrian Serapium, the temple of Aesculapeus at Pergamum and Apollo's sacred wood at Antioch."}
