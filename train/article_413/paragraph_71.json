Decius' edict appealed to whatever common mos maiores might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults; no ancestral gods were specified by name. The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman. Roman oaths of loyalty were traditionally collective; the <a2_0>Decian oath<a2_0/> has been interpreted as a design to root out individual <a3_0>subversives<a3_0/> and suppress their cults, but apostasy was sought, rather than capital punishment. A year after its due deadline, the <a4_0>edict expired."}
