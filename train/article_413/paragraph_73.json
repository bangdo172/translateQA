At some time around 302, a report of ominous haruspicy in Diocletian's domus and a subsequent (but undated) dictat of placatory sacrifice by the entire military triggered a series of edicts against Christianity. The first (<a1_0>303 AD<a1_0/>) \"ordered the destruction of church buildings and Christian texts, forbade services to be held, degraded of\ufb01cials who were Christians, re-enslaved imperial freedmen who were Christians, and reduced the <a2_0>legal rights<a2_0/> of all Christians... [Physical] or capital punishments were not imposed on them\" but soon after, several Christians suspected of attempted arson in the palace were executed. The second edict threatened Christian priests with <a3_0>imprisonment<a3_0/> and the third offered them freedom if they performed sacrifice. An edict of 304 enjoined universal sacrifice to <a4_0>traditional gods<a4_0/>, in terms that recall the Decian edict."}
