There was no principle analogous to separation of <a1_0>church and state<a1_0/> in ancient Rome. During the Roman Republic (<a2_0>509\u201327 BC<a2_0/>), the same men who were elected public officials might also serve as augurs and pontiffs. Priests married, raised families, and led politically active lives. Julius Caesar became pontifex maximus before he was elected consul. The augurs read the will of the gods and supervised the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to serve the public good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially <a3_0>Jupiter<a3_0/>, who embodied just rule. As a result of the <a4_0>Punic Wars<a4_0/> (264\u2013146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success."}
