Individuals or collegial associations could offer funds and cult to state deities. The public <a3_0>Vestals<a3_0/> prepared ritual substances for use in public and private cults, and held the state-funded (thus public) opening ceremony for the Parentalia festival, which was otherwise a private rite to household ancestors.
