The exta were exposed for litatio (divine approval) as part of Roman liturgy, but were \"read\" in the context of the <a1_0>disciplina Etrusca<a1_0/>. As a product of Roman sacrifice, the <a2_0>exta and blood<a2_0/> are reserved for the gods, while the <a3_0>meat<a3_0/> (viscera) is shared among human beings in a communal meal. The exta of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot (olla or aula), while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers. When the deity's portion was cooked, it was sprinkled with mola salsa (ritually prepared salted flour) and wine, then placed in the <a4_0>fire on the altar<a4_0/> for the offering; the technical verb for this action was porricere."}
