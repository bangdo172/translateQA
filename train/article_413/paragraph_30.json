The <a1_0>highest<a1_0/> authority within a community usually sponsored its cults and sacrifices, officiated as its priest and promoted its assistants and acolytes. <a2_0>Specialists<a2_0/> from the religious colleges and professionals such as haruspices and oracles were available for consultation. In household cult, the <a3_0>paterfamilias<a3_0/> functioned as priest, and members of his familia as acolytes and assistants. Public cults required greater knowledge and expertise. The earliest public priesthoods were probably the <a4_0>flamines<a4_0/> (the singular is flamen), attributed to king Numa: the major flamines, dedicated to Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus, were traditionally drawn from patrician families. Twelve lesser flamines were each dedicated to a single deity, whose archaic nature is indicated by the relative obscurity of some. Flamines were constrained by the requirements of ritual purity; Jupiter's flamen in particular had virtually no simultaneous capacity for a political or military career."}
