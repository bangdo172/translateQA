Rome's affinity to the Latins allowed two Latin cults within the pomoerium: and the cult to <a2_0>Hercules<a2_0/> at the ara maxima in the Forum Boarium was established through commercial connections with Tibur. and the Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of <a3_0>cavalry<a3_0/> found a home close to the Forum Romanum: Juno Sospita and Juno Regina were brought from Italy, and Fortuna Primigenia from Praeneste. In 217, Venus was brought from <a4_0>Sicily<a4_0/> and installed in a temple on the Capitoline hill."}
