Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the <a1_0>patrician elite<a1_0/>: kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices. In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, <a2_0>plebeians<a2_0/> were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge. They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law. The senate appointed <a3_0>Camillus<a3_0/> as dictator to handle the emergency; he negotiated a settlement, and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to <a4_0>Concordia<a4_0/>. The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public. Plebeian tribunes were appointed, with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate. In principle, the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians. In reality, the patrician and to a lesser extent, plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond."}
