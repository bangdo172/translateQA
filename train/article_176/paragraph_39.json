The literal meaning of the Spanish word <a1_0>rambla<a1_0/> is \"avenue\" or \"watercourse\", but in the Americas it is mostly used as <a2_0>\"coastal avenue\"<a2_0/>, and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the R\u00edo de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites, though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas (\"United Nations\"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it."}
