On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Sol\u00eds Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of <a2_0>18 de Julio Avenue<a2_0/>, the city's most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings, three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights. The avenue leads to the Obelisk of Montevideo; beyond that is Parque Batlle, which along with the Parque Prado is another important tourist destination.
