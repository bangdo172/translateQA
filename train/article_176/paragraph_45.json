The art studios went into protest mode, with <a2_0>Rimer Cardillo<a2_0/>, one of the country's leading <a1_0>artists<a1_0/>, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a \"hotbed of resistance\". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later."}
