The female population was <a2_0>707,697<a2_0/> (53.4%) while the male population accounted for <a3_0>618,271<a3_0/> (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of \u22121.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975\u20131985, which showed a rate of \u22125.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with life expectancy at birth for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years."}
