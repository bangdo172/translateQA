There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by <a0_0><a1_0>exclusivists<a1_0/><a0_0/>, who believe they are the chosen people or <b5_0>have exclusive access to <b8_0>absolute truth<b8_0/>, generally <b9_0>through revelation or encounter with the Divine<b9_0/><b5_0/>, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is religious <a2_0>pluralism<a2_0/>. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is <a3_0><b6_0>supersessionism<b6_0/><a3_0/>, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being <a4_0>universalism<a4_0/>: the doctrine that <b7_0>salvation<b7_0/> is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is syncretism, mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the New Age movement."}
