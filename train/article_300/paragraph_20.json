Muslims believe that the purpose of existence is <a0_0><b6_0>to worship God<b6_0/><a0_0/>. He is viewed as a personal God and there are no intermediaries, such as <b7_0>clergy<b7_0/>, to contact God. Prayer often also includes <b8_0>supplication and asking <a2_0>forgiveness<b8_0/><a2_0/>. God is often believed to be <a3_0>forgiving<a3_0/>. For example, a hadith states God would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked repentance. Christian theologian Alister McGrath writes that there are good reasons to suggest that <a1_0>a \"personal god\"<a1_0/> is integral to the Christian outlook, but that <b4_0>one has to understand it is an analogy<b4_0/>. \"To say that God is like a person is to affirm the divine ability and willingness to relate to others. This does not imply that God is human, or located at a specific point in the universe.\""}
