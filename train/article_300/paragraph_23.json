Some theists agree that none of the arguments for God's existence are compelling, but argue that faith is not a product of reason, but requires <b6_0>risk<b6_0/>. There would be no risk, they say, if the arguments for God's existence were as solid as the laws of logic, a position summed up by <a1_0>Pascal<a1_0/> as \"the heart has reasons of which reason does not know.\" A recent theory using concepts from <b7_0>physics and neurophysiology<b7_0/> proposes that God can be conceptualized within the theory of integrative level."}
