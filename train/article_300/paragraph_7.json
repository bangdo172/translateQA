Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent; thus, God is simultaneously infinite and in some way present in the affairs of the world. Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions, but each usually subscribes to some of them (see, by way of comparison, family resemblance). <a6_0>Catholic<a6_0/> theology holds that <a0_0>God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time<a0_0/>. Most theists hold that <a5_0>God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent,<a5_0/> although this belief raises questions about <a2_0>God's responsibility for <b11_0>evil and suffering in the world<b11_0/><a2_0/>. Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. Open Theism, by contrast, asserts that, <b12_0>due to the nature of time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future<b12_0/>.
