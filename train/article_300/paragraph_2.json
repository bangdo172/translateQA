In the ancient Egyptian era of <a5_0>Atenism<a5_0/>, possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called <a2_0>Aten<a2_0/>, premised on being the one \"true\" Supreme Being and Creator of the Universe. In the Hebrew Bible and Judaism, \"He Who Is\", \"I Am that I Am\", and the tetragrammaton <a6_0>YHWH<a6_0/> are used as <b10_0>names of God<b10_0/>, while <a0_0><a7_0>Yahweh and Jehovah<a7_0/><a0_0/> are sometimes used in Christianity as <b11_0>vocalizations of YHWH<b11_0/>. In the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, God, consubstantial in <b14_0>three<b14_0/> persons, is called <a1_0>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit<a1_0/>. In Judaism, it is common to refer to God by the titular names <a8_0>Elohim or Adonai<a8_0/>, the latter of which is believed by some scholars to descend from the Egyptian <a9_0>Aten<a9_0/>. In Islam, the name <a3_0>Allah<a3_0/>, \"Al-El\", or \"Al-Elah\" (\"the God\") is used, while Muslims also have a multitude of titular names for God. In Hinduism, Brahman is often considered <b12_0>a monistic deity<b12_0/>. Other religions have names for God, for instance, <a4_0>Baha<a4_0/> in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, <b13_0>Waheguru<b13_0/> in Sikhism, and Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism."}
