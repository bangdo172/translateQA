These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq in <a0_0><a3_0><b4_0><b7_0>1990<b7_0/><b4_0/><a3_0/><a0_0/> and had the explicit purpose \"to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to <a2_0><b6_0>people-centered policies<b6_0/><a2_0/>\". To produce the Human Development Reports, Mahbub ul Haq formed a group of development economists including Paul Streeten, Frances Stewart, Gustav Ranis, Keith Griffin, Sudhir Anand, and Meghnad Desai. Working alongside Nobel laureate <a1_0><b5_0>Amartya Sen<b5_0/><a1_0/>, they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework. Haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being. Sen initially opposed this idea, but he soon went on to help Haq develop the Index. Sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index, but Haq persuaded him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well-being."}
