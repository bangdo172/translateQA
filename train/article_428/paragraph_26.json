At a more practical level, the question translates into one about how to make transnational policing institutions democratically accountable (Sheptycki, 2004). For example, according to the Global Accountability Report for 2007 (<a0_0><b4_0>Lloyd, et al.<b4_0/><a0_0/> 2007) <a1_0><b5_0>Interpol<b5_0/><a1_0/> had the lowest scores in its category (IGOs), coming in tenth with a score of <a2_0><b6_0>22%<b6_0/><a2_0/> on overall accountability capabilities (p. 19). As this report points out, and the existing academic literature on transnational policing seems to confirm, <a3_0><b7_0><b8_0>this is a secretive area and one not open to civil society involvement<b8_0/><b7_0/><a3_0/>."}
