For example, in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about <a1_0><b6_0>anarchist agitators and other political radicals<b6_0/><a1_0/>. A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by <a2_0><b7_0>Prussian<b7_0/><a2_0/> police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London. The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe, which eventually led to the establishment of <a3_0><b8_0>Interpol<b8_0/><a3_0/> before the Second World War. There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century (Nadelmann, 1993). It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception. It is also generally agreed that in the <a4_0><b9_0>post\u2013Cold War<b9_0/><a4_0/> era this type of practice became more significant and frequent (Sheptycki, 2000)."}
