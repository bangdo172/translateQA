The marshalcy dates back to the Hundred Years' 'War, and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century.

The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337. Under King Francis I (who reigned 1515\u20131547), the Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e was merged with the Constabulary. The resulting force was also known as the Mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e, or, formally, the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France."}
