The court further held that during an investigatory stop a police officer's search \" [is] confined to <a2_0><b6_0><b7_0>what [is] minimally necessary to determine whether [a suspect] is armed<b7_0/><b6_0/><a2_0/>, and the intrusion, which [is] made for the sole purpose of protecting himself and others nearby, [is] confined to ascertaining the presence of weapons\" (U.S. Supreme Court). Before Terry, every police encounter constituted an arrest, giving the police officer the full range of search authority. Search authority during a Terry stop (investigatory stop) is limited to weapons only."}
