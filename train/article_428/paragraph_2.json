In Jin, dozens of prefects were spread across the state, each having limited authority and employment period. They were appointed by local magistrates, who reported to higher authorities such as governors, who in turn were appointed by the emperor, and they oversaw the civil administration of their \"prefecture\", or jurisdiction. Under each prefect were \"subprefects\" who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area. Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations, much like modern police detectives. Prefects could also be women. The concept of the \"prefecture system\" spread to other cultures such as <a3_0><b8_0>Korea and Japan<b8_0/><a3_0/>."}
