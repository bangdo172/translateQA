Because the city is located on <a1_0>the Indo-Gangetic Plain<a1_0/>, there is little difference in elevation across the city. New Delhi and surrounding areas were once a part of the Aravalli Range; all that is left of those mountains is the Delhi Ridge, which is also called <a2_0>the Lungs of Delhi<a2_0/>. While New Delhi lies on the floodplains of the <a3_0>Yamuna River<a3_0/>, it is essentially a landlocked city. East of the river is the urban area of Shahdara. New Delhi falls under the <a4_0>seismic zone-IV<a4_0/>, making it vulnerable to earthquakes."}
