The database cross-referenced logs of Wikipedia edits with publicly available records pertaining to the internet IP addresses edits were made from. Griffith was motivated by the <b6_0>edits from the <a1_0>United States Congress<b6_0/><a1_0/>, and wanted to see if others were similarly promoting themselves. The tool was designed to <b7_0>detect <a2_0>conflict of interest edits<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Among his findings were that FBI computers were used to <b8_0>edit the FBI article in Wikipedia<b8_0/>. Although the edits correlated with known FBI IP addresses, there was no proof that the changes actually came from a member or employee of the FBI, only that someone who had access to their network had edited the FBI article in Wikipedia. <b5_0>Wikipedia<b5_0/> spokespersons received Griffith's \"WikiScanner\" <a4_0><b9_0>positively<b9_0/><a4_0/>, noting that it helped prevent conflicts of interest from influencing articles as well as increasing <a3_0>transparency<a3_0/> and mitigating attempts to remove or distort relevant facts."}
