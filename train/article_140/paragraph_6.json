The UCR focuses its data collection on <a1_0><b4_0>violent crimes, hate crimes, and property crimes<b4_0/><a1_0/>. Created in the <a2_0><b5_0>1920s<b5_0/><a2_0/>, the UCR system has not proven to be as uniform as its name implies. The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape.
