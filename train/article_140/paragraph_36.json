Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category. The Group A offenses are <b7_0>46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories<b7_0/>. Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system. In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information. The <a4_0><b8_0>NIBRS<b8_0/><a4_0/> system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system. As of 2004, <b9_0>5,271<b9_0/> law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data. That amount represents 20% of the United States population and 16% of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI."}
