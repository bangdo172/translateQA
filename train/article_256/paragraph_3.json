Nara was abandoned after only <a1_0>70<a1_0/> years in part due to <b6_0>the ascendancy of D\u014dky\u014d and the encroaching secular power of the <a2_0>Buddhist<a2_0/> institutions there<b6_0/>. Ky\u014dto had good river access to the sea and <b7_0>could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces<b7_0/>. The early Heian period (<a3_0>784\u2013967<a3_0/>) continued Nara culture; the Heian capital was patterned on the Chinese <a4_0>Tang<a4_0/> capital at Chang'an, as was Nara, but on a larger scale than Nara. Kammu endeavoured to improve the Tang-style administrative system which was in use. Known as the <b8_0>ritsury\u014d<b8_0/>, this system attempted to recreate the Tang imperium in Japan, despite the \"tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries\". Despite the decline of the Taika-Taih\u014d reforms, imperial government was vigorous during the early Heian period. Indeed, Kammu's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles, and he became recognized as one of Japan's most forceful emperors."}
