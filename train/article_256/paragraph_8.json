There was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature. Two types of phonetic Japanese script: <a0_0>katakana<a0_0/>, a simplified script that was developed by using parts of <b6_0>Chinese characters<b6_0/>, was abbreviated to <a1_0>hiragana<a1_0/>, a cursive syllabary with a distinct writing method that was uniquely Japanese. <b7_0>Hiragana<b7_0/> gave written expression to the spoken word and, with it, to the rise in <b8_0>Japan's famous vernacular literature<b8_0/>, much of it written by court women who had not been trained in Chinese as had their male counterparts. Three late tenth century and early eleventh century women presented their views of life and romance at the Heian court in Kager\u014d Nikki by \"the mother of Fujiwara Michitsuna\", The Pillow Book by <a2_0>Sei Sh\u014dnagon<a2_0/> and The Tale of Genji by <a3_0>Murasaki Shikibu<a3_0/>. Indigenous art also flourished under the Fujiwara after centuries of imitating Chinese forms. Vividly colored <a4_0>yamato-e<a4_0/>, <b9_0>Japanese style paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines<b9_0/> became common in the mid- and late Heian periods, setting patterns for Japanese art to this day."}
