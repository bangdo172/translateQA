Shingon is the Japanese transmission of the Chinese Chen Yen school. Shingon, brought to Japan by the monk <a2_0>K\u016bkai<a2_0/>, emphasizes Esoteric Buddhism. Both K\u016bkai and Saich\u014d aimed to connect state and religion and establish support from the aristocracy, leading to the notion of 'aristocratic Buddhism'. An important element of Tendai doctrine was the suggestion that enlightenment was accessible to \"<a3_0>every creature<a3_0/>\". <b7_0>Saich\u014d<b7_0/> also sought independent ordination for Tendai monks. A close relationship developed between the Tendai monastery complex on Mount Hiei and the <b8_0>imperial court<b8_0/> in its new capital at the foot of the mountain. As a result, Tendai emphasized great reverence for the emperor and the nation. Kammu himself was a notable patron of the otherworldly Tendai sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries. K\u016bkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded Emperor Kammu, and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture. Shingon, through its use of \"rich symbols, rituals and mandalas\" held a wide-ranging appeal."}
