Through the new <a2_0><b6_0>Emperor's Private Office<b6_0/><a2_0/>, the emperor could issue administrative edicts more directly and with more self-assurance than before. The new <a1_0><b7_0>Metropolitan Police Board<b7_0/><a1_0/> replaced the largely ceremonial imperial guard units. While these two offices strengthened the emperor's position temporarily, soon they and other Chinese-style structures were bypassed in the developing state. In <a3_0>838<a3_0/> the end of the imperial-sanctioned missions to Tang <b8_0>China<b8_0/>, which had begun in 630, marked the effective end of Chinese influence. Tang China was in a state of decline, and Chinese Buddhists were severely persecuted, undermining Japanese respect for Chinese institutions. Japan began to turn inward."}
