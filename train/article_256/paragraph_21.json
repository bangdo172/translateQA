The control of <a0_0>rice<a0_0/> fields provided a key source of income for families such as the Fujiwara and were a fundamental base for their power. The aristocratic beneficiaries of Heian culture, the <a1_0>Ry\u014dmin<a1_0/> (\u826f\u6c11 \"Good People\") numbered about five thousand in a land of perhaps five million. One reason the samurai were able to take power was that <b7_0>the ruling nobility<b7_0/> proved incompetent at managing Japan and its provinces. By the year <a2_0>1000<a2_0/> the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing. Instead of a fully realised system of money circulation, <a3_0>rice<a3_0/> was the primary unit of exchange. The lack of a solid medium of economic exchange is implicitly illustrated in novels of the time. For instance, <b8_0>messengers<b8_0/> were rewarded with useful objects, e.g., an old silk kimono, rather than paid a fee."}
