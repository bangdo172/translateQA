Examples include \"beautiful\" (\u7f8e b\u00ed is the literary form), whose vernacular morpheme su\u00ed is represented by characters like \u5aa0 (an obsolete character), \u5a4e (a vernacular reading of this character) and even \u6c34 (transliteration of the sound su\u00ed), or \"tall\" (\u9ad8 ko is the literary form), whose morpheme k\u00f4an is \u61f8. Common grammatical particles are not exempt; the negation particle m\u0304 (not) is variously represented by \u6bcb, \u5463 or \u5514, among others. In other cases, <b8_0>characters<b8_0/> are invented to represent <a1_0>a particular morpheme<a1_0/> (a common example is the character \ud869\udf36 in, which represents the personal pronoun \"they\"). In addition, some characters have <b5_0>multiple and unrelated pronunciations<b5_0/>, adapted to represent Hokkien words. For example, the Hokkien word bah (\"meat\") has been reduced to the character \u8089, which has etymologically unrelated colloquial and literary readings (he\u030dk and jio\u030dk, respectively). Another case is the word 'to eat,' chia\u030dh, which is often transcribed in Taiwanese newspapers and media as \u5477 (a Mandarin transliteration, xi\u0101, to approximate the Hokkien term), even though its recommended character in dictionaries is \u98df."}
