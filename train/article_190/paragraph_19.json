Prior to June 2004, <b4_0>the vowel akin to but more open than o, written with a dot above right<b4_0/>, was not encoded. The usual workaround was to use the (stand-alone; spacing) character Interpunct (U+00B7, \u00b7) or less commonly the combining character dot above (U+0307). As these are far from ideal, since 1997 proposals have been submitted to the ISO/IEC working group in charge of ISO/IEC 10646\u2014namely, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2\u2014<b5_0>to encode a new combining character dot above right<b5_0/>. This is now officially assigned to U+0358 (see documents N1593, N2507, N2628, N2699, and N2713). <b7_0>Font support<b7_0/> is expected to follow."}
