Hosted by <a1_0><b5_0>Robert Osbourne<b5_0/><a1_0/>, the network also marks the occurrence of a film actor's birthday (either antemortem or posthumously) or recent death with day- or evening-long festivals showcasting several of that artist's best, earliest or least-known pictures; by effect, marathons scheduled in honor of an actor's passing (which are scheduled within a month after their death) pre-empt films originally scheduled to air on that date. TCM also features a monthly program block called the \"TCM Guest Programmer\", in which Osborne is joined by celebrity guests responsible for choosing that evening's films (examples of such programmers during <a3_0><b7_0>2012<b7_0/><a3_0/> include Jules Feiffer, Anthony Bourdain, Debra Winger, Ellen Barkin, Spike Lee, Regis Philbin and Jim Lehrer); an offshoot of this block featuring Turner Classic Movies employees aired during <a2_0><b6_0>February 2011<b6_0/><a2_0/>."}
