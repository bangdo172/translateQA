The segments appear in two forms: individual tributes and a longer <a1_0><b6_0>end-of-year compilation<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Following the recent death of an especially famous classic film personality (usually an actor, producer, filmmaker or director), the segment will feature a montage of select shots of the deceased's work. Every <a2_0><b7_0>December<b7_0/><a2_0/>, a longer, more inclusive \"TCM Remembers\" interstitial is produced that honors all of the noted film personalities who died during the past year, interspersed with scenes from settings such as an abandoned drive-in (2012) or a theatre which is closing down and is being dismantled (2013). Since 2001, the soundtracks for these clipreels have been introspective melodies by indie artists such as Badly Drawn Boy (<a3_0><b8_0>2007<b8_0/><a3_0/>) or <a4_0><b9_0>Steve Earle<b9_0/><a4_0/> (2009)."}
