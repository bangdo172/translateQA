A <a0_0>2006<a0_0/> study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds. However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this. They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. The secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was related to local <a1_0><b5_0>temperature and rainfall<b5_0/><a1_0/> and only continued to increase in half the villages studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption. A 2012 Chinese study concluded that Bt cotton halved the use of <a2_0><b6_0>pesticides<b6_0/><a2_0/> and doubled the level of <a3_0><b7_0>ladybirds, lacewings and spiders<b7_0/><a3_0/>. The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) said that, worldwide, GM cotton was planted on an area of <b9_0>25 million hectares<b9_0/> in 2011. This was <a4_0><b8_0>69%<b8_0/><a4_0/> of the worldwide total area planted in cotton."}
