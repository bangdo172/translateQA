Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously <a2_0><b7_0>by hand<b7_0/><a2_0/>. By the late 1700s a number of crude ginning machines had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor, making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a <a3_0><b8_0>commercial chain<b8_0/><a3_0/> in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive <a4_0><b9_0>colonial markets<b9_0/><a4_0/> in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong)."}
