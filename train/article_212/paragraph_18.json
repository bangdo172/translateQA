A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the <a2_0><b7_0>chemicals industry<b7_0/><a2_0/> in the following decades. Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924. <a3_0><b8_0>Nylon<b8_0/><a3_0/>, the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by <a4_0><b9_0>DuPont<b9_0/><a4_0/> in 1936, followed by DuPont's acrylic in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's hosiery from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat. The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the 1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s."}
