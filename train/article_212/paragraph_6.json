Later, the invention of the James Hargreaves' <a2_0><b7_0>spinning jenny<b7_0/><a2_0/> in 1764, Richard Arkwright's spinning frame in 1769 and Samuel Crompton's <a3_0><b8_0>spinning mule<b8_0/><a3_0/> in 1775 enabled British spinners to produce cotton yarn at much higher rates. From the late 18th century on, the British city of <a4_0><b9_0>Manchester<b9_0/><a4_0/> acquired the nickname \"Cottonopolis\" due to the cotton industry's omnipresence within the city, and Manchester's role as the heart of the global cotton trade."}
