The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In <a1_0><b6_0>2010<b6_0/><a1_0/>, two companies (<a0_0><b5_0>Monsanto and Illumina<b5_0/><a0_0/>), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G. raimondii about 50x. They announced that they would <a2_0><b7_0>donate<b7_0/><a2_0/> their raw reads to the public. This <a3_0><b8_0>public relations<b8_0/><a3_0/> effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of <a4_0><b9_0>cultivated varieties<b9_0/><a4_0/> of cotton, but a lot of hard work remains."}
