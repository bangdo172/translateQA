The bacterium <a2_0><b9_0>Bacillus thuringiensis<b9_0/><a2_0/> (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to a small fraction of insects, most notably the <a4_0>larvae<a4_0/> of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life. The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called Bt cotton, to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran <b8_0>larvae<b8_0/>, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to <a3_0><b7_0>noninsecticide<b7_0/><a3_0/> pest management."}
