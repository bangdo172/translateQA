It was, however, referred to in <b6_0>the Book of Documents<b6_0/> as an ally of <a3_0>the Zhou<a3_0/>. Accounts of Shu exist mainly as a mixture of mythological stories and historical legends recorded in local annals such as the <b7_0>Chronicles of Huayang<b7_0/> compiled in <a4_0>the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)<a4_0/>, with folk stories such as that of Emperor Duyu (\u675c\u5b87) who taught the people agriculture and transformed himself into <a0_0>a cuckoo<a0_0/> after his death. The existence of a highly developed civilization with an independent bronze industry in Sichuan eventually came to light with an archaeological discovery in 1986 at a small village named Sanxingdui in Guanghan, Sichuan. This site, believed to be an ancient city of <b8_0>Shu<b8_0/>, was initially discovered by <a2_0>a local farmer in 1929<a2_0/> who found jade and stone artefacts. Excavations by archaeologists in the area yielded few significant finds until 1986 when two major sacrificial pits were found with spectacular bronze items as well as artefacts in jade, gold, earthenware, and stone. This and other discoveries in Sichuan contest the conventional historiography that the local culture and technology of Sichuan were undeveloped in comparison to the technologically and culturally \"advanced\" <b9_0>Yellow River valley<b9_0/> of north-central China. The name Shu continues to be used to refer to <a1_0>Sichuan in subsequent periods in Chinese history up to the present day."}
