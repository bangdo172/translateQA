Many Lancashire towns had vibrant skiffle scenes in the late 1950s, out of which by the early 1960s a flourishing culture of beat groups began to emerge, particularly around Liverpool and Manchester. It has been estimated that there were around <a1_0><b7_0><b8_0>350<b8_0/><b7_0/><a1_0/> bands active in and around Liverpool in this era, often playing ballrooms, concert halls and clubs, among them the Beatles.
