It also played a major part in the development of brass bands which emerged in the county, particularly in the textile and coalfield areas, in the 19th century. The first open competition for brass bands was held at <a0_0>Manchester<a0_0/> in <a1_0><b5_0>1853<b5_0/><a1_0/>, and continued annually until the 1980s. The vibrant brass band culture of the area made an important contribution to the foundation and staffing of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra from 1857, the oldest extant professional orchestra in the United Kingdom. The same local musical tradition produced eminent figures such as Sir William Walton (1902\u201388), son of an <b9_0>Oldham<b9_0/> choirmaster and music teacher, <b7_0>Sir Thomas Beecham<b7_0/> (1879\u20131961), born in <b6_0>St. Helens<b6_0/>, who began his career by conducting local orchestras and Alan Rawsthorne (1905\u201371) born in <b8_0>Haslingden<b8_0/>. The conductor David Atherton, co-founder of <a3_0>the London Sinfonietta<a3_0/>, was born in <a2_0>Blackpool<a2_0/> in 1944. Lancashire also produced more populist figures, such as early musical theatre composer <a4_0>Leslie Stuart<a4_0/> (1863\u20131928), born in Southport, who began his musical career as organist of Salford Cathedral."}
