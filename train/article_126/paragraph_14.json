The county was also a common location for folk songs, including <b5_0>\"The Lancashire Miller\"<b5_0/>, \"Warrington Ale\" and \"The soldier's farewell to Manchester\", while Liverpool, as a major seaport, was the subject of many sea shanties, including \"The Leaving of Liverpool\" and <b7_0>\"Maggie May\"<b7_0/>, beside several local Wassailing songs. In the Industrial Revolution changing social and economic patterns helped create new traditions and styles of folk song, often linked to <b8_0>migration<b8_0/> and patterns of work.
