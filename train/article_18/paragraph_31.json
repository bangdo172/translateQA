The few exceptions to the rule are <a1_0>Germany and Austria<a1_0/>, whose heads of government titles are almost always translated as Chancellor; Monaco, whose head of government is referred to as the <a2_0>Minister of State<a2_0/>; and Vatican City, for which <b5_0>the head of government<b5_0/> is titled the <a3_0>Secretary of State<a3_0/>. In the case of Ireland, the head of government is occasionally referred to as the Taoiseach by English speakers. A stand-out case is the <a4_0><b6_0>President<b6_0/><a4_0/> of Iran, who is not actually a head of state, but the head of the government of Iran. He is referred to as \"president\" in both the Persian and English languages."}
