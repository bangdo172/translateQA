It was not until the region was uplifted during the Cenozoic Era that <b1_0>the distinctive topography<b1_0/> of the present formed. <b2_0>Uplift<b2_0/> rejuvenated the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock. Some <b3_0>streams<b3_0/> flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many <b4_0>millions of years<b4_0/> earlier. Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures."}
