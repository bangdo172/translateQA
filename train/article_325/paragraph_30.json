The latter in particular has greatly increased in abundance as a result of <b0_0>the extirpation of the eastern wolf<b0_0/> (<b1_0>Canis lupus lycaon<b1_0/>) and the North American cougar. This has led to the overgrazing and browsing of many plants of the Appalachian forests, as well as destruction of <b2_0>agricultural<b2_0/> crops. Other deer include the moose (Alces alces ), found <b3_0>only in the north<b3_0/>, and the elk (Cervus canadensis), which, although once extirpated, is now making a comeback, through transplantation, in the southern and central Appalachians. In Quebec, <b4_0>the Chic-Chocs<b4_0/> host the only population of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) south of the St. Lawrence River. An additional species that is common in the north but extends its range southward at high elevations to Virginia and West Virginia is the varying or snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). However, these central Appalachian populations are scattered and very small."}
