The birth of the Appalachian ranges, some <b1_0>480 Ma<b1_0/>, marks the first of several mountain-building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the supercontinent Pangaea with the Appalachians near the center. Because North America and Africa were connected, the Appalachians formed part of the same mountain chain as the <b3_0>Little Atlas<b3_0/> in <b4_0>Morocco<b4_0/>. This mountain range, known as the <b2_0>Central Pangean Mountains<b2_0/>, extended into Scotland, from the North America/Europe collision (See Caledonian orogeny)."}
