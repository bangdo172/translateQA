Red pine (Pinus resinosa) is a <b0_0>boreal<b0_0/> species that forms a few high elevation outliers as far south as West Virginia. All of these species except <b1_0>white pine<b1_0/> tend to occupy sandy, rocky, poor soil sites, which are mostly acidic in character. White pine, a large species valued for its <b2_0>timber<b2_0/>, tends to do best in rich, moist soil, either acidic or alkaline in character. Pitch pine is also at home in acidic, boggy soil, and <b3_0>Table Mountain<b3_0/> pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well. Shortleaf pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species. All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats, although white pine also thrives in <b4_0>shady coves, valleys, and on floodplains<b4_0/>."}
