The once-quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when <b1_0>a neighboring oceanic plate<b1_0/>, the <b4_0>Iapetus<b4_0/>, collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton. With the birth of this new subduction zone, the early Appalachians were born. Along the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris down slope to be deposited in nearby lowlands. <b2_0>The Taconic Orogeny<b2_0/> was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians, culminating in the collision of North America and Africa (see <b3_0>Appalachian<b3_0/> orogeny)."}
