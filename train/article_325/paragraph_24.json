It generally occupies <b1_0>richer and less acidic<b1_0/> soils than the spruce and firs and is characteristic of <b3_0>deep, shaded and moist mountain valleys and coves<b3_0/>. It is, unfortunately, subject to <b0_0>the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae)<b0_0/>, an introduced insect, that is rapidly extirpating it as a forest tree. Less abundant, and restricted to the southern Appalachians, is <b4_0>Carolina hemlock<b4_0/> (Tsuga caroliniana). Like Canada hemlock, this tree suffers severely from the hemlock woolly adelgid."}
