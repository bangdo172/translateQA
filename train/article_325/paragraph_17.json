In spite of the existence of <b2_0>the Great Appalachian Valley<b2_0/>, many of the main rivers are transverse to the mountain system axis. The drainage divide of the Appalachians follows a tortuous course which crosses the mountainous belt just north of the <b0_0>New River<b0_0/> in Virginia. South of the New River, rivers head into the Blue Ridge, cross the higher Unakas, receive important tributaries from the Great Valley, and traversing the Cumberland Plateau in spreading gorges (water gaps), escape by way of the Cumberland River and the Tennessee River rivers to the Ohio River and the <b3_0>Mississippi<b3_0/> River, and thence to the Gulf of Mexico. In the central section, north of the New River, <b1_0>the rivers, rising in or just beyond the Valley Ridges<b1_0/>, flow through great gorges to the Great Valley, and then across the Blue Ridge to tidal estuaries penetrating the coastal plain via the Roanoke River, James River, Potomac River, and Susquehanna River."}
