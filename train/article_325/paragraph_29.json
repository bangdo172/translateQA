Among the most conspicuous is that of the introduced <b0_0>gypsy moth<b0_0/> (<b3_0>Lymantria dispar<b3_0/>), which infests primarily oaks, causing severe defoliation and tree mortality. But it also has the benefit of eliminating weak individuals, and thus improving the <b4_0>genetic stock<b4_0/>, as well as creating rich habitat of a type through accumulation of dead wood. Because <b1_0>hardwoods<b1_0/> sprout so readily, this moth is not as harmful as the <b2_0>hemlock woolly adelgid<b2_0/>. Perhaps more serious is the introduced beech bark disease complex, which includes both a scale insect (Cryptococcus fagisuga) and fungal components."}
