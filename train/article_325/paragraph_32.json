One of the largest is the non-venomous <b1_0>black rat snake<b1_0/> (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta), while the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) is among the smallest but most abundant. The American copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) and the timber rattler (Crotalus horridus) are venomous pit vipers. There are few lizards, but the broad-headed skink (<b4_0>Eumeces laticeps<b4_0/>), at <b2_0>up to 13 in (33 cm) in<b2_0/> length, and an excellent climber and swimmer, is one of the largest and most spectacular in appearance and action. The most common turtle is the <b3_0>eastern box turtle<b3_0/> (Terrapene carolina carolina), which is found in both upland and lowland forests in the central and southern Appalachians. Prominent among aquatic species is the large common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), which occurs throughout the Appalachians."}
