Most frequently seen, however, is the <b0_0>eastern or red-spotted newt<b0_0/> (Notophthalmus viridescens), whose terrestrial eft form is often encountered on the open, dry forest floor. It has been estimated that salamanders represent the largest class of <b1_0>animal biomass<b1_0/> in the Appalachian forests. Frogs and toads are of lesser diversity and abundance, but the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) is, like the eft, commonly encountered on the dry forest floor, while a number of species of small frogs, such as spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), enliven the forest with their calls. <b2_0>Salamanders and other amphibians<b2_0/> contribute greatly to nutrient cycling through their consumption of <b3_0>small life forms<b3_0/> on the forest floor and in aquatic habitats."}
