Shrubs are generally ericaceous, and include the evergreen mountain laurel (<b4_0>Kalmia latifolia<b4_0/>), various species of blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), a number of deciduous rhododendrons (azaleas), and smaller heaths such as teaberry (Gaultheria procumbens) and trailing arbutus (Epigaea repens ). The evergreen <b3_0>great rhododendron<b3_0/> (Rhododendron maximum) is characteristic of moist stream valleys. These occurrences are in line with the prevailing <b1_0>acidic<b1_0/> character of most oak forest soils. In contrast, the much rarer chinquapin oak (Quercus muehlenbergii) demands alkaline soils and generally grows where <b2_0>limestone<b2_0/> rock is near the surface. Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it."}
