It also grows southward along the Appalachian crest to the highest elevations of the southern Appalachians, as in North Carolina and Tennessee. In the central Appalachians it is usually confined above <b0_0>3,000 ft (900 m)<b0_0/> asl, except for a few cold valleys in which it reaches lower elevations. In the southern Appalachians it is restricted to higher elevations. Another species is the black spruce (Picea mariana), which extends farthest north of any conifer in North America, is found at high elevations in the northern Appalachians, and <b2_0>in bogs<b2_0/> as far south as <b3_0>Pennsylvania<b3_0/>."}
