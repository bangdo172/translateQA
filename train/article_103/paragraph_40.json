The <a1_0>flora<a1_0/> throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range varies with elevation. Pine (Pinus) and oak (Quercus) species are usually found at an elevation of 2,000 m (6,560 ft) above sea level. The most common species of flora found in the mountains are: Pinus, Quercus, Abies, Ficus, Vachellia, Ipomoea, Acacia, Lysiloma, Bursera, Vitex, Tabebuia, Sideroxylon, Cordia, Fouquieria, Pithecellobium. The state is home to one of the largest variation species of the genus <a2_0>Pinus<a2_0/> in the world. The lower elevations have a steppe vegetation with a variety of grasses and small bushes. Several species of <a3_0>Juniperus<a3_0/> dot the steppe and the transition zone."}
