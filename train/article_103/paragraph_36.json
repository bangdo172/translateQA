According to K\u00f6ppen climate classification the state has five major climate zones. <a1_0>The Sierra Madre Occidental<a1_0/> dominates the western part of the state; there are two main climates in this area: Subtropical Highland (Cfb) and Humid Subtropical (Cwa). There are some microclimates in the state due to the varying topology mostly found in the western side of the state. The two best known microclimates are: Tropical savanna climate (Aw) in deep canyons located in the extreme <a4_0>southern<a4_0/> part of the state; Continental Mediterranean climate (Dsb) in the extremely high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Satellite image to the right shows the vegetation is much greener in the <a2_0><a3_0>west<a3_0/><a2_0/> because of the cooler temperatures and larger amounts of precipitation as compared to the rest of the state."}
