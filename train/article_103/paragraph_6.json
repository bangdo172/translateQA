Two candidates were registered; Lerdo de Tejada and General Porfirio D\u00edaz, one of the heroes of the <a1_0>Battle of Puebla<a1_0/> which had taken place on May 5, 1862. Lerdeo de Tejada won the election, but lost popularity after he announced his intent to run for re-election. On March 21, 1876, Don Porfirio D\u00edaz rebelled against President Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada. <a2_0>The Plan of Tuxtepec<a2_0/> defended the \"No Re-election\" principle. On June 2, 1876 the garrisons in the state of Chihuahua surrendered to the authority of General Porfirio D\u00edaz; Governor Antonio Ochoa was arrested until all the Lerdista forces were suppressed throughout the state. Porfirio D\u00edaz then helped T\u00edras regain the governorship of the state of Chihuahua allowing for the Plan of Tuxtepec to be implemented. The victory of the Plan of Tuxtepec, gave the interim presidency to Jose Maria Iglesias and later, as the only candidate, the General Porfirio D\u00edaz assumed the presidency on May 5, 1877. During the first years of the Porfiriato (Porfirio D\u00edaz Era), the D\u00edaz administration had to combat several attacks from the Lerdista forces and the Apache. A new rebellion led by the <a3_0>Lerdista party<a3_0/> was orchestrated from exile in the United States. The Lerdista forces were able to temporarily occupy the city of <a4_0>El Paso del Norte<a4_0/> until mid-1877. During 1877 the northern parts of the state suffered through a spell of extreme drought which were responsible for many deaths in El Paso del Norte."}
