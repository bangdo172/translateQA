When <a2_0>D\u00edaz<a2_0/> first ran for office, he committed to a strict \u201cNo Re-election\u201d policy in which he disqualified himself to serve consecutive terms. Eventually backtracking on many of his initial political positions D\u00edaz became a de facto dictator. D\u00edaz became increasingly unpopular due to brutal suppression of political dissidents by using the Rurales and manipulating the elections to solidify his political machine. The <a3_0>working class<a3_0/> was frustrated with the D\u00edaz regime due to the corruption of the political system that had increased the inequality between the rich and poor. The peasants felt disenfranchised by the policies that promoted the unfair distribution of land where 95% of the land was owned by the top 5%."}
