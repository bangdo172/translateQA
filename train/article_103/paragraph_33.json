Against Madero's wishes, Orozco and Villa fought for and won <a2_0>Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez<a2_0/>. After militias loyal to Madero defeated the Mexican federal army, on May 21, 1911, Madero signed the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez with D\u00edaz. It required that D\u00edaz abdicate his rule and be replaced by Madero. Insisting on a new election, Madero won overwhelmingly in late 1911, and he established a liberal democracy and received support from the <a3_0>United States<a3_0/> and popular leaders such as Orozco and Villa. Orozco eventually became disappointed with the Madero's government and led a rebellion against him. He organized his own army, called \"<a4_0>Orozquistas<a4_0/>\"\u2014also called the Colorados (\"Red Flaggers\")\u2014after Madero refused to agree to social reforms calling for better working hours, pay and conditions. The rural working class, which had supported Madero, now took up arms against him in support of Orozco."}
