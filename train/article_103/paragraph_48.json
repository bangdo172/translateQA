There are two distinctive climate zones found in the eastern part of the state: Hot <a2_0>Desert<a2_0/> (BWh) and Cool Desert (BWk) which are differentiated by average annual temperature due to differences in elevation. There is a transition zone in the middle of the state between the two extremely different climates from the east and west; this zone is <a3_0>the Steppe<a3_0/> characterized by a compromise between juxtaposed climate zones."}
