During this time, two-fifths of the state's territory was divided among <a1_0>17<a1_0/> rich families which owned practically all of the arable land in Chihuahua. The state economy grew at a rapid pace during the Porfiriato; the economy in <a2_0>Chihuahua<a2_0/> was dominated by agriculture and mining. The D\u00edaz administration helped Governor Luis Terrazas by funding the Municipal Public Library in Chihuahua City and passing a federal initiative for the construction of the railroad from Chihuahua City to Ciudad J\u00faarez. By 1881, the Central Mexican Railroad was completed which connected Mexico City to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. In 1883 <a3_0>telephone lines<a3_0/> were installed throughout the state, allowing communication between Chihuahua City and Aldama. By 1888 the telephone services were extended from the capital to the cites of Julimes, Meoqui, and Hidalgo del Parral; the telecommunication network in the state covered an estimated 3,500 kilometers. The need of laborers to construct the extensive infrastructure projects resulted in a significant Asian immigration, mostly from China. Asian immigrants soon become integral to the state economy by opening <a4_0>restaurants, small grocery stores, and hotels.<a4_0/> By the end of the Terrazas term, the state experienced an increase in commerce, mining, and banking. When the banks were nationalized, Chihuahua became the most important banking state in Mexico."}
