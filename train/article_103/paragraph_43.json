But soon after the election, President Ju\u00e1rez had another crisis on his hands; the Ju\u00e1rez administration was suspected to be involved in the assassination of the military chief Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Patoni executed by General Canto in August 1868. <a3_0>General Canto<a3_0/> turned himself over to Donato Guerra. Canto was sentenced to death, but later his sentence changed to 10 years imprisonment. The sense of injustice gave rise to a new rebellion in 1869 that threatened the federal government. In response, the Ju\u00e1rez administration took drastic measures by temporarily suspending constitutional rights, but the governor of Chihuahua did not support this action. Hostilities continued to increase especially after the election of <a4_0>1871<a4_0/> which was perceived to be fraudulent. A new popular leader arose among the rebels, Porfirio D\u00edaz. The federal government was successful in quelling rebellions in Durango an Chihuahua. On July 18, 1872, President Ju\u00e1rez died from a heart attack; soon after, many of his supporters ceased the fighting. Peace returned to Chihuahua and the new government was led by Governor Antonio Ochoa (formerly a co-owner of the Batopilas silver mines) in 1873 after Luis Terrazas finished his term in 1872."}
