The northern portion of the state continued to decline economically which led to another revolt led by <a1_0>G. Casavantes<a1_0/> in August 1879; Governor Tr\u00edas was accused of misappropriation of funds and inefficient administration of the state. Casavantes took the state capital and occupied it briefly; he was also successful in forcing <a2_0>Governor Tr\u00edas<a2_0/> to exile. Shortly afterwards, the federal government sent an entourage led by Trevi\u00f1o; Casavantes was immediately ordered to resign his position. Casavantes declared political victory as he was able to publicly accuse and depose Governor Tr\u00edas. At the same time the states of Durango and Coahuila had a military confrontation over territorial claims and <a3_0>water<a3_0/> rights; this altercation between the state required additional federal troops to stabilize the area. Later a dispute ensued again among the states of Coahuila, Durango, and Chihuahua over the mountain range area known as Sierra Mojada, when large deposits of gold ore was discovered. The state of Chihuahua officially submitted a declaration of protest in May 1880 that shortly after was amicably settled. Despite the difficulties at the beginning, <a4_0>D\u00edaz<a4_0/> was able to secure and stabilize the state, which earned the confidence and support of the people."}
