The first person elected under the new constitution of 1825 was <a0_0>Sim\u00f3n El\u00edas Gonzalez<a0_0/>, who being in <a1_0>Sonora<a1_0/>, was induced to remain there. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Arc\u00e9 took his place as ruler in Chihuahua. In <a2_0>1829<a2_0/>, Gonz\u00e1lez became general commander of Chihuahua, when his term of office on the west coast expired. Arc\u00e9 was less of a yorkino than his confrere of Durango. Although unable to resist the popular demand for the expulsion of the Spaniards, he soon quarreled with the legislature, which declared itself firmly for Guerrero, and announcing his support of <a3_0>Bustamante<a3_0/>'s revolution, he suspended, in March 1830, eight members of that body, the vice-governor, and several other officials, and expelled them from the state. The course thus outlined was followed by Governor Jos\u00e9 Isidro Madero, who succeeded in 1830, associated with J. J. Calvo as general commander, stringent laws being issued against <a4_0>secret societies<a4_0/>, which were supposed to be the main spring to the anti-clerical feeling among liberals."}
