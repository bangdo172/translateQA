A possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be <a1_0><b6_0>municipal broadband<b6_0/><a1_0/>, according to <b7_0>Professor Susan Crawford<b7_0/>, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School. On 15 May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services: first, permit fast and slow broadband lanes, thereby compromising net neutrality; and second, reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service, thereby preserving net neutrality. On 10 November 2014, President Barack Obama recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as <a2_0>a <a4_0>telecommunications<a4_0/> service<a2_0/> in order to preserve net neutrality. On 16 January 2015, Republicans presented legislation, in the form of <b8_0>a U.S. Congress H.R. discussion draft bill<b8_0/>, that makes concessions to net neutrality but prohibits the FCC from accomplishing the goal or enacting any further regulation affecting Internet service providers. On 31 January 2015, AP News reported that the FCC will present the notion of applying (\"with some caveats\") <a3_0>Title II (common carrier)<a3_0/> of the Communications Act of 1934 to the internet in a vote expected on 26 February 2015. Adoption of this notion would reclassify internet service from one of information to one of the telecommunications and, according to Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, ensure net neutrality. The FCC is expected to enforce <b9_0>net neutrality<b9_0/> in its vote, according to the New York Times."}
