The platform had rudimentary software running on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system. PortalPlayer had previously been working on an IBM-branded MP3 player with Bluetooth headphones. Apple contracted another company, <a0_0>Pixo<a0_0/>, to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of <a4_0>Steve Jobs<a4_0/>. As development progressed, Apple continued to refine the software's look and feel. Starting with the iPod Mini, the <a1_0>Chicago<a1_0/> font was replaced with Espy Sans. Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sans\u2014a font similar to Apple's corporate font, Myriad. iPods with color displays then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars, and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock. In <a2_0>2007<a2_0/>, Apple modified the iPod interface again with the introduction of the sixth-generation iPod Classic and third-generation iPod Nano by changing the font to <a3_0><a6_0>Helvetica<a6_0/><a3_0/> and, in most cases, splitting the screen in half by displaying the menus on the left and album artwork, photos, or videos on the right (whichever was appropriate for the selected item)."}
