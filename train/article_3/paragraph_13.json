Users report that in the sixth-generation iPod, the maximum volume output level is limited to <a2_0><a4_0>100 dB<a4_0/><a2_0/> in <a1_0>EU<a1_0/> markets. Apple previously had to remove iPods from shelves in <a3_0><a5_0>France<a5_0/><a3_0/> for exceeding this legal limit. However, users that have bought a new sixth-generation iPod in late 2013 have reported a new option that allowed them to disable the EU volume limit. It has been said that these new iPods came with an updated software that allowed this change. Older sixth-generation iPods, however, are unable to update to this software version."}
