The combination of the <a4_0>undersized DC-blocking capacitors<a4_0/> and the typical low-impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter, which attenuates the low-frequency bass output. Similar capacitors were used in the fourth-generation iPods. The problem is reduced when using <a1_0>high-impedance<a1_0/> headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as an <a2_0>external headphone amplifier<a2_0/>. The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage, rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load."}
