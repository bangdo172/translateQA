Burning the files with iTunes as an audio CD, then re-importing would create music files without the DRM. The DRM could also be removed using third-party software. However, in a deal with Apple, EMI began selling DRM-free, higher-quality songs on the iTunes Stores, in a category called \"<a2_0><a7_0>iTunes Plus<a7_0/><a2_0/>.\" While individual songs were made available at a cost of US$1.29, 30\u00a2 more than the cost of a regular DRM song, entire albums were available for the same price, US$9.99, as DRM encoded albums.
