Superchargers became indispensable in the years immediately prior to World War II, and GE was the world leader in exhaust-driven supercharging when the war started. This experience, in turn, made GE a natural selection to develop the <a1_0><b9_0>Whittle W.1<a1_0/> jet engine<b9_0/> that was demonstrated in the United States in <b5_0><b6_0><b7_0><b8_0>1941<b8_0/><b7_0/><b6_0/><b5_0/>. GE ranked <a2_0>ninth<a2_0/> among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. Although their early work with Whittle's designs was later handed to <a3_0>Allison Engine Company<a3_0/>, GE Aviation emerged as one of the world's largest engine manufacturers, second only to the British company, <a4_0>Rolls-Royce plc<a4_0/>."}
