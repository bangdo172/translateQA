Growing building activity culminated in a \"land boom\" which, in <a1_0>1888<a1_0/>, reached a peak of speculative development fuelled by consumer confidence and escalating land value. As a result of the boom, large commercial buildings, coffee palaces, terrace housing and palatial mansions proliferated in the city. The establishment of a hydraulic facility in <a2_0>1887<a2_0/> allowed for the local manufacture of <a4_0>elevators<a4_0/>, resulting in the first construction of high-rise buildings; most notably the APA Building, amongst the world's tallest commercial buildings upon completion in <a3_0>1889<a3_0/>. This period also saw the expansion of a major radial rail-based transport network."}
