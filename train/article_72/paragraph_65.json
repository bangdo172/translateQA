Improvisation in classical music performance was common during both <a0_0>the Baroque and early romantic eras<a0_0/>, yet lessened strongly during <a1_0>the second half of the 19th and in the 20th centuries<a1_0/>. During the classical era, Mozart and Beethoven often improvised <a2_0>the cadenzas to their piano concertos<a2_0/> (and thereby encouraged others to do so), but they also provided written cadenzas for use by other soloists. In opera, the practice of singing strictly by the score, i.e. <a3_0>come scritto<a3_0/>, was famously propagated by <a4_0>soprano Maria Callas<a4_0/>, who called this practice 'straitjacketing' and implied that it allows the intention of the composer to be understood better, especially during studying the music for the first time."}
