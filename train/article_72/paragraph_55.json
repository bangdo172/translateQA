The approach has been popularized in a book by <a1_0>Don Campbell<a1_0/>, and is based on an experiment published in <a2_0>Nature<a2_0/> suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted students' IQ by <a3_0>8 to 9 points<a3_0/>. This popularized version of the theory was expressed succinctly by the New York Times music columnist Alex Ross: \"researchers... have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter.\" Promoters marketed CDs claimed to induce the effect. Florida passed a law requiring toddlers in state-run schools to listen to classical music every day, and in 1998 the governor of Georgia budgeted <a4_0>$105,000<a4_0/> per year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. One of the co-authors of the original studies of the Mozart effect commented \"I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on music education programs.\""}
