The study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had <a0_0>higher<a0_0/> academic scores. The research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores. Students who listened to rock-and-roll or country had <a1_0>moderately lower<a1_0/> scores. The study further indicated that <a2_0>students who used classical during the course of study<a2_0/> had a significant leap in their academic performance; whereas, those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores. The research was conducted over several schools within the Cherry Creek School District and was conducted through <a3_0>University of Colorado<a3_0/>. This study is reflective of several recent studies (i.e. Mike Manthei and Steve N. Kelly of the University of Nebraska at Omaha; Donald A. Hodges and Debra S. O'Connell of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; etc.) and others who had significant results through the discourse of their work."}
