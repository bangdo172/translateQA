The exceptions to this are his Symphony No. 4, Violin Concerto, and Piano Concerto No. 4, which each specify a single flute. The composer's instrumentation usually included paired flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns and trumpets. Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular <a3_0>timbral \"palette\"<a3_0/> in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the \"Eroica\" Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of \"choral\" brass in the Trio. Piccolo, contrabassoon, and trombones add to the triumphal finale of his <a1_0>Symphony No. 5<a1_0/>. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver \"storm\" and \"<a4_0>sunshine<a4_0/>\" in the Sixth. The Ninth asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the \"Eroica\" (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion\u2014plus chorus and vocal soloists\u2014in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony should be expanded. For <a2_0>several decades<a2_0/> after he died, symphonic instrumentation was faithful to Beethoven's well-established model, with few exceptions."}
