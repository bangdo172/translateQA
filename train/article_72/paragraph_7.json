They consist of the instruments found in an orchestra or in a concert band, together with several other solo instruments (such as the piano, harpsichord, and organ). <a1_0>The symphony orchestra<a1_0/> is the most widely known medium for classical music and includes members of the string, woodwind, <a2_0>brass<a2_0/>, and percussion families of instruments. The concert band consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families. It generally has a larger variety and amount of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have <a3_0>a string section<a3_0/>. However, many concert bands use a double bass. The <a4_0>vocal<a4_0/> practices changed a great deal over the classical period, from the single line monophonic Gregorian chant done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, polyphonic choral works of the Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time."}
