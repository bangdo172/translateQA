The <a3_0>high-modern era<a3_0/> saw the emergence of neo-classical and serial music. A few authorities have claimed high-modernism as the beginning of postmodern music from about 1930. Others have more or less equated postmodern music with the \"<a4_0>contemporary music<a4_0/>\" composed from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century."}
