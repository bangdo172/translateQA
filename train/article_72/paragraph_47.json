Musical forms began to break from the <a2_0>Classical<a2_0/> era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about <a3_0>key signatures<a3_0/> increasing. The art song (or <a4_0>Lied<a4_0/>) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle."}
