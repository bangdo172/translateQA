A remnant of this improvisatory tradition in classical music can be heard in the <a1_0>cadenza<a1_0/>, a passage found mostly in concertos and solo works, designed to allow skilled performers to exhibit <a2_0>their virtuoso skills on the instrument<a2_0/>. Traditionally this was improvised by the performer; however, it is often written for (or occasionally by) the performer beforehand. Improvisation is also an important aspect in <a3_0>authentic performances<a3_0/> of operas of Baroque era and of bel canto (especially operas of Vincenzo Bellini), and is best exemplified by the da capo aria, a form by which famous singers typically perform variations of the thematic matter of the aria in the recapitulation section ('B section' / the 'da capo' part). An example is Beverly Sills' complex, albeit pre-written, variation of <a4_0>Da tempeste il legno infranto<a4_0/> from H\u00e4ndel's Giulio Cesare."}
