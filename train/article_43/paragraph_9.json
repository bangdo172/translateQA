After he taught it to <a4_0>growl continuously<a4_0/>, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and vocal cords to produce a crude-sounding \"Ow ah oo ga ma ma\". With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate \"<a2_0>How are you grandma?<a2_0/>\" More indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a \"talking dog\". However, these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using <a3_0>tuning forks<a3_0/> to explore resonance."}
