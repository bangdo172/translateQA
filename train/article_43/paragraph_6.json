His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his <a1_0>The Standard Elocutionist<a1_0/> (1860), which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. The Standard Elocutionist appeared in <a3_0>168<a3_0/> British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf-mutes (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Bell's father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound. Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities. He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including Latin, Scottish Gaelic, and even Sanskrit, accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their <a2_0>pronunciation<a2_0/>."}
