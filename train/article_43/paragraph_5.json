With no formal training, he mastered the <a1_0>piano<a1_0/> and became the family's pianist. Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and \"voice tricks\" akin to ventriloquism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits. Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was <a2_0>12<a2_0/>) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour. He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's <a3_0>forehead<a3_0/> wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity. Bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study <a4_0>acoustics<a4_0/>."}
