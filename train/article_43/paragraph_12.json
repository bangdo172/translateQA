Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in <a2_0>Somerset College<a2_0/> to that of a friend. Throughout late <a4_0>1867<a4_0/>, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward \"Ted,\" was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from tuberculosis. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as \"<a3_0>A.G. Bell<a3_0/>\") and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, Bath, England, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at University College London, Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying."}
