Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the Red Wing, framed in <a1_0>bamboo<a1_0/> and covered in red silk and powered by a small air-cooled engine. On March 12, 1908, over Keuka Lake, the <a2_0>biplane<a2_0/> lifted off on the first public flight in North America.[N 24] [N 25] The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder (later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control). One of the AEA's inventions, a practical wingtip form of the aileron, was to become a standard component on all aircraft. [N 26] The White Wing and June Bug were to follow and by the end of 1908, over <a3_0>150<a3_0/> flights without mishap had been accomplished. However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell allowed it to continue with experiments. Lt. <a4_0>Selfridge<a4_0/> had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier-than-air flight in a crash of the Wright Flyer at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 17, 1908."}
