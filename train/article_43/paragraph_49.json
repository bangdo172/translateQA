During his <a0_0>Volta<a0_0/> Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a <a1_0>magnetic<a1_0/> field on a record as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the <a2_0>tape recorder<a2_0/>, the hard disc and floppy disc drive and other magnetic media."}
