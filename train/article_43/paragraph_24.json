Orton had contracted with inventors Thomas Edison and <a3_0>Elisha Gray<a3_0/> to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great <a2_0>cost<a2_0/> of constructing new lines. When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments. Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's patent attorney, Anthony Pollok."}
