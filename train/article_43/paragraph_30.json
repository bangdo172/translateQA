Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the <a2_0>electrical resistance<a2_0/> in the circuit. When Bell spoke the famous sentence \"<a1_0>Mr. Watson<a1_0/>\u2014Come here\u2014I want to see you\" into the liquid transmitter, Watson, listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly."}
