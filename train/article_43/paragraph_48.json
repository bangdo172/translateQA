According to one of his biographers, Charlotte Gray, Bell's work ranged \"unfettered across the scientific landscape\" and he often went to bed voraciously reading the <a0_0>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica<a0_0/>, scouring it for new areas of interest. The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the <a1_0>18<a1_0/> patents granted in his name alone and the <a2_0>12<a2_0/> he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the photophone, one for the phonograph, five for aerial vehicles, four for \"hydroairplanes\" and two for selenium cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the audiometer to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding alternative fuels."}
