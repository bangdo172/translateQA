On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in <a0_0>Mount Pleasant<a0_0/> five miles (eight km) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready. With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and <a1_0>fences<a1_0/>, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford <a2_0>reading and singing<a2_0/>. These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances."}
