Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves. Bell also thought that multiple <a1_0>metal<a1_0/> reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound. But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas."}
