Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: \"Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by <a0_0>electrical<a0_0/> means, so could <a1_0>consonants<a1_0/>, so could articulate speech.\" He also later remarked: \"I thought that Helmholtz had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of <a3_0>electricity<a3_0/>. It was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!\"[N 7]"}
