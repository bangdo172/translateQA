The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the <a1_0>bullet<a1_0/> in the body of U.S. President James Garfield. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly <a4_0>in tests<a4_0/> but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the <a2_0>metal bed frame<a2_0/> on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his <a3_0>first<a3_0/> test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus."}
