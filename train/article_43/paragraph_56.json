Meacham<a0_0/> explained the basic principle of hydrofoils and hydroplanes. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a <a2_0>hydrofoil boat<a2_0/>. Bell and assistant <a3_0>Frederick W. \"Casey\" Baldwin<a3_0/> began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor <a4_0>Enrico Forlanini<a4_0/> and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft."}
