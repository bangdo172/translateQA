The highland areas contain most of the 400 endemic species recognised to date. Much of the island has been identified by <a2_0>BirdLife International<a2_0/> as being important for bird conservation, especially the endemic Saint Helena plover or wirebird, and for seabirds breeding on the offshore islets and stacks, in the north-east and the south-west Important Bird Areas.
