On 7 September, Stalin called Georgi Dimitrov,[clarification needed] and the latter sketched a new Comintern line on the war. The new line\u2014which stated <b5_0>that <a0_0><a1_0><b4_0>the war was unjust and imperialist<b5_0/><b4_0/><a1_0/><a0_0/>\u2014was approved by the secretariat of the Communist International on 9 September. Thus, the various western Communist parties now had to oppose the war, and to vote against <b6_0>war credits<b6_0/>. Although the French Communists had unanimously voted in Parliament for <a2_0>war credits<a2_0/> on 2 September and on 19 September declared their \"unshakeable will\" to defend the country, on 27 September the Comintern formally instructed the party to condemn the war as imperialist. By 1 October the French Communists advocated listening to German peace proposals, and Communist leader Maurice Thorez deserted from the French Army on 4 October and <a3_0><b7_0>fled to <b8_0>Russia<b8_0/><b7_0/><a3_0/>. Other Communists also deserted from the army."}
