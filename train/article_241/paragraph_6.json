Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided, and that the <a2_0><b7_0>Soviet Union<b7_0/><a2_0/>, weakened by the <a1_0><b6_0>Great Purge<b6_0/><a1_0/>, could not be a main military participant, a point that many military sources were at variance with, especially Soviet victories over the Japanese Kwantung army on the Manchurian frontier. <a3_0><b8_0>France<b8_0/><a3_0/> was more anxious to find an agreement with the USSR than was Britain; as a continental power, it was more willing to make concessions, more fearful of the dangers of an agreement between the USSR and Germany. These contrasting attitudes partly explain why the USSR has often been charged with playing a double game in 1939: carrying on open negotiations for an alliance with Britain and France while secretly considering propositions from Germany."}
