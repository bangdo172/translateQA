The suspension created significant resource problems for Germany. By the end of August, relations improved again as the countries had redrawn the <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0>Hungarian and Romanian borders<b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/>, settled some Bulgarian claims and Stalin was again convinced that Germany would face a long war in the west with Britain's improvement in its air battle with Germany and the execution of an agreement between the United States and Britain regarding destroyers and bases. However, in late August, <a2_0><b7_0>Germany<b7_0/><a2_0/> arranged its own occupation of Romania, targeting oil fields. The move raised tensions with the Soviets, who responded that Germany was supposed to have consulted with the Soviet Union under Article III of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact."}
