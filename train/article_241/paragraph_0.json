In addition to stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of <a0_0><b5_0><b6_0>Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland<b6_0/><b5_0/><a0_0/> into German and Soviet \"spheres of influence\", anticipating potential \"territorial and political rearrangements\" of these countries. Thereafter, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. After the Soviet\u2013Japanese ceasefire agreement took effect on 16 September, Stalin ordered his own invasion of Poland on 17 September. Part of southeastern (Karelia) and Salla region in <a4_0><b9_0>Finland<b9_0/><a4_0/> were annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War. This was followed by Soviet annexations of <a2_0><b8_0>Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania<b8_0/><a2_0/> (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertza region). Concern about ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been proffered as justification for the <a1_0><b7_0>Soviet<b7_0/><a1_0/> invasion of Poland. <a3_0>Stalin<a3_0/>'s invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence agreed with the Axis."}
