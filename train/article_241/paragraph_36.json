Stalin had ignored several warnings that Germany was likely to invade, and ordered no 'full-scale' mobilization of forces although the mobilization was ongoing.

The lucrative export of Soviet raw materials to Nazi Germany over the course of the Nazi\u2013Soviet economic relations (1934\u201341) continued uninterrupted until the outbreak of hostilities. The Soviet exports in several key areas enabled Germany to maintain its stocks of rubber and grain from the first day of the invasion until October 1941."}
