In <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0>mid-June<b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/>, the main Tripartite negotiations started. The discussion was focused on potential guarantees to central and east European countries should a German aggression arise. The USSR proposed to consider that a political turn towards Germany by the Baltic states would constitute an \"indirect aggression\" towards the Soviet Union. <a0_0><b3_0><b4_0>Britain<b4_0/><b3_0/><a0_0/> opposed such proposals, because they feared the Soviets' proposed language could justify a Soviet intervention in Finland and the Baltic states, or push those countries to seek closer relations with Germany. The discussion about a definition of \"indirect aggression\" became one of the sticking points between the parties, and by mid-July, the tripartite political negotiations effectively stalled, while the parties agreed to start negotiations on a military agreement, which <a2_0><b7_0>the Soviets<b7_0/><a2_0/> insisted must be entered into simultaneously with any political agreement."}
