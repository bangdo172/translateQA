It comprises the internal (physical) level in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., metadata, \"data about the data\", and internal data structures) to reconstruct the conceptual level and external level from the internal level when needed. Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the <a0_0><b5_0>database engine<b5_0/><a0_0/> a.k.a. \"storage engine\". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often utilizing the operating systems' file systems as intermediates for storage layout), <a2_0><b7_0>storage properties and configuration setting<b7_0/><a2_0/> are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in <a3_0><b8_0>several types of storage<b8_0/><a3_0/> (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into <a4_0><b9_0>bits<b9_0/><a4_0/>. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database)."}
