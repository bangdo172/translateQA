The relational part comes from entities referencing other entities in what is known as <a1_0><b5_0>one-to-many<b5_0/><a1_0/> relationship, like a traditional hierarchical model, and <a2_0><b6_0>many-to-many<b6_0/><a2_0/> relationship, like a navigational (network) model. Thus, a relational model can express both hierarchical and navigational models, as well as its native <a3_0><b7_0>tabular<b7_0/><a3_0/> model, allowing for pure or combined modeling in terms of these three models, as the application requires."}
