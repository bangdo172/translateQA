In the relational model, some bit of information was used as <a0_0><b4_0>a \"key\"<b4_0/><a0_0/>, <a1_0><b5_0>uniquely defining a particular record<b5_0/><a1_0/>. When information was being collected about a user, information stored in the optional tables would be found <a3_0><b7_0>by searching for this key<b7_0/><a3_0/>. For instance, if the login name of a user is unique, addresses and phone numbers for that user would be recorded with the login name as its key. This simple \"<a2_0><b6_0>re-linking<b6_0/><a2_0/>\" of related data back into a single collection is something that traditional computer languages are not designed for."}
