IMS was a development of software written for <a1_0><b5_0>the Apollo program<b5_0/><a1_0/> on the System/360. IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL, but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL's network model. Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed, and Bachman's 1973 Turing Award presentation was <a3_0><b7_0>The Programmer as Navigator<b7_0/><a3_0/>. IMS is classified[by whom?] as a <a2_0><b6_0>hierarchical database<b6_0/><a2_0/>. IDMS and Cincom Systems' TOTAL database are classified as network databases. IMS remains in use as of 2014[update]."}
