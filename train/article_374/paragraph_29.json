However, in some situations it is desirable to move, migrate a database from one DBMS to another. The reasons are <a1_0>primarily economical<a1_0/> (different DBMSs may have different total costs of ownership or TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves the database's transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the <a2_0>database related application<a2_0/> (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database's <a3_0>conceptual and external architectural levels<a3_0/> should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. <b7_0>A complex or large database migration<b7_0/> may be a complicated and costly (one-time) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate. This in spite of the fact that <b8_0>tools<b8_0/> may exist to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically a DBMS <a4_0>vendor provides <b9_0>tools<a4_0/> to help importing databases from other popular DBMSs<b9_0/>."}
