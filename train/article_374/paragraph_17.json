Programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases as objects. That is to say that if a person's data were in a database, that person's attributes, such as their address, phone number, and age, were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data. This allows for relations between data to be relations to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields. The term \"<a1_0><b5_0>object-relational impedance mismatch<b5_0/><a1_0/>\" described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables. Object databases and object-relational databases attempt to solve this problem by providing an <a2_0><b6_0>object-oriented language<b6_0/><a2_0/> (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL. On the programming side, libraries known as <a3_0><b7_0>object-relational mappings (ORMs)<b7_0/><a3_0/> attempt to solve the same problem."}
