The first version was ready in <a1_0><b6_0>1974/5<b6_0/><a1_0/>, and work then started on <a2_0><b7_0>multi-table systems<b7_0/><a2_0/> in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record (some of which is optional) did not have to be stored in a single large \"chunk\". Subsequent multi-user versions were tested by customers in 1978 and 1979, by which time a standardized query language \u2013 <a3_0><b8_0>SQL<b8_0/><a3_0/>[citation needed] \u2013 had been added. Codd's ideas were establishing themselves as both workable and superior to CODASYL, pushing IBM to develop a true production version of System R, known as <a4_0><b9_0>SQL/DS, and, later, Database 2 (DB2)<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
