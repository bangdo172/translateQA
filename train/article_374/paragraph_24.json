On one hand it provides a <a2_0><b5_0>common<b5_0/><a2_0/> view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it <a1_0><b4_0>abstracts away details<b4_0/><a1_0/> of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even <b6_0>every external view<b6_0/>, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types."}
