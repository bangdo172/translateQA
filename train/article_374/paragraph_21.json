This process is often called logical database design, and the output is a <b4_0>logical<b4_0/> data model expressed in the form of a <a0_0>schema<a0_0/>. Whereas the conceptual data model is (in theory at least) independent of <b5_0>the choice of <a2_0>database technology<b5_0/><a2_0/>, the <a1_0>logical<a1_0/> data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen DBMS. (The terms <b6_0>data model and database model<b6_0/> are often used interchangeably, but in this article we use data model for the design of a specific database, and database model for the modelling notation used to express that design.)"}
