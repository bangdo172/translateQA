Data security prevents <a0_0><b3_0>unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database<b3_0/><a0_0/>. Using passwords, users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called \"<a1_0><b4_0>subschemas<b4_0/><a1_0/>\". For example, an employee database can contain all the data about <b6_0>an individual employee<b6_0/>, but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data, while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data. If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for <a2_0><b5_0>managing personal databases<b5_0/><a2_0/>."}
