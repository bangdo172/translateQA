To achieve this a <b8_0>backup operation<b8_0/> is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within <a1_0>dedicated <b5_0>backup files<b5_0/><a1_0/> (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When this state is needed, i.e., when it is decided by a <a2_0><b6_0>database administrator<b6_0/><a2_0/> to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a <a3_0>desired point in time<a3_0/> when the database was in this state), these files are utilized to restore that state."}
