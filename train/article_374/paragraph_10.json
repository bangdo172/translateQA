In the navigational approach all of this data would be placed <a1_0><b5_0>in a single record<b5_0/><a1_0/>, and unused items would simply <a2_0><b6_0>not be placed in the database<b6_0/><a2_0/>. In the relational approach, the data would be <a3_0><b7_0>normalized into a user table<b7_0/><a3_0/>, an address table and a phone number table (for instance). Records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided."}
