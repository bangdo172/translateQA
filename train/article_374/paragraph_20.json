A common approach to this is to develop an entity-relationship model, often with the aid of drawing tools. Another popular approach is the <b5_0>Unified Modeling Language<b5_0/>. A successful data model will <a1_0>accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled<a1_0/>: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. <b8_0>Designing a good conceptual data model<b8_0/> requires a good understanding of <a2_0><b6_0>the application domain<b6_0/><a2_0/>; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organisation, like \"can a customer also be a supplier?\", or \"if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?\", or \"if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?\". The answers to these questions establish <a3_0>definitions of the terminology used for entities<a3_0/> (customers, products, flights, flight segments) and their relationships and attributes."}
