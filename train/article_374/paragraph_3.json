General-purpose DBMSs aim to meet the needs of as many applications as possible, which adds to the complexity. However, the fact that their development cost can be <a2_0><b6_0>spread over a large number of users<b6_0/><a2_0/> means that they are often the most cost-effective approach. However, <b7_0>a general-purpose DBMS<b7_0/> is not always the optimal solution: in some cases a general-purpose DBMS may introduce unnecessary overhead. Therefore, there are many examples of systems that use special-purpose databases. A common example is <a3_0>an email system<a3_0/> that performs many of the functions of a general-purpose DBMS such as the insertion and deletion of messages composed of various items of data or associating messages with a particular email address; but these functions are limited to what is required to handle email and don't provide the user with all of the functionality that would be available using a general-purpose DBMS."}
