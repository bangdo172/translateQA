One such example is the <a1_0>drone fly<a1_0/>, which looks a lot like <b5_0>a bee<b5_0/>, yet is completely harmless as it cannot sting at all. Another example of batesian mimicry is the io moth, (Automeris io), which has markings on its wings that resemble <b8_0>an owl's eyes<b8_0/>. When an insectivorous predator disturbs the moth, it reveals its hind wings, temporarily <a3_0>startling the predator and giving it time <b9_0>to escape<b9_0/><a3_0/>. Predators may also use mimicry <a4_0>to lure their prey<a4_0/>, however. Female fireflies of the genus Photuris, for example, copy the <b6_0>light signals of other species<b6_0/>, thereby attracting male fireflies, which <b7_0>are then captured and eaten<b7_0/> (see aggressive mimicry)."}
