Humans also lack innate weaponry such as claws. Without crafted weapons, society, or <b6_0>cleverness<b6_0/>, a lone human can easily be defeated by fit predatory animals, such as wild dogs, big cats and bears (see Man-eater). However, humans are not solitary creatures; <b7_0>they are social animals with highly developed social behaviors<b7_0/>. Early humans, such as Homo erectus, have been using stone tools and weapons <b8_0>for <a1_0>well over a million years<b8_0/><a1_0/>. Anatomically modern humans have been apex predators <b9_0>since they first evolved<b9_0/>, and many species of carnivorous megafauna actively avoid interacting with humans; the primary environmental competitor for a human is <a2_0>other humans<a2_0/>. The one subspecies of carnivorous megafauna that does interact frequently with humans in predatory roles is the <a4_0>domestic dog<a4_0/>, but usually as a partner in predation especially if they hunt together. Cannibalism has occurred in various places, among various cultures, and for various reasons. At least a few people, such as <a3_0>the Donner party<a3_0/>, are said to have resorted to it in desperation."}
