Their feeding behavior is similar in many ways, however they are noted for their <a4_0><b8_0>close<b8_0/> association with their host species<a4_0/>. While a grazing species such as an <a2_0>elephant<a2_0/> may travel many kilometers in a single day, grazing on many plants in the process, parasites form very close associations with their hosts, usually having only <a5_0><b9_0>one or at most a few<b9_0/> in their lifetime<a5_0/>. This close living arrangement may be described by the term symbiosis, <b10_0>\"<a7_0>living together<a7_0/>\"<b10_0/>, but unlike <a1_0>mutualism<a1_0/> the association significantly reduces <b12_0>the fitness of the host<b12_0/>. Parasitic organisms range from the macroscopic <a3_0>mistletoe<a3_0/>, a parasitic plant, to microscopic internal parasites such as cholera. Some species however have more loose associations with their hosts. Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) larvae may feed parasitically on only a single plant, or they may graze on several nearby plants. It is therefore wise to treat this classification system as <a6_0>a continuum<a6_0/> rather than <b11_0>four<b11_0/> isolated forms."}
