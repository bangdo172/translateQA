Predators may <b11_0>hunt actively<b11_0/> for prey in pursuit predation, or <a6_0><b8_0>sit and wait<b8_0/> for prey to approach within striking distance<a6_0/>, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or <b10_0>chew it<b10_0/> prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both <a0_0>large and small prey<a0_0/> for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails <a7_0>venom<a7_0/> that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell. In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating. In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator. <a1_0>Baleen whales<a1_0/>, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale. Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms. Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely. For example, some predators cannot digest bones, while others can. Some may eat only part of an organism, as in <b12_0>grazing<b12_0/> (see below), but still consistently cause its direct death."}
