Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual <a2_0><b12_0>absorption<b12_0/> of the prey's tissue through consumption<a2_0/>. Thus predation is often, though not always, <b13_0>carnivory<b13_0/>. Other categories of consumption are <a1_0>herbivory<a1_0/> (eating parts of <a5_0>plants<a5_0/>), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and <a4_0>detritivory<a4_0/> (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some <a3_0>parasitic species<a3_0/> prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse <b14_0>after it has died<b14_0/>. The key characteristic of predation however is the <a10_0>predator's <a0_0>direct impact on <b15_0>the prey population<b15_0/><a10_0/><a0_0/>. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat <a9_0>dead organic material<a9_0/> arising from the decay of dead individuals and have <a6_0>no<a6_0/> direct impact on the \"donor\" organism(s)."}
