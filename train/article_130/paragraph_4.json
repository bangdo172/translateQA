Xbox Live Free is included with all SKUs of the console. It allows users to create a user profile, join on message boards, and access Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade and Marketplace and talk to other members. A Live Free account does not generally support <a2_0>multiplayer gaming<a2_0/>; however, some games that have rather limited online functions already, (such as <b8_0>Viva Pi\u00f1ata<b8_0/>) or games that feature their own subscription service (e.g. <a3_0><b9_0>EA Sports<b9_0/> games<a3_0/>) can be played with a Free account. Xbox Live also supports voice the latter a feature possible with the <a4_0>Xbox Live Vision<a4_0/>."}
