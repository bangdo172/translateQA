Although not the best-selling console of its generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by <b7_0>TechRadar<b7_0/> to be the most influential through its emphasis on digital media distribution and multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live. The Xbox 360's successor, the Xbox One, was released on <a4_0>November 22, 2013<a4_0/>. Microsoft has stated they plan to support the Xbox 360 until 2016. The Xbox One is also backwards compatible with the Xbox 360."}
