It was discontinued on 1 March 2010 but reintroduced on 11 October 2010 after negative feedback. Its regular features include a puzzles section called <a1_0>Mind Games<a1_0/>. Its previous incarnation began on 5 September 2005, before which it was called T2 and previously Times 2. Regular features include columns by a different columnist each weekday. There was a column by Marcus du Sautoy each Wednesday, for example. The back pages are devoted to puzzles and contain sudoku, \"<a2_0>Killer Sudoku<a2_0/>\", \"KenKen\", word polygon puzzles, and a crossword simpler and more concise than the main \"Times Crossword\"."}
