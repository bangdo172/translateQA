Murdoch began to make his mark on the paper by appointing <a2_0>Harold Evans<a2_0/> as his replacement. One of his most important changes was the introduction of new technology and efficiency measures. In March\u2013May 1982, following agreement with print unions, the <a3_0>hot-metal Linotype printing process<a3_0/> used to print The Times since the 19th century was phased out and replaced by computer input and photo-composition. This allowed print room staff at The Times and The Sunday Times to be reduced by <a4_0>half<a4_0/>. However, direct input of text by journalists (\"single stroke\" input) was still not achieved, and this was to remain an interim measure until the Wapping dispute of 1986, when The Times moved from New Printing House Square in Gray's Inn Road (near Fleet Street) to new offices in Wapping."}
