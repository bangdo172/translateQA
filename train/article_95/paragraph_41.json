The Times adopted a stance described as \"<a0_0>peculiarly detached<a0_0/>\" at the 1945 general election; although it was increasingly critical of the Conservative Party's campaign, it did not advocate a vote for any one party. However, the newspaper reverted to the Tories for the next election five years later. It supported the Conservatives for the subsequent three elections, followed by support for both the Conservatives and the Liberal Party for the next five elections, expressly supporting a <a2_0>Con-Lib coalition<a2_0/> in 1974. The paper then backed the <a3_0>Conservatives<a3_0/> solidly until 1997, when it declined to make any party endorsement but supported individual (primarily <a4_0>Eurosceptic<a4_0/>) candidates."}
