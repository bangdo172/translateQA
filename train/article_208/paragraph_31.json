It included photography from a photo shoot in W magazine, and seven video segments. The installation ran from March to May in New York's Deitch Projects gallery. It traveled the world in an edited form. The same year, Madonna released her ninth studio album, <a1_0>American Life<a1_0/>, which was based on her observations of American society; it received mixed reviews. She commented, \"[American Life] was like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished and all the things I once valued and all the things that were important to me.\" Larry Flick from The Advocate felt that \"American Life is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent\" while condemning it as \"a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously.\" The title song peaked at number <a3_0>37<a3_0/> on the Hot 100. Its original music video was canceled as Madonna thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq. With <a4_0>four million<a4_0/> copies sold worldwide, American Life was the lowest-selling album of her career at that point."}
