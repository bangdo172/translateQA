Psychiatrist <a1_0>Keith Ablow<a1_0/> suggests her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna at a time when her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss, the more profound the influence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that \"some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them.\" Conversely, author <a2_0>Lucy O'Brien<a2_0/> feels the impact of the rape she suffered is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Madonna has done, more important even than the death of her mother: \"It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity.\""}
