She released her eighth studio album, <a2_0>Music<a2_0/>, in <a3_0>September 2000<a3_0/>. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired Ray of Light era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef, Madonna commented: \"I love to work with the weirdos that no one knows about\u2014the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there. Music is the future of sound.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that \"Music blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color, technique, style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that it's easily as self-aware and earnest as Ray of Light.\" The album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold <a4_0>four million<a4_0/> copies in the first ten days. In the U.S., Music debuted at the top, and became her first number-one album in eleven years since Like a Prayer. It produced three singles: the Hot 100 number one \"Music\", \"Don't Tell Me\", and \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\". The music video of \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" depicted Madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism, and was banned by MTV and VH1."}
