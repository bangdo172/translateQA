Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the <a1_0>\"Madonna mic\"<a1_0/>. Metz noted that Madonna represents a paradox as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes. <a2_0>Madonna<a2_0/> was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactment of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos. Thus her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized. Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, <a3_0>Madonna's<a3_0/> concerts and live performances are deemed as \"extravagant show piece, a walking art show.\""}
