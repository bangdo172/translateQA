They were all incredibly funny ... and I saw myself in them ... my girlishness, my knowingness and my innocence.\" Her \"Material Girl\" music video recreated <a1_0>Monroe's<a1_0/> look in the song \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\", from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953). She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film Who's That Girl. The video for \"Express Yourself\" (1989) was inspired by Fritz Lang's silent film <a2_0>Metropolis<a2_0/> (1927). The video for \"Vogue\" recreated the style of Hollywood glamour photographs, in particular those by Horst P. Horst, and imitated the poses of Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard, and Rita Hayworth, while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including Bette Davis, described by Madonna as an idol. However, Madonna's film career has been largely received negatively by the film critic community. <a3_0>Stephanie Zacharek<a3_0/>, critic for Time magazine, stated that, \"[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest.\" According to biographer Andrew Morton, \"Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt.\" After the box office bomb <a4_0>Swept Away<a4_0/> (2002), Madonna vowed that she would never again act in a film, hoping her repertoire as a bad actress would never be discussed again."}
