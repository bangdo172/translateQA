The song was available as a free download during its first week of release. She also performed it at the London Live Earth concert. Madonna announced her departure from Warner Bros. Records, and a new $120 million, ten-year 360 deal with <a1_0>Live Nation<a1_0/>. She produced and wrote <a2_0>I Am Because We Are<a2_0/>, a documentary on the problems faced by Malawians. The documentary was directed by Nathan Rissman, who worked as Madonna's gardener. She also directed her first film <a3_0>Filth and Wisdom<a3_0/>. The plot of the film revolved around three friends and their aspirations. The Times said she had \"done herself proud\" while The Daily Telegraph described the film as \"not an entirely unpromising first effort [but] Madonna would do well to hang on to her day job.\" In December 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced <a4_0>Madonna<a4_0/> as one of the five inductees of 2008. At the induction ceremony on March 10, 2008, Madonna did not sing but asked fellow Hall of Fame inductees and Michigan natives The Stooges to perform her songs \"Burning Up\" and \"Ray of Light\". She thanked Christopher Flynn, her dance teacher from 35 years earlier, for his encouragement to follow her dreams."}
