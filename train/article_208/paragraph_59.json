They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled <a1_0>poet Anne Sexton<a1_0/> and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with <a2_0>Sylvia Plath<a2_0/> being her favourite.

The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying\u2014after I got over my heartache\u2014I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself.\" Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. \"Her death had taught [Madonna] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness\u2014particularly her own\u2014and wanted to be the queen of her own castle.\""}
