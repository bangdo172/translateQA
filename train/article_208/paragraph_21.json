In <a2_0>Puerto Rico<a2_0/> she rubbed the island's flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman <a3_0>a pair of her panties<a3_0/> and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit films, albums and book, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as <a4_0>a sexual renegade<a4_0/>. Critics and fans reacted negatively, who commented that \"she had gone too far\" and that her career was over."}
