Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than just a bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes.\" Madonna won a <a1_0>Golden Globe Award<a1_0/> for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for the role. She released three singles from the Evita soundtrack album, including \"You Must Love Me\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997) and \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\". Madonna was later presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards. On <a2_0>October 14, 1996<a2_0/>, Madonna gave birth to <a3_0>Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon<a3_0/>, her daughter with Leon. Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna was often ill during the filming and worried that her pregnancy would harm the film, she reached some important personal goals: \"Now 38 years old, Madonna had at last triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same year. She had reached another turning point in her career, reinventing herself and her image with the public.\" Her relationship with Carlos Leon ended in <a4_0>May 1997<a4_0/>; she declared that they were \"better off as best friends.\" After Lourdes' birth, Madonna became involved in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah. She was introduced to Jewish mysticism by actress Sandra Bernhard in 1997."}
