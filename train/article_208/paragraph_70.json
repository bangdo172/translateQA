Author Carol Clerk wrote that \"during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon.\" Rolling Stone of Spain wrote that \"She became the first viral Master of Pop in history, years before the Internet was massively used. <a0_0>Madonna<a0_0/> was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookshops. A pop dialectic, never seen since The Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep on the edge of tendency and commerciality.\" <a1_0>Laura Barcella<a1_0/> in her book Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop (2012) wrote that \"really, Madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look du jour, and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) say, do, or accomplish in the public eye.\" <a2_0>William Langley from The Daily Telegraph<a2_0/> felt that \"Madonna has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to.\" <a3_0>Alan McGee from The Guardian<a3_0/> felt that Madonna is a post-modern art, the likes of which we will never see again. He further asserted that Madonna and Michael Jackson invented the terms Queen and King of Pop."}
