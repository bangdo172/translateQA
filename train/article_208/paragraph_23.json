She said later, \"This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because it was much more than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time..... And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done.\" After securing the role, she had <a3_0>vocal training<a3_0/> and learned about the history of Argentina and Per\u00f3n. <a2_0>During shooting<a2_0/> she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah, she was also pregnant during the filming: \"I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way.\" Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: \"Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill.\""}
