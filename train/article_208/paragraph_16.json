Rolling Stone magazine was generally impressed with the effort, writing that the album \"sound[s] as if it comes from the heart\". It resulted in three singles making it to number-one on the Billboard Hot 100: \"Live to Tell\", \"Papa Don't Preach\" and \"Open Your Heart\", and two more top-five singles: \"True Blue\" and \"La Isla Bonita\". The album topped the charts in over <a2_0>28 countries<a2_0/> worldwide, an unprecedented achievement at the time, and became her best-selling studio album of her career to this date with sales of 25 million. In the same year, Madonna starred in the critically panned film Shanghai Surprise, for which she was awarded the <a3_0>Golden Raspberry Award<a3_0/> for \"worst actress\". She made her theatrical debut in a production of David Rabe's Goose and Tom-Tom; the film and play both co-starred Penn. The next year, Madonna was featured in the film Who's That Girl. She contributed four songs to its soundtrack, including the title track and \"<a4_0>Causing a Commotion<a4_0/>\"."}
