A change was noted in the content of the songs in Music, with most of them being <a1_0>simple love songs,<a1_0/> but with an underlying tone of melancholy. According to Q magazine, American Life was characterized by \"a thumping techno rhythm, liquid keyboard lines, an acoustic chorus and a bizarre Madonna rap.\" The \"conventional rock songs\" of the album were suffused with dramatic lyrics about patriotism and composition, including the appearance of a gospel choir in the song \"Nothing Fails\". Madonna returned to pure <a2_0>dance songs<a2_0/> with Confessions on a Dance Floor, infusing club beats and retro music with the lyrics about paradoxical metaphors and reference to her earlier works. Madonna moved to <a3_0>urban direction<a3_0/> with Hard Candy (2008), mixing R&B and hip hop music with dance tunes. MDNA (2012) largely focused in <a4_0>electronic dance music<a4_0/>, which she has embraced since Ray of Light."}
