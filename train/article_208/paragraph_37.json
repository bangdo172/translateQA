While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in <a1_0>October 2006<a1_0/>. The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do. She addressed this on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying that there were no written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. She described how Banda had been suffering from <a2_0>pneumonia<a2_0/> after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when she first met him. Banda's biological father, <a3_0>Yohane<a3_0/>, commented, \"These so-called human rights activists are harassing me every day, threatening me that I am not aware of what I am doing..... They want me to support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband.\" The adoption was finalized in <a4_0>May 2008<a4_0/>."}
