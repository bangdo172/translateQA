Her performance led to a <a1_0>Saturn Award<a1_0/> nomination for Best Actress. To accompany the film, she released the soundtrack album, I'm Breathless, which included songs inspired by the film's 1930s setting. It also featured the US number-one hit \"Vogue\" and \"Sooner or Later\", which earned songwriter <a2_0>Stephen Sondheim<a2_0/> an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1991. While shooting the film, Madonna began a relationship with <a3_0>Beatty<a3_0/>, which dissolved by the <a4_0>end of 1990<a4_0/>. In April 1990, Madonna began her Blond Ambition World Tour, which was held until August. Rolling Stone called it an \"elaborately choreographed, sexually provocative extravaganza\" and proclaimed it \"the best tour of 1990\". The tour generated strong negative reaction from religious groups for her performance of \"Like a Virgin\", during which two male dancers caressed her body before she simulated masturbation. In response, Madonna said, \"The tour in no way hurts anybody's sentiments. It's for open minds and gets them to see sexuality in a different way. Their own and others\". The Laserdisc release of the tour won Madonna a Grammy Award in 1992 for Best Long Form Music Video."}
