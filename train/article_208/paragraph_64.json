She has donated millions of dollars to New York and London schools teaching the subject. She faced opposition from rabbis who felt Madonna's adoption of the Kabbalah was sacrilegious and a case of celebrity dilettantism. Madonna defended her studies, saying: \"It would be less controversial if I joined the Nazi Party\", and that her involvement with the Kabbalah is \"not hurting anybody\". The influence of the Kabbalah was subsequently observed in Madonna's music, especially albums like <a2_0>Ray of Light<a2_0/> and Music. During the Re-Invention World Tour, at one point in the show, Madonna and her dancers wore T-shirts that read \"Kabbalists Do It Better\". Her 2012 MDNA album has also drawn many influences from her Catholic upbringing, and since 2011 she has been attending meetings and services at an <a3_0>Opus Dei center<a3_0/>, a Catholic institution that encourages spirituality through every day life."}
