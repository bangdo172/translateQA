Randy Taraborrelli<a0_0/> described her ballad \"I'll Remember\" (1994) as an attempt to tone down her provocative image. The song was recorded for Alek Keshishian's film <a1_0>With Honors<a1_0/>. She made a subdued appearance with Letterman at an awards show and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno after realizing that she needed to change her musical direction in order to sustain her popularity. With her sixth studio album, <a2_0>Bedtime Stories<a2_0/> (1994), Madonna employed a softer image to try to improve the public perception. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and produced four singles, including \"Secret\" and \"Take a Bow\", the latter topping the Hot 100 for <a3_0>seven weeks<a3_0/>, the longest period of any Madonna single. At the same time, she became romantically involved with fitness trainer <a4_0>Carlos Leon<a4_0/>. Something to Remember, a collection of ballads, was released in November 1995. The album featured three new songs: \"You'll See\", \"One More Chance\", and a cover of Marvin Gaye's \"I Want You\"."}
