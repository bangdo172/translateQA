Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita advocated the concept of a <a3_0>Supreme Being<a3_0/> with essential qualities or attributes. Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaitins argued against the Advaitin conception of <b7_0>Brahman as an impersonal empty oneness<b7_0/>. They saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was omnipresent and actively involved in existence. To them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and a sign of ignorance. However, the individual's sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was derived from the universal beingness that is Brahman. Ramanuja saw <a4_0><b9_0>Vishnu<b9_0/><a4_0/> as a personification of Brahman."}
