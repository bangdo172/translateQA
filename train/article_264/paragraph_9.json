Each of these four are of two types: atomic (param\u0101\u1e47u) and <b9_0>composite<b9_0/>. <b6_0>An atom<b6_0/> is, according to Vai\u015be\u1e63ika scholars, that which is indestructible (anitya), indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called \u201csmall\u201d (<b8_0>a\u1e47u<b8_0/>). A <a3_0>composite<a3_0/>, in this philosophy, is defined to be anything which is divisible into <a2_0>atoms<a2_0/>. <b7_0>Whatever human beings perceive<b7_0/> is composite, while atoms are <a4_0>invisible<a4_0/>. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas stated that size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements, their gu\u1e47a (quality), karma (activity), s\u0101m\u0101nya (commonness), vi\u015be\u1e63a (particularity) and amav\u0101ya (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything)."}
