According to this philosophy there are <a2_0>three<a2_0/> categories of existence: <a3_0>Brahman, soul, and matter<a3_0/>. <b9_0>Soul and matter<b9_0/> are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from Brahman. Brahman exists independently, while <b5_0>soul and matter<b5_0/> are dependent. Thus soul and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent. Further, Brahman is a controller, the soul is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed. Also, the highest object of worship is <a4_0><b6_0><b8_0>Krishna<b8_0/><b6_0/><a4_0/> and his consort Radha, attended by <b7_0>thousands<b7_0/> of gopis; of the Vrindavan; and devotion consists in self-surrender."}
