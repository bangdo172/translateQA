Guna, it states, are of <a0_0><b5_0>three<b5_0/><a0_0/> types: <a1_0>Sattva<a1_0/> being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; <a2_0>Rajas<a2_0/> guna is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and <a3_0>Tamas<a3_0/> being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these <b6_0>three gunas<b6_0/>, but in different proportions. The interplay of these gunas defines <b9_0>the character of someone or something<b9_0/>, of nature and determines the progress of life. Samkhya theorises a pluralism of souls (Jeevatmas) who possess consciousness, but <b7_0>denies the existence of Ishvara (God)<b7_0/>.
