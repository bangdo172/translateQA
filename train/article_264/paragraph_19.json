The first and the only independent reality, states the Dvaita school, is that of Vishnu or Brahman. <b6_0>Vishnu is the supreme Self<b6_0/>, in a manner similar to <a1_0>monotheistic God<a1_0/> in other major religions. The distinguishing factor of Dvaita philosophy, as opposed to monistic Advaita Vedanta, is that <b7_0><b9_0>God<b7_0/> <a2_0>takes on a personal role<a2_0/> and is seen as a real eternal entity<b9_0/> that governs and controls the universe. Like Vishishtadvaita Vedanta subschool, Dvaita philosophy also embraced Vaishnavism, with the metaphysical concept of Brahman in the Vedas identified with <a4_0>Vishnu<a4_0/> and the one and only Supreme Being. However, unlike Vishishtadvaita which envisions ultimate qualified nondualism, the <b8_0>dualism<b8_0/> of Dvaita was <a3_0>permanent<a3_0/>."}
