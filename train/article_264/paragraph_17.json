The concept of \u0101tman is of <a3_0>soul<a3_0/>, self within each person, each living being. Advaita Vedantins assert that <b8_0>\u0101tman is same as <a4_0>Brahman<b8_0/><a4_0/>, and this <b6_0>Brahman<b6_0/> is within each human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually interconnected, and there is oneness in all of existence. They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of m\u0101y\u0101 as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. <b7_0>J\u012bvanmukti<b7_0/> (liberation during life) can be achieved through Self-knowledge, the understanding that \u0101tman within is same as \u0101tman in another person and all of Brahman \u2013 the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality."}
