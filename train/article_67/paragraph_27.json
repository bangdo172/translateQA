However, the Grand Rapids Rampage, Colorado Crush, Columbus Destroyers, Los Angeles Avengers, and the <a1_0>New York Dragons<a1_0/> did not return. The league added one expansion team, the <a2_0>Pittsburgh Power<a2_0/>. Former <a3_0>Pittsburgh Steelers<a3_0/> wide receiver Lynn Swann was one of the team's owners. It was the first time the AFL returned to Pittsburgh since the <a4_0>Pittsburgh Gladiators<a4_0/> were an original franchise in 1987 before becoming the Tampa Bay Storm. The Brigade changed its name to the Command, becoming the Kansas City Command. Even though they were returning teams, the Bossier\u2013Shreveport Battle Wings moved to New Orleans as the Voodoo, the identity formerly owned by New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson. The Alabama Vipers moved to Duluth, Georgia to become the new Georgia Force (the earlier franchise of that name being a continuation of the first Nashville Kats franchise). On October 25, 2010 the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz did not return. The Milwaukee Iron also changed names to the Milwaukee Mustangs, the name of Milwaukee's original AFL team that had existed from 1994 to 2001."}
