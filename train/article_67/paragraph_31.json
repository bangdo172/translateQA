That franchise, the Las Vegas <a1_0>Outlaws<a1_0/>, were originally to play in Las Vegas at the <a2_0>MGM Grand Garden Arena<a2_0/> in 2015, but instead played their home games at <a3_0>the Thomas & Mack Center<a3_0/>, previous home to the <a4_0>Las Vegas Sting<a4_0/> and Las Vegas Gladiators. After 20 years as a familiar name to the league, an AFL mainstay, the Iowa Barnstormers, departed the league to join the Indoor Football League. The San Antonio Talons folded on October 13, 2014, after the league (which owned the team) failed to find a new owner. On November 16, 2014, despite a successful season record-wise, the Pittsburgh Power became the second team to cease operations after the 2014 season. This resulted from poor attendance. It was later announced by the league that the Power would go dormant for 2015 and were looking for new ownership."}
