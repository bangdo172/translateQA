Shortly thereafter, an article in <a4_0>Sports Business Journal<a4_0/> announced that the AFL had a tentative agreement to sell a <a3_0>$100 million<a3_0/> stake in the league to <a2_0>Platinum Equity<a2_0/>; in exchange, Platinum Equity would create a centralized, single-entity business model that would streamline league and team operations and allow the league to be more profitable. Benson's move to shut down the VooDoo came during the Platinum Equity conference call, leading to speculation that he had folded because of the deal."}
