The AFL then switched to a neutral-site championship, with ArenaBowls XIX and XX in <a0_0>Las Vegas<a0_0/>. <a1_0>New Orleans Arena<a1_0/>, home of the New Orleans VooDoo, served as the site of ArenaBowl XXI on <a2_0>July 29, 2007<a2_0/>. This was the first professional sports championship to be staged in the city since Hurricane Katrina struck in <a3_0>August 2005<a3_0/>. The <a4_0>San Jose SaberCats<a4_0/> earned their third championship in six years by defeating the Columbus Destroyers 55\u201333. ArenaBowl XXI in New Orleans was deemed a success, and the city was chosen to host ArenaBowl XXII, in which the Philadelphia Soul defeated the defending champion San Jose Sabercats. In 2010, the location returned to being decided by which of the two participating teams was seeded higher. In ArenaBowl XXIII, the Spokane Shock defeated the Tampa Bay Storm at their home arena, Spokane Arena, in Spokane, Washington. In ArenaBowl XXIV, the Jacksonville Sharks, coming off of a victory in their conference final game four nights earlier, traveled to US Airways Center in Phoenix and defeated the Arizona Rattlers 73\u201370. ArenaBowl XXV returned to a neutral site and was once again played in New Orleans, where the Rattlers returned and defeated the Philadelphia Soul. Since 2014 the ArenaBowl has been played at the higher-seeded team."}
