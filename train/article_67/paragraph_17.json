The only way for a player to go out of bounds presently is if he is tackled into or deliberately contacts the side boards. This was also the first year the ArenaBowl was played at a neutral site. In <a3_0>2007<a3_0/>, free substitution was allowed, ending the \"iron man\" era of one-platoon football. And in <a4_0>2008<a4_0/>, the \"jack\" linebacker was allowed to go sideboard to sideboard without being penalized for \"illegal defense\"."}
