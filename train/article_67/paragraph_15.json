There are a number of franchises which existed in the form of a number of largely-unrelated teams under numerous management groups until they folded (an example is the New York CityHawks whose owners transferred the team from New York to Hartford to become the <a0_0>New England Sea Wolves<a0_0/> after <a2_0><a4_0>two<a4_0/><a2_0/> seasons, then after another <a3_0>two seasons<a3_0/> were sold and became the <a1_0>Toronto<a1_0/> Phantoms, who lasted another two seasons until folding). There are a number of reasons why these teams failed, including financially weak ownership groups, lack of deep financial support from some owners otherwise capable of providing it, lack of media exposure, and the host city's evident lack of interest in its team or the sport as a whole."}
