In conjunction with this, the league moved the beginning of the season from <a0_0>May<a0_0/> to <a1_0>February<a1_0/> (the week after the NFL's Super Bowl) and scheduled most of its games on <a3_0>Sunday<a3_0/> instead of <a2_0>Friday or Saturday<a2_0/> as it had in the past. In 2006, because of the XX Winter Olympic Games, the Stanley Cup playoffs and the Daytona 500, NBC scaled back from weekly coverage to scattered coverage during the regular season, but committed to a full playoff schedule ending with the 20th ArenaBowl. NBC and the Arena Football League officially severed ties on <a4_0>June 30, 2006<a4_0/>, having failed to reach a new broadcast deal. Las Vegas owner Jim Ferraro stated during a radio interview that the reason why a deal failed is because ESPN refused to show highlights or even mention a product being broadcast on NBC."}
