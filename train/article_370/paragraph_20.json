One of the oldest exterior shots in Santa Monica is <a0_0>Buster Keaton's Spite Marriage<a0_0/> (1929) which shows <a1_0>much of <b5_0>2nd Street<b5_0/><a1_0/>. The comedy It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) included several scenes shot in Santa Monica, including those along the California Incline, which led to the movie's treasure spot, \"The Big W\". The <b6_0><b9_0>Sylvester Stallone<b9_0/><b6_0/> film <a2_0>Rocky III<a2_0/> (<b8_0>1982<b8_0/>) shows Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed training to fight Clubber Lang by running on the Santa Monica Beach, and Stallone's Demolition Man (1993) includes Santa Monica settings. <b7_0>Henry Jaglom<b7_0/>'s indie Someone to Love (1987), the last film in which Orson Welles appeared, takes place in Santa Monica's venerable Mayfair Theatre. Heathers (1989) used Santa Monica's John Adams Middle School for many exterior shots. <a3_0>The Truth About Cats & Dogs<a3_0/> (1996) is set entirely in Santa Monica, particularly the Palisades Park area, and features a radio station that resembles KCRW at Santa Monica College. <a4_0>17 Again<a4_0/> (2009) was shot at Samohi. Other films that show significant exterior shots of Santa Monica include Fletch (1985), Species (1995), Get Shorty (1995), and Ocean's Eleven (2001). Richard Rossi's biopic Aimee Semple McPherson opens and closes at the beach in Santa Monica. Iron Man features the Santa Monica pier and surrounding communities as Tony Stark tests his experimental flight suit."}
