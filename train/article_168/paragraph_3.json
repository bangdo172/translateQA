The discovery was patented and licensed to Bayer pharmaceuticals, which marketed the compound under the trade name <a1_0><a6_0><b11_0>Veronal<b11_0/><a6_0/><a1_0/> as a <a9_0>sleep aid<a9_0/> beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery of phenobarbital at Bayer in <a8_0>1911<a8_0/> and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of <b10_0>epilepsy<b10_0/> through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organizations list of essential medications. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the <a3_0><b13_0>addictive properties and abuse potential<b13_0/><a3_0/> of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers. Today, amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of <a2_0><b12_0>attention deficit disorder<b12_0/><a2_0/> and phenobarbital in the treatment of <a0_0><a7_0>epilepsy<a7_0/><a0_0/>."}
