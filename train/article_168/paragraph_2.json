In 1921, Canadian professor <a3_0><b13_0>Frederick Banting and his student Charles Best<b13_0/><a3_0/> repeated this study, and found that injections of pancreatic extract reversed the symptoms produced by pancreas removal. Soon, the extract was demonstrated to work in people, but development of insulin therapy as a routine medical procedure was delayed by <a4_0><b14_0>difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with reproducible purity<b14_0/><a4_0/>. The researchers sought assistance from industrial collaborators at <a8_0>Eli Lilly and Co.<a8_0/> based on the company's experience with large scale purification of biological materials. Chemist George Walden of Eli Lilly and Company found that careful adjustment of the <a7_0>pH<a7_0/> of the extract allowed a relatively pure grade of insulin to be produced. Under pressure from Toronto University and a potential patent challenge by academic scientists who had independently developed a similar purification method, an agreement was reached for non-exclusive production of insulin by multiple companies.
