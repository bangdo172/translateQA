In <a5_0>1885<a5_0/> <a0_0><b10_0>Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul \u00c9mile Roux<b10_0/><a0_0/> created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in <a6_0>1914<a6_0/> from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded <a1_0><b11_0>206,000<b11_0/><a1_0/> cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in <a4_0><b14_0>15,520<b14_0/><a4_0/> deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with <a2_0><a7_0><b12_0>formaldehyde<b12_0/><a7_0/><a2_0/>. In 1944, <a3_0><a8_0><b13_0>Maurice Hilleman<b13_0/><a8_0/><a3_0/> of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to <a9_0>Merck<a9_0/> where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis."}
