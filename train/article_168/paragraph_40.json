However, only after rigorous study and testing, which takes <a1_0><b6_0>10 to 15 years on average<b6_0/><a1_0/>, will governmental authorities grant permission for the company to market and sell the drug. <a2_0><b7_0>Patent protection<b7_0/><a2_0/> enables the owner of the patent to recover the costs of research and development through high profit margins for the branded drug. When the patent protection for the drug expires, a <a3_0>generic<a3_0/> drug is usually developed and sold by a competing company. The development and approval of generics is less expensive, allowing them to be sold at a lower price. Often the owner of the branded drug will introduce a <b8_0>generic<b8_0/> version before the patent expires in order to get a head start in the generic market. Restructuring has therefore become routine, driven by the patent expiration of products launched during the industry's \"golden era\" in the <a4_0><b9_0>1990s<b9_0/><a4_0/> and companies' failure to develop sufficient new blockbuster products to replace lost revenues."}
