This work, also based in the testing of compounds available from the German dye industry, led to the development of <a5_0>Prontosil<a5_0/>, the first representative of the sulfonamide class of <a4_0><b14_0>antibiotics<b14_0/><a4_0/>. Compared to arsphenamine, the <a9_0>sulfonamides<a9_0/> had a broader spectrum of activity and were far <a8_0>less<a8_0/> toxic, rendering them useful for infections caused by <a2_0><b12_0>pathogens<b12_0/><a2_0/> such as streptococci.
