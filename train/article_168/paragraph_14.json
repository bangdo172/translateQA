This was unaffordable for most South African citizens, and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford. To do so, they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country (using a compulsory license), or import them from abroad. After international protest in favour of public health rights (including the collection of <a2_0><a8_0><b11_0>250,000<a8_0/> signatures<b11_0/><a2_0/> by MSF), the governments of several developed countries (including <a4_0><b13_0>The Netherlands, Germany, France, and later the US<b13_0/><a4_0/>) backed the South African government, and the case was dropped in April of that year."}
