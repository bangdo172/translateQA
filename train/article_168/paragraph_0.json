The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In <a8_0>1897<a8_0/> <a0_0><a10_0><b13_0>John Abel<b13_0/><a10_0/><a0_0/> of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist <a3_0><a7_0><b17_0>Jokichi Takamine<b17_0/><a7_0/><a3_0/> later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to <b14_0>Parke Davis<b14_0/>. <a1_0>Parke Davis<a1_0/> marketed epinephrine under the trade name <a6_0><a9_0><b15_0>Adrenalin<b15_0/><a9_0/><a6_0/>. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of <a11_0>asthma attacks<a11_0/>, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until <a5_0><a12_0>2011<a12_0/><a5_0/> (Primatene Mist).
