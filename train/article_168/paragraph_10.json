The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years. Vaccine development continued to accelerate, with the most notable achievement of the period being <a6_0>Jonas Salk<a6_0/>'s <a0_0><a5_0><b10_0>1954<b10_0/><a5_0/><a0_0/> development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit <a3_0><b13_0>National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis<b13_0/><a3_0/>. The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. In 1960 <a1_0><a8_0><b11_0>Maurice Hilleman<b11_0/><a8_0/><a1_0/> of Merck Sharp & Dohme identified the <a7_0>SV40<a7_0/> virus, which was later shown to <a2_0><b12_0>cause tumors<b12_0/><a2_0/> in many mammalian species. It was later determined that SV40 was present as a contaminant in <a9_0>polio<a9_0/> vaccine lots that had been administered to 90% of the children in the United States. The contamination appears to have originated both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production. In 2004 the <a4_0><b14_0>United States Cancer Institute<b14_0/><a4_0/> announced that it had concluded that SV40 is not associated with cancer in people."}
