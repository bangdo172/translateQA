In 2010 18 NMEs (<a5_0>New Molecular Entities<a5_0/>) were approved and three biologics by the FDA, or 21 in total, which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008. On the other hand, there were only <a3_0><b12_0>18<b12_0/> approvals<a3_0/> in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006. Since 2001, the <a2_0><b11_0>Center for Drug Evaluation and Research<b11_0/><a2_0/> has <a1_0><b10_0>averaged <a6_0>22.9<a6_0/> approvals<b10_0/><a1_0/> a year. This approval comes only after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials, as well as a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring. Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs, while generating no revenue in return. If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account, the cost of developing a successful new drug (new chemical entity, or NCE), has been estimated at <a0_0><b9_0>about <a7_0>1.3 billion<b9_0/><a0_0/> USD<a7_0/>(not including marketing expenses). <a4_0><b13_0>Professors Light and Lexchin<b13_0/><a4_0/> reported in 2012, however, that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of <a8_0>15 to 25<a8_0/> for decades."}
