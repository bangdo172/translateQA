A structurally similar compound, ephedrine, was identified by Japanese chemists in the Ma Huang plant and marketed by Eli Lilly as an oral treatment for <a5_0>asthma<a5_0/>. Following the work of Henry Dale and George Barger at Burroughs-Wellcome, academic chemist <a4_0><b14_0>Gordon Alles<b14_0/><a4_0/> synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in <a6_0>1929<a6_0/>. The drug proved to have only modest anti-asthma effects, but produced <a1_0><b11_0>sensations of exhilaration and palpitations<b11_0/><a1_0/>. Amphetamine was developed by <a0_0><b10_0>Smith, Kline and French<b10_0/><a0_0/> as a nasal decongestant under the trade name <a7_0>Benzedrine Inhaler<a7_0/>.
