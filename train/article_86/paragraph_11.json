Longquan greenware is characterized by a thick unctuous glaze of a particular <a1_0>bluish-green<a1_0/> tint over an otherwise undecorated light-grey porcellaneous body that is delicately potted. Yuan Longquan celadons feature a thinner, greener glaze on increasingly large vessels with decoration and shapes derived from <a4_0>Middle Eastern<a4_0/> ceramic and metalwares. These were produced in large quantities for the Chinese export trade to Southeast Asia, the <b9_0>Middle East<b9_0/>, and (during the Ming) Europe. By <a2_0><b7_0>the Ming<b7_0/><a2_0/>, however, production was notably deficient in quality.
