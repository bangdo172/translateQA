They retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by <b7_0>the federal Constitution<b7_0/>, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate. Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of <b8_0>a petition for writ of certiorari<b8_0/>.
