Tompkins<a0_0/> (<a1_0><b5_0>1938<b5_0/><a1_0/>), there is no general federal common law. Although federal courts can create federal common law in the form of case law, such law must be linked one way or another to the interpretation of a particular federal constitutional provision, statute, or regulation (which in turn was enacted as part of the Constitution or after). Federal courts <a2_0>lack the <b6_0>plenary<b6_0/> power possessed by state courts<a2_0/> to simply make up law, which the latter are able to do in the <a3_0>absence of constitutional or statutory provisions replacing the common law<a3_0/>. Only in a few narrow limited areas, like <b7_0>maritime<b7_0/> law, has the Constitution expressly authorized the continuation of English common law at the federal level (meaning that in those areas federal courts can continue to make law as they see fit, subject to the limitations of <b8_0>stare decisis<b8_0/>)."}
