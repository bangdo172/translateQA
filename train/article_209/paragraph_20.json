Due to the perennial <a1_0>inability of legislatures in the U.S. to enact <b5_0>statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights<b5_0/><a1_0/> of criminal suspects and convicts, the federal judiciary gradually developed <b6_0>the exclusionary rule<b6_0/> as a method to enforce such rights. In turn, the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judge-made remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers, of which the most famous is the <a3_0>Miranda warning<a3_0/>. The <a2_0>writ of habeas corpus<a2_0/> is often used by suspects and convicts <b8_0>to challenge their detention<b8_0/>, while <b9_0>the <a4_0>Civil Rights Act<b9_0/> of <b7_0>1871<b7_0/> and Bivens actions<a4_0/> are used by suspects to recover tort damages for police brutality."}
