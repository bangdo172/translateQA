In some areas, like aviation and railroads, the federal government has developed a comprehensive scheme that preempts <b10_0>virtually all state law<b10_0/>, while in others, like family law, a relatively small number of federal statutes (generally covering interstate and international situations) interacts with a much larger body of state law. In areas like antitrust, trademark, and employment law, there are powerful laws at both the federal and <b12_0>state<b12_0/> levels that <a7_0>coexist with each other<a7_0/>. In a handful of areas like insurance, Congress has enacted laws expressly refusing to regulate them as long as the states have laws <a1_0>regulating them<a1_0/> (see, e.g., <b11_0>the <a6_0>McCarran-Ferguson Act<b11_0/><a6_0/>)."}
