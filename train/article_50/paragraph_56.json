After achieving orbit, <a2_0>Armstrong<a2_0/> and Aldrin transferred into the Lunar Module, named <a1_0>Eagle<a1_0/>, and after a landing gear inspection by Collins remaining in the Command/Service Module Columbia, began their descent. After overcoming several computer overload alarms caused by an antenna switch left in the wrong position, and a slight downrange error, Armstrong took over manual flight control at about 180 meters (590 ft), and guided the Lunar Module to a safe landing spot at 20:18:04 UTC, July 20, 1969 (3:17:04 pm CDT). The first humans on the Moon would wait another six hours before they ventured out of their craft. At 02:56 UTC, July 21 (<a3_0>9:56 pm CDT July 20<a3_0/>), Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the Moon."}
