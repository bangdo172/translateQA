The United States had used these weapons operationally during World War II, and it could use them again against the Soviet Union, laying waste its cities and military centers. Since the Americans had a much larger <a4_0>air force<a4_0/> than the Soviet Union, and the United States maintained advance air bases near Soviet territory, in <a3_0>1947<a3_0/> Stalin ordered the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in order to counter the perceived American threat."}
