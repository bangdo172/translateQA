They set about assembling the captured V2s and began a program of launching them and instructing American engineers in their operation. These tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space, and the first two-stage rocket, the WAC Corporal-V2 combination, in <a2_0>1949<a2_0/>. The German rocket team was moved from Fort Bliss to the Army's new Redstone Arsenal, located in <a3_0>Huntsville, Alabama<a3_0/>, in <a4_0>1950<a4_0/>. From here, von Braun and his team would develop the Army's first operational medium-range ballistic missile, the Redstone rocket, that would, in slightly modified versions, launch both America's first satellite, and the first piloted Mercury space missions. It became the basis for both the Jupiter and Saturn family of rockets."}
