Almost a year after the Soviet Union put a human into orbit, astronaut <a0_0>John Glenn<a0_0/> became the first American to orbit the Earth, on <a1_0>February 20, 1962<a1_0/>. His Mercury-Atlas 6 mission completed three orbits in the <a3_0>Friendship 7<a3_0/> spacecraft, and splashed down safely in the <a2_0>Atlantic Ocean<a2_0/>, after a tense reentry, due to what falsely appeared from the telemetry data to be a loose heat-shield. As the first American in orbit, Glenn became a national hero, and received a ticker-tape parade in New York City, reminiscent of that given for Charles Lindbergh. On February 23, 1962, President Kennedy escorted him in a parade at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, where he awarded Glenn with the NASA service medal."}
