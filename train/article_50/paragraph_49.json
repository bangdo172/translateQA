The goal was to complete Komarov's rendezvous and docking mission with the un-piloted Soyuz 2. Ground controllers brought the two craft to within 200 meters (660 ft) of each other, then cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy took control. He got within 40 meters (130 ft) of his target, but was unable to dock before expending 90 percent of his maneuvering fuel, due to a piloting error that put his spacecraft into the wrong orientation and forced Soyuz 2 to automatically turn away from his approaching craft. The first docking of Soviet spacecraft was finally realised in <a1_0>January 1969<a1_0/> by the <a2_0>Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5<a2_0/> missions. It was the first-ever docking of two manned spacecraft, and the first transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another."}
