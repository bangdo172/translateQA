The Air Force initiated ICBM research in <a0_0>1945<a0_0/> with the <a1_0>MX-774<a1_0/>. However, its funding was cancelled and only three partially successful launches were conducted in <a2_0>1947<a2_0/>. In 1950, von Braun began testing the Air Force PGM-11 Redstone rocket family at <a3_0>Cape Canaveral<a3_0/>. In 1951, the Air Force began a new ICBM program called MX-1593, and by 1955 this program was receiving top-priority funding. The MX-1593 program evolved to become the Atlas-A, with its maiden launch occurring <a4_0>June 11, 1957<a4_0/>, becoming the first successful American ICBM. Its upgraded version, the Atlas-D rocket, would later serve as an operational nuclear ICBM and as the orbital launch vehicle for Project Mercury and the remote-controlled Agena Target Vehicle used in Project Gemini."}
