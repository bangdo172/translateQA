Although some of its components (notably boosters) still resembled the <a1_0>German G-4<a1_0/>, the new rocket incorporated staged design, a completely new control system, and a new fuel. It was successfully tested on <a2_0>August 21, 1957<a2_0/> and became the world's first fully operational ICBM the following month. It would later be used to launch the first satellite into space, and derivatives would launch all piloted Soviet spacecraft."}
