Engineers reported 200 design faults to party leaders, but their concerns \"were overruled by political pressures for a series of space feats to mark the anniversary of Lenin's birthday.\"[citation needed] On <a1_0>April 24, 1967<a1_0/>, the single pilot of Soyuz 1, <a0_0>Vladimir Komarov<a0_0/>, became the first in-flight spaceflight fatality. The mission was planned to be a three-day test, to include the first Soviet docking with an unpiloted Soyuz 2, but the mission was plagued with problems. Early on, Komarov's craft lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two solar panels had deployed. Then the automatic attitude control system began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely, resulting in the craft spinning wildly. Komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system, which was only partially effective. The flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day. During the emergency re-entry, a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail, and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute; Komarov was killed on impact. Fixing the spacecraft faults caused an eighteen-month delay before piloted Soyuz flights could resume."}
