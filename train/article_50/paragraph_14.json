The <a1_0>December 6, 195<a1_0/>7 Project Vanguard launch failure occurred at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in <a2_0>Florida<a2_0/>, broadcast live in front of a US television audience. It was a monumental failure, exploding a few seconds after launch, and it became an international joke. The satellite appeared in newspapers under the names Flopnik, Stayputnik, Kaputnik, and Dudnik. In the United Nations, the Russian delegate offered the U.S. representative aid \"under the Soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations.\" Only in the wake of this very public failure did von Braun's Redstone team get the go-ahead to launch their <a3_0>Jupiter-C rocket<a3_0/> as soon as they could. In Britain, the USA's Western Cold War ally, the reaction was mixed: some members of the population celebrated the fact that the Soviets had reached space first, while others feared the destructive potential that military uses of spacecraft might bring."}
