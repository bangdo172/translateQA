Many of these groups would continue recording as part of the new <a1_0><a6_0>pop<a6_0/><a1_0/> movement, with <a7_0>entryism<a7_0/> becoming a popular concept. In the <b11_0>United States<b11_0/>, driven by <a2_0><a8_0>MTV<a2_0/> and modern rock radio stations<a8_0/>, a number of post-punk acts had an influence on or became part of the Second British Invasion of \"New Music\" there. Some shifted to a more commercial new wave sound (such as <b12_0>Gang of Four<b12_0/>), while others were fixtures on <a3_0>American college radio<a3_0/> and became early examples of alternative rock. Perhaps the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was <a4_0><a9_0><b13_0>U2<b13_0/><a9_0/><a4_0/>, who combined elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music."}
