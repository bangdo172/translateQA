The <a1_0>Art Deco<a1_0/> style of the Chrysler Building (<a7_0>1930<a7_0/>) and Empire State Building (<a0_0><a6_0>1931<a6_0/><a0_0/>), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The buildings have distinctive ornamentation, such as the <a5_0>eagles<a5_0/> at the corners of the <a2_0>61st<a2_0/> floor on the Chrysler Building, and are considered some of the finest examples of the Art Deco style. A highly influential example of the international style in the United States is the <a3_0>Seagram Building<a3_0/> (1957), distinctive for its fa\u00e7ade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The Cond\u00e9 Nast Building (2000) is a prominent example of green design in American skyscrapers and has received an award from the <a4_0>American Institute of Architects<a4_0/> as well as AIA New York State for its design."}
