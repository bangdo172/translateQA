Green and red were standardized as the colors of international railroad signals in the <a0_0>19th century<a0_0/>. <b4_0>The first traffic light<b4_0/>, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in <a1_0>1868<a1_0/> in front of the Houses of Parliament in <b7_0>London<b7_0/>. It exploded the following year, injuring <b5_0>the policeman<b5_0/> who operated it. In <b6_0>1912<b6_0/>, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in <a2_0>Salt Lake City, Utah<a2_0/>. Red was chosen largely because of its <a3_0>high visibility<a3_0/>, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is <b8_0>turned on and working<b8_0/> as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red."}
