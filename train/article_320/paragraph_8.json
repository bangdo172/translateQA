The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of <a2_0>chromium<a2_0/> and sometimes <b8_0>vanadium<b8_0/>. Chromium(III) oxide (<b7_0>Cr2O3<b7_0/>), is called chrome green, also called <b6_0>viridian<b6_0/> or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from <a4_0>small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar<a4_0/>. <a3_0>Copper<a3_0/> is the source of the green color in <b9_0>malachite<b9_0/> pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate."}
