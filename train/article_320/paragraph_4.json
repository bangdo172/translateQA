(See distinction of green from blue) These languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote \"green\", but these terms are recognizable as recent adoptions that are not in origin color terms (much like the English adjective orange being in origin not a color term but <a2_0>the name of a <b6_0>fruit<b6_0/><a2_0/>). Thus, the <a0_0>Thai<a0_0/> word \u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 besides meaning \"green\" also means \"rank\" and \"smelly\" and holds other unpleasant associations."}
