The Chinese character \u9752 (pronounced q\u012bng in Mandarin, <b3_0>ao<b3_0/> in Japanese, and <b4_0>thanh<b4_0/> in Sino-Vietnamese) has a meaning that covers both blue and green; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of \"\u9752\". In more contemporary terms, they are \u85cd (l\u00e1n, in Mandarin) and \u7da0 (l\u01dc, in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has <a0_0><b6_0>two<b6_0/><a0_0/> terms that refer specifically to the color green, \u7dd1 (midori, which is derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb midoru \"<b7_0>to be in leaf, to flourish<b7_0/>\" in reference to trees) and \u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3 (<b5_0>guriin<b5_0/>, which is derived from the English word \"green\"). However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have <a2_0>the same colors that other countries have<a2_0/>, the green light is described using the same word as for blue, \"aoi\", because green is considered a shade of aoi; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green shiso (as opposed to red apples and red shiso) will be described with the word \"aoi\". Vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green, <a1_0>xanh<a1_0/>, with variants such as xanh da tr\u1eddi (azure, lit. \"sky blue\"), lam (blue), and l\u1ee5c (green; also xanh l\u00e1 c\u00e2y, lit. \"leaf green\")."}
