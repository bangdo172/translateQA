Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of <b5_0>a <a1_0>reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment<b5_0/><a1_0/>. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. <a2_0><b6_0>Turacoverdin<b6_0/><a2_0/> is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of <b7_0>porphyrin<b7_0/> pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are <b8_0>flavins (<b9_0>lychochromes<b9_0/>) and hemanovadin<b8_0/>. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include <a4_0>biliverdin<a4_0/>, the green pigment in bile, and <a3_0>ceruloplasmin<a3_0/>, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation."}
