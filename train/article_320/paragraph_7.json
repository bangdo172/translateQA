Green laser pointers outputting at <a1_0>532 nm<a1_0/> (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use <a2_0>diode pumped solid state<a2_0/> (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808 nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064 nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing <b8_0>potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP)<b8_0/>, whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (<b7_0>563.5 THz<b7_0/>); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532 nm (\"green\"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from <a3_0>501 nm to 543 nm<a3_0/>. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium\u2013neon laser (543 nm), the Argon-ion laser (<b5_0>514 nm<b5_0/>) and the Krypton-ion laser (<b4_0>521 nm and 531 nm<b4_0/>), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control."}
