Chlorophyll <a1_0>absorbs<a1_0/> the long wavelengths of light (<b4_0>red<b4_0/>) and <b5_0>short<b5_0/> wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because <b6_0>it first arose in <a2_0>organisms living in oceans<a2_0/> where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis<b6_0/>. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using <b7_0>bacteriorhodopsin<b7_0/>. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria."}
