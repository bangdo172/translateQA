The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by <a1_0>Pliny<a1_0/>. It was used by the Romans in the murals of <a2_0><b6_0>Pompeii<b6_0/><a2_0/>, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the <b5_0>5th century AD<b5_0/>. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could <a3_0>ruin<a3_0/> other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. <a4_0>Leonardo da Vinci<a4_0/>, in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in <b8_0>Europe and Persia<b8_0/> in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green. Viridian, also called chrome green, is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate, was patented in <b9_0>1859<b9_0/>. It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic. Vincent van Gogh used it, along with Prussian blue, to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting Cafe terrace at night."}
