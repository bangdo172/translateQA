An old symbol for light aspiration was <b7_0>\u27e8\u02bb\u27e9<b7_0/>, but this is now obsolete. The <a1_0>aspiration modifier<a1_0/> letter may be doubled to indicate <b8_0>especially strong or long aspiration<b8_0/>. Hence, the two degrees of aspiration in <a2_0>Korean<a2_0/> stops are sometimes transcribed <b5_0>\u27e8k\u02b0 k\u02b0\u02b0\u27e9 or \u27e8k\u02bb\u27e9 and \u27e8k\u02b0\u27e9<b5_0/>, but they are usually transcribed [k] and [k\u02b0], with the details of voice-onset time given <a3_0><b6_0>numerically<b6_0/><a3_0/>."}
