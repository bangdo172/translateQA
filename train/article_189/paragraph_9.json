The company sought a permanent establishment, while the <a1_0>Parliament<a1_0/> would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, <a0_0><b3_0>15%<b3_0/><a0_0/> of <b7_0>British<b7_0/> imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the <b5_0>company lobby<b5_0/>. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730."}
