The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical <a4_0>Daoist<a4_0/> religious societies led by <a3_0>faith<a3_0/> healers Zhang Jue (d. 184 AD) and Zhang Lu (d. 216 AD), respectively. Zhang Lu's rebellion, in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, was not quelled until <a1_0>215 AD<a1_0/>. Zhang Jue's massive rebellion across <a2_0>eight<a2_0/> provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings. Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated, many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority."}
