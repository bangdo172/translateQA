An dismissed Deng's clan members from office, exiled them and forced many to commit suicide.

However, palace eunuch <a1_0>Sun Cheng<a1_0/> (d. 132 AD) masterminded a successful overthrow of her regime to enthrone Emperor Shun of Han (r. 125\u2013144 AD). <a3_0>Yan<a3_0/> was placed under house arrest, her relatives were either killed or exiled, and her eunuch allies were slaughtered. The regent Liang Ji (d. 159 AD), brother of Empress Liang Na (d. 150 AD), had the brother-in-law of Consort Deng Mengn\u00fc (later empress) (d. 165 AD) killed after Deng Mengn\u00fc resisted Liang Ji's attempts to control her. Afterward, Emperor Huan employed <a2_0>eunuchs<a2_0/> to depose Liang Ji, who was then <a4_0>forced to commit suicide<a4_0/>."}
