He created central government monopolies administered largely by <a0_0>former merchants<a0_0/>. These monopolies included salt, iron, and liquor production, as well as bronze-coin currency. The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to <a1_0>81 BC<a1_0/>, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han. The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty. The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court. The Reformists opposed the <a2_0>Modernist<a2_0/> faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu's reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d. <a4_0>68 BC<a4_0/>). The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy. <a3_0>The Reformists<a3_0/>, however, overturned these policies, favoring a cautious, non-expansionary approach to foreign policy, frugal budget reform, and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs."}
