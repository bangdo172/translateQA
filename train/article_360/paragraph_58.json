Using a water clock, waterwheel and a series of gears, the Court Astronomer <a0_0>Zhang Heng<a0_0/> (78\u2013139 AD) was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere. To address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock, Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel. Zhang also invented a <a2_0>seismometer<a2_0/> (Houfeng didong yi \u5019\u98ce\u5730\u52a8\u4eea) in <a1_0>132 AD<a1_0/> to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away. This employed an inverted pendulum that, when disturbed by ground tremors, would trigger a set of gears that dropped a <a4_0>metal ball<a4_0/> from one of <a3_0>eight<a3_0/> dragon mouths (representing all eight directions) into a metal toad's mouth."}
