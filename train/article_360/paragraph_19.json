Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r. 88\u2013<a1_0>105 AD<a1_0/>) had <a0_0><a4_0>Empress Dowager Dou<a4_0/><a0_0/> (d. 97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother\u2014Consort Liang\u2014and then concealing her identity from him. After Emperor He's death, his wife <a2_0>Empress Deng Sui<a2_0/> (d. 121 AD) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to <a3_0>118 AD<a3_0/>."}
