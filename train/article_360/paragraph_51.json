A significant product of these <a3_0>improved iron-smelting techniques<a3_0/> was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. <a0_0>The three-legged iron seed drill<a0_0/>, invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand. The heavy moldboard iron plow, also invented during the Han dynasty, required only <a4_0>one man<a4_0/> to control it, <a1_0>two oxen<a1_0/> to pull it. It had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (<a2_0>11.3 acres<a2_0/>) of land in a single day."}
