Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Although <a1_0>Xiang Yu<a1_0/> proved to be a capable commander, Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of Gaixia (202 BC), in modern-day Anhui. Liu Bang assumed the title \"emperor\" (huangdi) at the urging of <a4_0>his followers<a4_0/> and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202\u2013195 BC). Chang'an was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han."}
