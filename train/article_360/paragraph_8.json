In a court conference assembled by Emperor Wu (r. 141\u201387 BC) in <a0_0>135 BC<a0_0/>, the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement. Emperor Wu accepted this, despite continuing Xiongnu raids. However, a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a limited engagement at Mayi involving the assassination of the Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han. When this plot failed in <a1_0>133 BC<a1_0/>, Emperor Wu launched a series of massive military invasions into Xiongnu territory. Chinese armies captured one stronghold after another and established <a2_0>agricultural<a2_0/> colonies to strengthen their hold. The assault culminated in <a3_0>119 BC<a3_0/> at the Battle of Mobei, where the Han commanders Huo Qubing (d. 117 BC) and <a4_0>Wei Qing<a4_0/> (d. 106 BC) forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the Gobi Desert."}
