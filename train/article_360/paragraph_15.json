Their rebellion was crushed by Han general Ma Yuan (d. <a3_0>AD 49<a3_0/>) in a campaign from AD 42\u201343. Wang Mang renewed hostilities against the Xiongnu, who were estranged from Han until their leader <a4_0>Bi<a4_0/> (\u6bd4), a rival claimant to the throne against his cousin Punu (\u84b2\u5974), submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in AD 50. This created two rival Xiongnu states: the Southern Xiongnu led by Bi, an ally of Han, and the Northern Xiongnu led by Punu, an enemy of Han."}
