There, in a written petition to Empress He, they demanded <a4_0>the eunuchs' execution<a4_0/>. After a period of hesitation, <a1_0>Empress He<a1_0/> consented. When the eunuchs discovered this, however, they had her brother <a2_0>He Miao<a2_0/> (\u4f55\u82d7) rescind the order. The eunuchs assassinated <a0_0>He Jin<a0_0/> on September 22, 189 AD. Yuan Shao then besieged Luoyang's Northern Palace while his brother Yuan Shu (d. 199 AD) besieged the Southern Palace. On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed. Zhang Rang had previously fled with Emperor Shao (r. 189 AD) and his brother <a3_0>Liu Xie<a3_0/>\u2014the future Emperor Xian of Han (r. 189\u2013220 AD). While being pursued by the Yuan brothers, Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River."}
