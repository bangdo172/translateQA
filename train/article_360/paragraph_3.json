Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141\u2013<a4_0>87 BC<a4_0/>) launched several <a1_0>military<a1_0/> campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic <a3_0>Xianbei<a3_0/> confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in <a2_0>111 BC<a2_0/> and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC."}
