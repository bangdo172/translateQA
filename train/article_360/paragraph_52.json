This system switched the positions of furrows and ridges between growing seasons. Once experiments with this system yielded successful results, the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it. Han farmers also used the <a1_0>pit field system<a1_0/> (aotian \u51f9\u7530) for growing crops, which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain.
