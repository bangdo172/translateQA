Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \"Han characters\". It was founded by the rebel leader <a2_0>Liu Bang<a2_0/>, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9\u201323 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (<a3_0>206 BC<a3_0/> \u2013 9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25\u2013<a4_0>220 AD<a4_0/>)."}
