For well over a century Galicia has grown more slowly than the rest of Spain, due largely to emigration to <a1_0>Latin America<a1_0/> and to other parts of Spain. Sometimes Galicia has lost population in absolute terms. In 1857, Galicia had Spain's densest population and constituted 11.5% of the national population. As of 2007, only 6.1% of the Spanish population resides in the autonomous community. This is due to an exodus of Galician people since the 19th century, first to South America and later to Central Europe."}
