In comparison to similar latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic, winters are exceptionally mild, with consistently heavy rainfall. Snow is rare due to temperatures rarely dropping below freezing. The warmest coastal station of <a0_0>Pontevedra<a0_0/> has a yearly mean temperature of 14.8 \u00b0C (58.6 \u00b0F). <a1_0>Ourense<a1_0/> located somewhat inland is only slightly warmer with 14.9 \u00b0C (58.8 \u00b0F). Due to its exposed north-westerly location, the climate is still very cool by Spanish standards. In coastal areas summers are temperered, averaging around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in Vigo.
