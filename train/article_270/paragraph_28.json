Wood products figure significantly in Galicia's economy. Apart from tree plantations Galicia is also notable for the extensive surface occupied by meadows used for animal husbandry, especially cattle , an important activity. <a1_0>Hydroelectric<a1_0/> development in most rivers has been a serious concern for local conservationists during the last decades."}
