These are called <a0_0>r\u00edas<a0_0/> and are divided into the smaller R\u00edas Altas (\"<a1_0>High R\u00edas<a1_0/>\"), and the larger R\u00edas Baixas (\"<a2_0>Low R\u00edas<a2_0/>\"). The R\u00edas Altas include Ribadeo, Foz, Viveiro, Barqueiro, Ortigueira, Cedeira, Ferrol, Betanzos, A Coru\u00f1a, Corme e Laxe and Camari\u00f1as. The R\u00edas Baixas, found south of Fisterra, include Corcubi\u00f3n, Muros e Noia, Arousa, Pontevedra and Vigo. The R\u00edas Altas can sometimes refer only to those east of Estaca de Bares, with the others being called R\u00edas Medias (\"Intermediate R\u00edas\")."}
