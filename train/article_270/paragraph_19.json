While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the Seminario de Estudos Galegos. Galicia's statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of <a0_0>Catalonia and the Basque provinces<a0_0/> once those were conquered). According to Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Santander, at least 4,200 people were killed either extrajudicially or after summary trials, among them republicans, communists, Galician nationalists, socialists and anarchists. Victims included the civil governors of all four Galician provinces; Juana Capdevielle, the wife of the governor of A Coru\u00f1a; mayors such as \u00c1nxel Casal of Santiago de Compostela, of the Partido Galeguista; prominent socialists such as Jaime Quintanilla in Ferrol and Emilio Mart\u00ednez Garrido in Vigo; Popular Front deputies Antonio Bilbat\u00faa, Jos\u00e9 Mi\u00f1ones, D\u00edaz Villamil, Ignacio Seoane, and former deputy Heraclio Botana); soldiers who had not joined the rebellion, such as Generals Rogelio Caridad Pita and Enrique Salcedo Molinuevo and Admiral <a3_0>Antonio Azarola<a3_0/>; and the founders of the PG, Alexandre B\u00f3veda and V\u00edctor Casas, as well as other professionals akin to republicans and nationalists, as the journalist <a2_0>Manuel Lustres Rivas<a2_0/> or physician Luis Poza Pastrana. Many others were forced to escape into exile, or were victims of other reprisals and removed from their jobs and positions."}
