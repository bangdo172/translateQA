The Galician horse is native to the region, as is the <a0_0>Galician Blond<a0_0/> cow and the domestic fowl known as the <a1_0>gali\u00f1a de Mos<a1_0/>. The latter is an endangered species, although it is showing signs of a comeback since 2001. Galicia's woodlands and mountains are home to rabbits, hares, wild boars, and roe deer, all of which are popular with hunters. Several important bird migration routes pass through Galicia, and some of the community's relatively few environmentally protected areas are Special Protection Areas (such as on the <a2_0>R\u00eda de Ribadeo<a2_0/>) for these birds. From a domestic point of view, Galicia has been credited for author Manuel Rivas as the \"land of one million cows\". Galician Blond and Holstein cattle coexist on meadows and farms."}
