The coastal areas are mostly an alternate series of r\u00edas (submerged valleys where the sea penetrates tens of kilometres inland) and cliffs. The climate of Galicia is temperate and rainy, but it is also markedly drier in the summer, being usually classified as Oceanic in the west and north, and Mediterranean in the southeast. Its topographic and climatic conditions have made <a1_0>animal husbandry and farming<a1_0/> the primary source of Galicia's wealth for most of its history. With the exception of shipbuilding and food processing, Galicia was largely a semi-subsistence farming and fishing economy and did not experience significant industrialization until after the mid-20th century. In 2012, the gross domestic product at purchasing power parity was \u20ac56,000 million, with a nominal GDP per capita of \u20ac20,700. The population is largely concentrated in two coastal areas: from <a2_0>Ferrol to A Coru\u00f1a<a2_0/> in the northwest and from Pontevedra to Vigo in the southwest. To a lesser extent, there are smaller populations around the interior cities of Lugo, Ourense and Santiago de Compostela. The political capital is <a3_0>Santiago de Compostela<a3_0/>, in the province of <a4_0>A Coru\u00f1a<a4_0/>. Vigo, in the province of Pontevedra, is the most populous municipality with 294,997 (2014), while A Coru\u00f1a is the most populous city with 215.227 (2014)."}
