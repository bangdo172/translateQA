Fraga was associated with the <a1_0>Partido Popular<a1_0/> ('People's Party', Spain's main national conservative party) since its founding. In 2002, when the oil tanker <a2_0>Prestige<a2_0/> sank and covered the Galician coast in oil, Fraga was accused by the grassroots movement Nunca Mais (\"Never again\") of having been unwilling to react. In the 2005 Galician elections, the 'People's Party' lost its absolute majority, though remaining (barely) the largest party in the parliament, with 43% of the total votes. As a result, power passed to a coalition of the Partido dos Socialistas de Galicia (PSdeG) ('Galician Socialists' Party'), a federal sister-party of Spain's main social-democratic party, the Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (PSOE, 'Spanish Socialist Workers Party') and the nationalist Bloque Nacionalista Galego (BNG). As the senior partner in the new coalition, the PSdeG nominated its leader, Emilio Perez Touri\u00f1o, to serve as Galicia's new president, with <a3_0>Anxo Quintana<a3_0/>, the leader of BNG, as its vice president."}
