Its progress towards the Iberian Peninsula forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (foedus) by which the <a1_0>Suebi<a1_0/> would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a Briton colony and bishopric (see Mailoc) was established in Northern Galicia (<a2_0>Britonia<a2_0/>), probably as foederati and allies of the Suebi. In <a4_0>585<a4_0/>, the Visigothic King <a3_0>Leovigild<a3_0/> invaded the Suebic kingdom of Galicia and defeated it, bringing it under Visigoth control."}
