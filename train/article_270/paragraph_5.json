The earliest culture to have left significant architectural traces is the <a2_0>Megalithic<a2_0/> culture which expanded along the western European coasts during the Neolithic and Calcolithic eras. Thousands of Megalithic tumuli are distributed throughout the country, but mostly along the coastal areas. Within each tumulus is a stone burial chamber known locally as anta (dolmen), frequently preceded by a corridor. Galicia was later fully affected by the Bell Beaker culture. While its rich mineral deposits - <a3_0>tin and gold<a3_0/> - led to the development of Bronze Age metallurgy, and to the commerce of bronze and gold items all along the Atlantic fa\u00e7ade of Western Europe, where a common elite's culture evolved during the Atlantic Bronze Age."}
