The most famous assaults were upon the city of <a0_0>Vigo<a0_0/> by Sir Francis Drake in 1585 and 1589, and the siege of A Coru\u00f1a in 1589 by the English Armada. Galicia also suffered occasional slave raids by <a1_0>Barbary pirates<a1_0/>, but not as frequently as the Mediterranean coastal areas. The most famous Barbary attack was the bloody sack of the town of Cangas in 1617. At the time, the king's petitions for money and troops became more frequent, due to the human and economic exhaustion of Castile; the Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia (the local Cortes or representative assembly) was initially receptive to these petitions, raising large sums, accepting the conscription of the men of the kingdom, and even commissioning a new naval squadron which was sustained with the incomes of the Kingdom."}
