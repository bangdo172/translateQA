According to a 2001 census, 99.16 percent of the populace of Galicia understand the language, <a0_0>91<a0_0/>.04 percent speak it, <a1_0>68<a1_0/>.65 percent read it and <a2_0>57<a2_0/>.64 percent write it. The first two numbers (understanding and speaking) remain roughly the same as a decade earlier; the latter two (reading and writing) both show enormous gains: a decade earlier, only 49.3 percent of the population could read Galician, and only 34.85 percent could write it. This fact can be easily explained because of the impossibility of teaching Galician during the Francisco Franco era, so older people speak the language but have no written competence. Galician is the highest-percentage spoken language in its region among the regional languages of Spain."}
