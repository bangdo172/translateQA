According to this definition, two varieties are considered dialects of the same language if (under at least some circumstances) they would defer to the same authority regarding some questions about their language. For instance, to learn the name of a new invention, or an obscure foreign species of plant, speakers of Bavarian German and <a1_0>East Franconian German<a1_0/> might each consult a German dictionary or ask a German-speaking expert in the subject.
