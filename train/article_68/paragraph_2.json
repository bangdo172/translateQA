In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a \"dialect,\" as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of social or political status, official status, predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Meanwhile, the \"dialects\" <a1_0>subordinate to the standard language<a1_0/> are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often related) languages in and of themselves. For example, most of the various regional <b9_0>Romance languages<b9_0/> of <a2_0>Italy<a2_0/>, often colloquially referred to as Italian \"dialects,\" are, in fact, not actually derived from modern standard Italian, but rather evolved from Vulgar <a4_0>Latin<a4_0/> separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now Italy. These various Latin-derived regional languages are therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly \"dialects\" of the standard Italian language, but are instead better defined as their own separate languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard <b6_0>Italian<b6_0/> throughout Italy in the 20th century, various regional versions or varieties of standard Italian developed, generally as a mix of the national standard Italian with local regional languages and local accents. These variations on <b5_0>standard Italian<b5_0/>, known as <a3_0><b7_0><b8_0>regional Italian<b8_0/><b7_0/><a3_0/>, would more appropriately be called \"dialects\" in accordance with the first linguistic definition of \"dialect,\" as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian.
