Dante's Florentine-Tuscan literary Italian thus became the language of the literate and <a3_0>upper class<a3_0/> in Italy, and it spread throughout the peninsula as the lingua franca among the Italian educated class as well as Italian traveling merchants. The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of <a4_0>Tuscany<a4_0/> in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful, though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people."}
