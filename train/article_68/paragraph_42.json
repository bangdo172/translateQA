Italian \"<a0_0><b8_0>avere<b8_0/><a0_0/>\" and \"<b7_0>es<a4_0>sere<b7_0/><a4_0/>\" as auxiliaries for forming compound tenses are used similarly to French \"avoir\" and \"<a1_0><b9_0>\u00eatre<b9_0/><a1_0/>\". Spanish only retains \"haber\" and has done away with \"ser\" in forming compound tenses. However, when it comes to phonological structures, <a2_0><b6_0>Italian and Spanish<b6_0/><a2_0/> have undergone less change than French, with the result that some native speakers of Italian and Spanish may attain a degree of mutual comprehension that permits extensive communication.[citation needed]"}
