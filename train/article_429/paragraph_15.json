J. Rummel, genocide has 3 different meanings. The ordinary meaning is <a0_0><b5_0>murder by government<b5_0/><a0_0/> of people due to their national, ethnic, racial, or <a1_0><b6_0>religious group<b6_0/><a1_0/> membership. The legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty, the <a2_0><b7_0>Convention on the Prevention and Punishment<b7_0/> of the Crime of Genocide<a2_0/>. This also includes non-killings that in the end <a3_0><b8_0>eliminate the group<b8_0/><a3_0/>, such as <a4_0><b9_0>preventing births<b9_0/><a4_0/> or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group. A generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. It is to avoid confusion regarding what meaning is intended that Rummel created the term democide for the third meaning."}
