For example, <a2_0><b7_0>Frank Chalk<b7_0/><a2_0/> and Kurt Jonassohn studied the whole of human history, while Leo Kuper and <a3_0><b8_0>R. J. Rummel<b8_0/><a3_0/> in their more recent works concentrated on the 20th century, and Helen Fein, Barbara Harff and <a4_0><b9_0>Ted Gurr<b9_0/><a4_0/> have looked at post World War II events. Jonassohn and Bj\u00f6rnson are critical of some of these studies, arguing that they are too expansive, and conclude that the academic discipline of genocide studies is too young to have a canon of work on which to build an academic paradigm."}
