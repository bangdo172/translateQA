In genocides, the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal characteristics, i.e., ethnicity, religion or <a3_0><b8_0>nationality<b8_0/><a3_0/>. In <b7_0>politicides<b7_0/> the victim groups are defined primarily in terms of their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups. Daniel D. Polsby and Don B. Kates, Jr. state that \"... we follow Harff's distinction between genocides and '<a4_0><b9_0>pogroms<b9_0/><a4_0/>,' which she describes as 'short-lived outbursts by mobs, which, although often condoned by authorities, rarely persist.' If the violence persists for long enough, however, Harff argues, the distinction between condonation and complicity collapses.\""}
