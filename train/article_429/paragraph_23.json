The ongoing conflict in Darfur, Sudan, which started in 2003, was declared a \"genocide\" by United States Secretary of State <a1_0><b6_0>Colin Powell<b6_0/><a1_0/> on 9 September 2004 in testimony before <a2_0>the <b7_0>Senate Foreign Relations Committee<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Since that time however, no other permanent member of the UN Security Council followed suit. In fact, in January 2005, <a3_0><b8_0>an International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur<b8_0/><a3_0/>, authorized by UN Security Council Resolution 1564 of 2004, issued a report to the Secretary-General stating that \"the Government of the Sudan has not pursued a policy of genocide.\" Nevertheless, the Commission cautioned that \"The conclusion that no <a4_0><b9_0>genocidal policy<b9_0/><a4_0/> has been pursued and implemented in Darfur by the Government authorities, directly or through the militias under their control, should not be taken in any way as detracting from the gravity of the crimes perpetrated in that region. International offences such as the crimes against humanity and war crimes that have been committed in Darfur may be no less serious and heinous than genocide.\""}
