Alsatians played an active role in the French Revolution. On 21 July 1789, after receiving news of the Storming of the Bastille in Paris, a crowd of people stormed the Strasbourg city hall, forcing the city administrators to flee and putting symbolically an end to the feudal system in Alsace. In 1792, Rouget de Lisle composed in Strasbourg the Revolutionary marching song \"La Marseillaise\" (as Marching song for the Army of the Rhine), which later became the anthem of France. \"<a1_0><b4_0>La Marseillaise<b4_0/><a1_0/>\" was played for the first time in April of that year in front of the mayor of Strasbourg <b5_0>Philippe-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Dietrich<b5_0/>.
