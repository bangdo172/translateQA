This word was included into the French language as choucroute. To make it, the cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt and juniper and left to ferment in <b7_0>wooden barrels<b7_0/>. Sauerkraut can be served with <a1_0><b5_0>poultry, pork, sausage or even fish<b5_0/><a1_0/>.

Served alongside are often roasted or steamed potatoes or dumplings."}
