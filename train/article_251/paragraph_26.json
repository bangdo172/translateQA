The line plans to link up the interchange of <a3_0><b5_0>H\u0153rdt<b5_0/> to the north of Strasbourg, with Innenheim in the southwest<a3_0/>. The opening is envisaged at the end of 2011, with an average usage of <b8_0>41,000<b8_0/> vehicles a day. Estimates of the French Works Commissioner however, raised some doubts over the interest of such a project, since it would pick up only about <b7_0>10%<b7_0/> of the traffic of the A35 at Strasbourg. Paradoxically, this reversed the situation of the 1950s.
