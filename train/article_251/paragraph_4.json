During the next century, France was to be militarily shattered by <a2_0>the Hundred Years' War<a2_0/>, which prevented for a time any further tendencies in this direction. After the conclusion of the war, France was again free to pursue its desire to reach the Rhine and in <a3_0><b8_0>1444<b8_0/><a3_0/> a French army appeared in Lorraine and Alsace. It took up winter quarters, demanded the submission of Metz and Strasbourg and launched an attack on Basel."}
