They were highly segregated and subject to long-standing anti-Jewish regulations. They maintained their own customs, Yiddish language, and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos; they adhered to Talmudic law enforced by their rabbis.

They financed about a third of the mortgages in Alsace. Official tolerance grew during the French Revolution, with <a2_0>full emancipation<a2_0/> in 1791. However, local antisemitism also increased and <b4_0>Napoleon<b4_0/> turned hostile in 1806, imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews.[citation needed] In the 1830-1870 era most Jews moved to the cities, where they integrated and acculturated, as antisemitism sharply declined. By 1831, the state began paying salaries to official rabbis, and in 1846 a special legal oath for Jews was discontinued. Antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred, especially during the Revolution of 1848. Merger of Alsace into <a3_0><b7_0>Germany<b7_0/><a3_0/> in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence."}
