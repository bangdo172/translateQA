The authentic historical flag is <b7_0>the <a0_0>Rot-un-Wiss<b7_0/><a0_0/> ; Red and White are commonly found on the coat of arms of Alsacian cities <b5_0>(Strasbourg, Mulhouse<b5_0/>, S\u00e9lestat...) and of many Swiss cites, especially in Basel's region. The German region Hesse uses a flag similar to the Rot-un-Wiss. As it underlines the Germanic roots of the region, it was replaced in <b8_0>1949<b8_0/> by a new \"<a1_0>Union jack-like\" flag<a1_0/> representing <a2_0>the union of the two d\u00e9prtements<a2_0/>. It has, however, no real historical relevance. It has been since replaced again by a slightly different one, also representing the two d\u00e9partements. With the purpose of \"Frenchizing\" the region, the Rot-un-Wiss has not been recognized by <a3_0><b6_0>Paris<b6_0/><a3_0/>. Some overzealous statesmen have called it a Nazi invention - while its origins date back to the XIth century and the Red and White banner of <b4_0>G\u00e9rard de Lorraine<b4_0/> (aka. d'Alsace). The Rot-un-Wiss flag is still known as the real historical emblem of the region by most of the population and the departments' parliaments and has been widely used during protests against the creation of a new \"super-region\" gathering Champagne-Ardennes, Lorraine and Alsace, namely on Colmar's statue of liberty."}
