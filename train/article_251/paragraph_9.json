Many of the residents of the Sundgau made \"pilgrimages\" to places like <b4_0>Mariastein Abbey,<b4_0/> near Basel, in Switzerland, for baptisms and weddings. When the French Revolutionary Army of the Rhine was victorious, <b7_0>tens of thousands<b7_0/> fled east before it. When they were later permitted to return (in some cases not until <b5_0>1799<b5_0/>), it was often to find that their <a1_0>lands and homes had been confiscated<a1_0/>. These conditions led to emigration by hundreds of families to newly vacant lands in the Russian Empire in 1803\u20134 and again in <b6_0>1808<b6_0/>. A poignant retelling of this event based on what Goethe had personally witnessed can be found in his long poem <a2_0>Hermann and Dorothea<a2_0/>."}
