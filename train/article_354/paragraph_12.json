This involves a third rail which is flush with the surface like the tops of the running rails. The circuit is divided into segments with each segment energized in turn by sensors from the car as it passes over it, the remainder of the third rail remaining \"dead\". Since each <a2_0>energized segment<a2_0/> is completely covered by the lengthy articulated cars, and goes dead before being \"uncovered\" by the passage of the vehicle, there is <a3_0>no danger<a3_0/> to pedestrians. This system has also been adopted in some sections of the new tram systems in Reims, France (opened <b6_0>2011<b6_0/>) and Angers, France (also opened <b7_0>2011<b7_0/>). Proposals are in place for a number of other new services including Dubai, UAE; Barcelona, Spain; Florence, Italy; Marseille, France; Gold Coast, Australia; Washington, D.C., U.S.A.; Bras\u00edlia, Brazil and Tours, France."}
