At the same voltage, <a0_0>DC<a0_0/> often has less loss than <a1_0>AC<a1_0/>, and for this reason <b6_0>high-voltage direct current<b6_0/> is already used on some bulk power transmission lines. DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC, and on a railway this also reduces interference with <a2_0>signalling and communications<a2_0/> and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks. DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC. Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single ungrounded <b7_0>wire<b7_0/>. <b8_0>Constant power with <a3_0>AC<b8_0/><a3_0/> requires three-phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires. Another important consideration is that mains-frequency 3-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads. Parts of the system are supplied from different phases on the assumption that the total loads of the 3 phases will even out. At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases, long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time. A <b9_0>few<b9_0/> railroads have tried 3-phase but its substantial complexity has made single-phase standard practice despite the interruption in power flow that occurs twice every cycle. An experimental 6 kV DC railway was built in <a4_0>the Soviet Union<a4_0/>."}
