These motors may either be <a0_0>DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors<a0_0/> which require further <b5_0>conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC<b5_0/> (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: <a1_0>converting and transporting<a1_0/> high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? Both <b6_0>the transmission and conversion of electric energy<b6_0/> involve losses: <a2_0>ohmic losses<a2_0/> in wires and power electronics, <a3_0>magnetic field losses<a3_0/> in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a <b7_0>railway substation<b7_0/> where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be <b8_0>accounted for<b8_0/>."}
