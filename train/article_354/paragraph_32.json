Partly due to inefficient generation of electricity in the USSR (only 20.8% thermal efficiency in 1950 vs. 36.2% in 1975), in <b6_0><b9_0>1950<b9_0/><b6_0/> diesel traction was about twice as energy efficient as electric traction (in terms of net tonne-km of freight per kg of fuel). But as efficiency of electricity generation (and thus of electric traction) improved, by about <a1_0>1965<a1_0/> electric railways became more efficient than diesel. After the mid <b7_0>1970s<b7_0/> electrics used about <a2_0>25% less fuel per ton-km<a2_0/>. However diesels were mainly used on single track lines with a fair amount of traffic  so that the lower fuel consumption of electrics may be in part due to <a3_0>better operating conditions on electrified lines<a3_0/> (such as double tracking) rather than inherent energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the cost of diesel fuel was about <a4_0>1.5 times more (per unit of heat energy content<a4_0/>) than <b8_0>that of the fuel used in electric power plants<b8_0/> (that generated electricity), thus making electric railways even more energy-cost effective."}
