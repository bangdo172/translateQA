Since energy-intensity is the inverse of energy-efficiency it drops as <b9_0>efficiency<b9_0/> goes up. But most of this 43% decrease in energy-intensity also benefited diesel traction. The conversion of wheel bearings from plain to roller, increase of train weight, converting single track lines to double track (or partially double track), and the elimination of obsolete <a1_0>2-axle freight cars<a1_0/> increased the energy-efficiency of all types of traction: <a2_0>electric<a2_0/>, diesel, and steam. However, there remained a 12\u201315% reduction of energy-intensity that only benefited electric traction (and not diesel). This was due to improvements in locomotives, more widespread use of <b5_0>regenerative<b5_0/> braking (which in 1989 recycled <a3_0>2.65%<a3_0/> of the electric energy used for traction,) remote control of substations, better handling of the locomotive by the locomotive crew, and improvements in automation. Thus the overall efficiency of electric traction as compared to diesel more than doubled between <b6_0>1950 and the mid-1970s<b6_0/> in <b7_0>the Soviet Union<b7_0/>. But after <b8_0>1974<b8_0/> (thru 1980) there was <a4_0>no improvement<a4_0/> in energy-intensity (wh/tonne-km) in part due to increasing speeds of passenger and freight trains."}
