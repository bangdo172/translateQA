Since the tyres do not conduct the return current, the <a1_0>two guide rails<a1_0/> provided outside the running 'roadways' double up as conductor rails, so at least electrically it is a four-rail scheme. One of the guide rails is bonded to the return conventional running rails situated inside the roadway so <a2_0>a single polarity supply<a2_0/> is required. The trains are designed to operate from either polarity of supply, because some lines use <a3_0>reversing loops<a3_0/> at one end, causing the train to be reversed during every complete journey. The loop was originally provided to save the original steam locomotives <a4_0>having to 'run around' the rest of the train<a4_0/> saving much time. Today, the driver does not have to change ends at termini provided with such a loop, but the time saving is not so significant as it takes almost as long to drive round the loop as it does to change ends. Many of the original loops have been lost as <b7_0>lines were extended<b7_0/>."}
