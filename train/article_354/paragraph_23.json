The locomotives carried a <a2_0>four-pole rotating phase converter<a2_0/> feeding <b7_0>a single traction motor<b7_0/> of the polyphase induction type at 600 to 1,100 V. The number of poles on the 2,500 hp <a3_0>motor could be changed using <b5_0>slip rings<b5_0/><a3_0/> to run at one of four synchronous speeds. The tests were a success so, from 1932 until the 1960s, trains on the Budapest-Hegyeshalom line (towards Vienna) regularly used the same system.
