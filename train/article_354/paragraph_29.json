This can cause <b4_0>electrification of certain connections<b4_0/> to be very expensive simply because of <a1_0>the implications on the sections it is connecting<a1_0/>. <b8_0>Many<b8_0/> lines have come <a2_0>to be overlaid with multiple electrification standards<a2_0/> for different trains to avoid having to replace the existing rolling stock on those lines. Obviously, this requires that the economics of a particular connection must be more compelling and this has prevented complete electrification of many lines.
