This scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause <a1_0><b6_0>electrolytic damage<a1_0/> and even arcing<b6_0/> if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because <b7_0>the return current<b7_0/> also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the <a2_0>water and gas mains<a2_0/>. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although <b8_0>the supply<b8_0/> has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived <a3_0>by using resistors<a3_0/> which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating <a4_0>ceramic chairs<a4_0/> to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for <b9_0>running rails<b9_0/> which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails."}
