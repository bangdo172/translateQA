SEPTA's 25 Hz traction power system uses the same <a1_0>12 kV voltage<a1_0/> on the catenary in Northeast Philadelphia. This allows for the trains to operate on both the Amtrak and SEPTA power systems. Apart from having an identical <a2_0>catenary voltage<a2_0/>, the power distribution systems of Amtrak and SEPTA are very different. The Amtrak power distribution system has a 138 kV transmission network that provides power to substations which then transform the voltage to 12 kV to feed the catenary system. <b6_0><b8_0>The SEPTA power distribution system<b8_0/><b6_0/> uses a 2:1 ratio autotransformer system, with the catenary fed at 12 kV and a return feeder wire fed at 24 kV. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad used an 11 kV system between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut which was converted to 12.5 kV 60 Hz in <a3_0><b7_0>1987<b7_0/><a3_0/>."}
