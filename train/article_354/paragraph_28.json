This is mostly an issue for <a2_0>long distance trips<a2_0/>, but many lines come to be dominated by through traffic from long-haul freight trains (usually running coal, ore, or containers to or from ports). In theory, these trains could enjoy dramatic savings through electrification, but it can be too costly to extend <a3_0>electrification to isolated areas<a3_0/>, and unless an entire network is electrified, companies often find that they need to continue use of <a4_0><b9_0>diesel<b9_0/> trains<a4_0/> even if sections are electrified. The increasing demand for container traffic which is more efficient when utilizing the double-stack car also has network effect issues with existing electrifications due to insufficient clearance of overhead electrical lines for these trains, but electrification can be built or modified to have sufficient clearance, at additional cost."}
