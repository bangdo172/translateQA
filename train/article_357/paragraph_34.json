The criticism of his leadership extended far beyond the Air Council, and the Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, and Churchill themselves intimated their support was <a1_0>waning<a1_0/>. While the failure of night defence preparation was undeniable, it was not the AOC's responsibility to accrue resources. The general neglect of the RAF until the late spurt in 1938 had left <a2_0>sparse resources to build defences<a2_0/>. While it was permissible to disagree with Dowding's operational and tactical deployment of forces, the failure of the Government and Air Ministry to allot resources was ultimately the responsibility of the civil and military institutions at large. In the pre-war period, the <a3_0>Chamberlain Government<a3_0/> stated that night defence from air attack should not take up much of the national effort and, along with the Air Ministry, did not make it a priority."}
