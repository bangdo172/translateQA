Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3, was ordered to dispatch <a2_0>250<a2_0/> sorties per night including 100 against the West Midlands. Seeschlange would be carried out by Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps) which concentrated on <a3_0>mining operations against shipping<a3_0/>. It also took part in the bombing over Britain. By 19/20 April 1941, it had dropped <a4_0>3,984 mines<a4_0/>, \u2153 of the total dropped. The mines' ability to destroy entire streets earned them respect in Britain, but several fell unexploded into British hands allowing counter-measures to be developed which damaged the German anti-shipping campaign."}
