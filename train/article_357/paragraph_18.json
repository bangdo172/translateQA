However, the use of <a2_0>delayed-action bombs<a2_0/>, while initially very effective, gradually had less impact, partly because they failed to detonate.[c] Moreover, the British had anticipated the change in strategy and <a3_0>dispersed its production facilities<a3_0/> making them less vulnerable to a concentrated attack. <a4_0>Regional commissioners<a4_0/> were given plenipotentiary powers to restore communications and organise the distribution of supplies to keep the war economy moving."}
