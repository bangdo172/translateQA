The <a2_0>Meacon<a2_0/> system involved separate locations for a receiver with a directional aerial and a transmitter. The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter, the signal to be repeated. The action did not guarantee automatic success. If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the Meacon then the former signal would come through the <a3_0>stronger on the direction finder<a3_0/>. The reverse would apply only if the meacon were closer."}
