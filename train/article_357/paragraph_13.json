British fighter aircraft production continued at a rate surpassing Germany's by <a1_0>2 to 1<a1_0/>. The British produced <a2_0>10,000<a2_0/> aircraft in 1940, in comparison to Germany's 8,000. The replacement of pilots and aircrew was more difficult. Both the RAF and Luftwaffe struggled to replace manpower losses, though the Germans had larger reserves of trained aircrew. The circumstances affected the Germans more than the British. Operating over home territory, British flyers could fly again if they survived being shot down. German crews, even if they survived, faced <a3_0>capture<a3_0/>. Moreover, bombers had <a4_0>four to five crewmen<a4_0/> on board, representing a greater loss of manpower. On 7 September, the Germans shifted away from the destruction of the RAF's supporting structures. German intelligence suggested Fighter Command was weakening, and an attack on London would force it into a final battle of annihilation while compelling the British Government to surrender."}
