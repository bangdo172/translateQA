This led to G\u00f6ring and Jeschonnek agreeing to Hitler's Directive 23, <a0_0>Directions for operations against the British War Economy<a0_0/>, which was published on 6 February 1941 and gave <a1_0>aerial interdiction of British imports by sea<a1_0/> top priority. This strategy had been recognised before the war, but <a2_0>Operation Eagle Attack and the following Battle of Britain<a2_0/> had got in the way of striking at Britain's sea communications and diverted German air strength to the campaign against the RAF and its supporting structures. The OKL had always regarded the interdiction of sea communications of less importance than <a3_0>bombing land-based aircraft industries<a3_0/>."}
