The difference this made to the effectiveness of air defences is questionable. The British were still <a1_0>one-third<a1_0/> below the establishment of heavy anti-aircraft artillery AAA (or ack-ack) in May 1941, with only 2,631 weapons available. <a2_0>Dowding<a2_0/> had to rely on night fighters. From 1940 to 1941, the most successful night-fighter was the <a3_0>Boulton Paul Defiant<a3_0/>; its four squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type. AA defences improved <a4_0>by better use of radar and searchlights<a4_0/>. Over several months, the 20,000 shells spent per raider shot down in September 1940, was reduced to 4,087 in January 1941 and to 2,963 shells in February 1941."}
