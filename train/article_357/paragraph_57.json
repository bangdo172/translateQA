Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with <a1_0>87 pilots<a1_0/>, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by <a2_0>six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters<a2_0/>. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to <a3_0>204 and 74<a3_0/> in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1%. If a vigilant bomber crew could <a4_0>spot the fighter first<a4_0/>, they had a decent chance at evading it."}
