Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids; but <a1_0>by the second week<a1_0/> of heavy bombing the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened. Each day orderly lines of people queued until 4 pm, when they were allowed to enter the stations. In mid-September 1940 about <a2_0>150,000 a night<a2_0/> slept in the Underground, although by the winter and spring months the numbers had declined to 100,000 or less.
