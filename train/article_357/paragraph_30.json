Many civilians who were unwilling or unable to join the military became members of the Home Guard, the <a0_0>Air Raid Precautions<a0_0/> service (ARP), the Auxiliary Fire Service, and many other organisations. The AFS had <a1_0>138,000<a1_0/> personnel by July 1939. Only one year earlier, there had only been 6,600 full-time and 13,800 part-time firemen in the entire country. During the Blitz, The <a2_0>Scout Association<a2_0/> guided fire engines to where they were most needed, and became known as the \"Blitz Scouts\". Many unemployed were drafted into the Royal Army Pay Corps. These personnel, along with others from the <a3_0>Pioneer Corps<a3_0/>, were charged with the task of salvage and clean-up."}
