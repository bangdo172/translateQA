Civilians left for more remote areas of the country. Upsurges in population <a1_0>south Wales and Gloucester<a1_0/> intimated where these displaced people went. Other reasons, including <a2_0>industry dispersal may have been a factor<a2_0/>. However, resentment of rich self-evacuees or hostile treatment of poor ones were signs of persistence of class resentments although these factors did not appear to threaten social order. The total number of evacuees numbered <a3_0>1.4 million<a3_0/>, including a high proportion from the poorest inner-city families. Reception committees were completely unprepared for the condition of some of the children. Far from displaying the nation's unity in time of war, the scheme backfired, often aggravating class antagonism and bolstering prejudice about the urban poor. Within four months, <a4_0>88% of evacuated mothers, 86% of small children, and 43% of school children<a4_0/> had been returned home. The lack of bombing in the Phoney War contributed significantly to the return of people to the cities, but class conflict was not eased a year later when evacuation operations had to be put into effect again."}
