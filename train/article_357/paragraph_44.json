The fake fires could only begin when the bombing started over an adjacent target and its effects were brought under control. Too early and the chances of success receded; too late and the real conflagration at the target would exceed the diversionary fires. Another innovation was the <a1_0>boiler<a1_0/> fire. These units were fed from two adjacent tanks containing oil and water. The oil-fed fires were then injected with <a2_0>water<a2_0/> from time to time; the flashes produced were similar to those of the <a3_0>German C-250 and C-500 Flammbomben<a3_0/>. The hope was that, if it could <a4_0>deceive German bombardiers<a4_0/>, it would draw more bombers away from the real target."}
