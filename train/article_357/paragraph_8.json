This fact had important implications. It showed the extent to which Hitler personally mistook Allied strategy for one of morale breaking instead of one of economic warfare, with the collapse of morale as an additional bonus. Hitler was much more attracted to the political aspects of bombing. As the mere threat of it had produced diplomatic results in the 1930s, he expected that the threat of German retaliation would persuade the Allies to adopt a <a1_0>policy of moderation<a1_0/> and not to begin a policy of unrestricted bombing. His hope was \u2014 for reasons of <a2_0>political<a2_0/> prestige within Germany itself \u2014 that the German population would be protected from the Allied bombings. When this proved impossible, he began to fear that popular feeling would turn against his regime, and he redoubled efforts to mount a similar \"terror offensive\" against Britain in order <a3_0>to produce a stalemate<a3_0/> in which both sides would hesitate to use bombing at all."}
