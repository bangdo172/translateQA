Part of the reason for this was <a1_0>inaccuracy of navigation<a1_0/>. The effectiveness of British countermeasures against Knickebein, which was designed to avoid area attacks, forced the Luftwaffe to resort to these methods. The shift from precision bombing to area attack is indicated in the <a2_0>tactical methods and weapons dropped<a2_0/>. KGr 100 increased its use of incendiaries from 13\u201328 percent. By December, this had increased to <a3_0>92 percent<a3_0/>. Use of incendiaries, which were inherently inaccurate, indicated much less care was taken to avoid civilian property close to industrial sites. Other units ceased using parachute flares and opted for explosive target markers. <a4_0>Captured German air crews<a4_0/> also indicated the homes of industrial workers were deliberately targeted."}
