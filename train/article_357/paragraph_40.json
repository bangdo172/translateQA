It was, in effect, an automatic beam-tracking system, operated through <a1_0>the bomber's autopilot<a1_0/>. The single approach beam along which the bomber tracked was monitored by a ground controller. The signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber's equipment. This way the distance the bomber travelled along the beam could be precisely verified. <a2_0>Direction-finding<a2_0/> checks also enabled the controller to keep the crew on an exact course. The crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by issue of <a3_0>a code word<a3_0/> by the <a4_0>ground controller<a4_0/>, or at the conclusion of the signal transmissions which would stop. Although its maximum usable range was similar to the previous systems, it was not unknown for specific buildings to be hit."}
