Erich Raeder\u2014commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine\u2014had long argued the Luftwaffe should <a0_0>support the German submarine force<a0_0/> (U-Bootwaffe) in the Battle of the Atlantic by attacking shipping in the Atlantic Ocean and attacking British ports. Eventually, he convinced Hitler of the need to <a1_0>attack British port facilities.<a1_0/> Hitler had been convinced by Raeder that this was the right course of action due to <a2_0>the high success rates of the U-Boat force<a2_0/> during this period of the war. Hitler correctly noted that the greatest damage to the <a3_0>British war economy<a3_0/> had been done through submarines and air attacks by small numbers of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 naval aircraft. He ordered attacks to be carried out on those targets which were also the target of the Kriegsmarine. This meant that <a4_0>British coastal centres and shipping at sea west of Ireland<a4_0/> were the prime targets."}
