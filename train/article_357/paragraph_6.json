The failure to implement his vision for the new Luftwaffe was largely attributable to his immediate successors. Ex-Army personnel <a2_0>Albert Kesselring and Hans-J\u00fcrgen Stumpff<a2_0/> are usually blamed for the turning away from strategic planning and focusing on close air support. However, it would seem the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were actually <a3_0>Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek<a3_0/>. These men were long-time professional airmen involved in <a4_0>German air services<a4_0/> since early in their careers. The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations because of pressure from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel. It was instead a mission that suited the Luftwaffe's existing approach to warfare; a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns."}
