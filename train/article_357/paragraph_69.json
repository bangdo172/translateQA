First, the <a0_0>difficulty in estimating the impact of bombing upon war production<a0_0/> was becoming apparent, and second, <a1_0>the conclusion British morale was unlikely to break<a1_0/> led OKL to adopt the naval option. The indifference displayed by OKL to Directive 23 was perhaps best demonstrated in operational directives which diluted its effect. They emphasised the core strategic interest was attacking ports but they insisted in maintaining <a2_0>pressure, or diverting strength, onto industries<a2_0/> building aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and explosives. Other targets would be considered <a3_0>if the primary ones could not be attacked because of weather conditions<a3_0/>."}
