Special receivers were mounted in He 111s, with a radio mast on the bomber's fuselage. The system worked on a higher frequency (<a1_0>66\u201377 MHz<a1_0/>, compared to Knickebein's 30\u201333 MHz). Transmitters on the ground sent pulses at a rate of <a2_0>180<a2_0/> per minute. X-Ger\u00e4t received and analysed the pulses, giving the pilot both visual and aural \"on course\" signals. Three beams intersected the beam along the He 111's flight path. The first cross-beam acted as a warning for the bomb-aimer to <a3_0>start the bombing-clock<a3_0/> which he would activate only when the second cross-beam was reached. When the third cross-beam was reached the bomb aimer activated a third trigger, which stopped the first hand of the equipment's clock, with the second hand continuing. When the second hand re-aligned with the first, the bombs were released. The <a4_0>clock's timing<a4_0/> mechanism was co-ordinated with the distances of the intersecting beams from the target so the target was directly below when the bomb release occurred."}
