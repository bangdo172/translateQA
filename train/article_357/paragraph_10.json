For one thing, G\u00f6ring's fear of Hitler led him to falsify or <a1_0>misrepresent what information<a1_0/> was available in the direction of an uncritical and over-optimistic interpretation of air strength. When G\u00f6ring decided against continuing <a4_0>Wever<a4_0/>'s original heavy bomber programme in 1937, the Reichsmarschall's own explanation was that Hitler wanted to know only how many bombers there were, not how many engines each had. In July <a2_0>1939<a2_0/>, G\u00f6ring arranged a display of the Luftwaffe's most advanced equipment at <a3_0>Rechlin<a3_0/>, to give the impression the air force was more prepared for a strategic air war than was actually the case."}
