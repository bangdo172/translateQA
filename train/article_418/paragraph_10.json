A German derivatives dealer had commented to Der Spiegel that \"The <a2_0><b7_0>Maastricht<b7_0/><a2_0/> rules can be circumvented quite legally through swaps,\" and \"In previous years, Italy used a similar trick to mask its true debt with the help of a different US bank.\" These conditions had enabled Greek as well as many other European governments to spend beyond their means, while meeting the deficit targets of the European Union and the monetary union guidelines. In May 2010, the <a3_0><b8_0>Greek government deficit<b8_0/><a3_0/> was again revised and estimated to be 13.6% which was the second highest in the world relative to GDP with Iceland in first place at 15.7% and Great Britain third with 12.6%.
