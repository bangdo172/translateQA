This issue is closely linked with the issue of <a1_0>climate change<a1_0/>, as many of the anticipated health risks of <b5_0>climate change<b5_0/> are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. <a2_0><b6_0>changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources<b6_0/><a2_0/> etc.) This is because the species most likely to disappear are <a3_0><b7_0>those that buffer against infectious disease transmission<b7_0/><a3_0/>, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College, and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University."}
