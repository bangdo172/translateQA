An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by <a0_0><b4_0>Bruce A.

Wilcox's definition was \"Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...\". The <a3_0><b7_0>1992<b7_0/><a3_0/> United Nations Earth Summit defined \"biological diversity\" as \"<b8_0>the variability among living organisms from all sources<b8_0/>, including, 'inter alia', terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems\". This definition is used in the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity."}
