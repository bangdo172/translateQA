Edward O. Wilson prefers the acronym <a2_0><b7_0>HIPPO<b7_0/><a2_0/>, standing for Habitat destruction, Invasive species, Pollution, human over-Population, and Over-harvesting. The most authoritative classification in use today is <a3_0><b8_0>IUCN's Classification of Direct Threats<b8_0/><a3_0/> which has been adopted by major international conservation organizations such as the US Nature Conservancy, <a4_0><b9_0>the World Wildlife Fund<b9_0/><a4_0/>, Conservation International, and BirdLife International."}
