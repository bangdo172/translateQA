The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that \"the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago\". Of that number, <a2_0><b7_0>39%<b7_0/><a2_0/> accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, <a3_0><b8_0>39%<b8_0/><a3_0/> for the marine wildlife gone, and <a4_0><b9_0>76%<b9_0/><a4_0/> for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the biggest hit in Latin America, plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses."}
