More recently, \"Twilight Zone\" by 2 Unlimited was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series <b5_0>Tompkins Square<b5_0/>. Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is <b6_0>the theme song for <a3_0>The New Addams Family<a3_0/> series<b6_0/> on Fox Family Channel (now ABC Family). Groups such as <b7_0>Vocal Sampling and Undivided<b7_0/> emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to <a2_0>Baroque and Classical music<a2_0/>. Vocal artist Bobby McFerrin is famous for <b8_0>his instrumental emulation<b8_0/>. A cappella group Naturally Seven recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument."}
