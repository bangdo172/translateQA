In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.\" This <b4_0>a cappella behavior<b4_0/> arises from <b9_0>strict interpretation of <a2_0>Psalms 150<b9_0/><a2_0/>, which states, Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord. In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian <b5_0>musika<b5_0/> which started appearing in <b10_0>the late 17th century<b10_0/>, in what was known as <a0_0><b6_0><b11_0>khorov\u00efye kontsert\u00ef<b6_0/><a0_0/> (choral concertos)<b11_0/> made a cappella adaptations of <a1_0>Venetian-styled<a1_0/> pieces, such as the treatise, <b7_0>Grammatika musikiyskaya<b7_0/> (1675), by <a3_0><b12_0>Nikolai Diletsky<b12_0/><a3_0/>. Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as Peter Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Arkhangelsky, and Mykola Leontovych are fine examples of this."}
