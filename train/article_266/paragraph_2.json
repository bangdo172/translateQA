The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella polyphony had further developed, but gradually, the <b7_0>cantata<b7_0/> began to take the place of a cappella forms. 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be <b11_0>accompanied by <b9_0>an organ<b9_0/> \"doubling\" some or all of the voices<b11_0/>. Such is seen in the life of <b8_0>Palestrina<b8_0/> becoming a major influence on <b12_0>Bach<b12_0/>, most notably in the aforementioned <a1_0>Mass in B Minor<a1_0/>. Other composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were Claudio Monteverdi and his masterpiece, Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in <a3_0><b13_0>1610<b13_0/><a3_0/>, and <a4_0>Andrea Gabrieli<a4_0/> when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style. Learning from the preceding two composeres, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces <b14_0>in the oratorio style<b14_0/>, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and the Passion. Five of Schutz's Historien were Easter pieces, and of these the latter <a2_0>three<a2_0/>, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of Matthew, Luke and John, were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a plainchant."}
