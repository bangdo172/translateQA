Noah Porter, moral philosopher, was president from <a0_0><b5_0>1871 to 1886<b5_0/><a0_0/>. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the <a1_0><b6_0>new research university<b6_0/><a1_0/>, claiming that <a3_0>an <b8_0>eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a <a2_0><b7_0>simple-minded reactionary<b7_0/>, uncritically committed to tradition<a2_0/>, but a principled and selective conservative. He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university."}
