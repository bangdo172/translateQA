Of the New Critics, <a0_0><b5_0>Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks<b5_0/><a0_0/> were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. <a1_0><b6_0>Jacques Derrida<b6_0/><a1_0/>, the father of deconstruction, taught at the <a2_0><b7_0>Department of Comparative Literature<b7_0/><a2_0/> from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"Yale School\". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, <a3_0><b8_0>David Montgomery<b8_0/><a3_0/>, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in <a4_0><b9_0>1957<b9_0/><a4_0/>; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars."}
