W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having \"foreign-policy views born in <a0_0><b4_0>Harvard Yard's boutique<b4_0/><a0_0/>\". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis's Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \"<a1_0><b5_0>so diffuse, there isn't a symbol<b5_0/><a1_0/>, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it\" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for \"<a2_0><b6_0>liberalism and elitism<b6_0/><a2_0/>\". In 2004 Howard Dean stated, \"In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the <a3_0><b7_0><b8_0>first class to have women in it<b8_0/><b7_0/><a3_0/>; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation\"."}
