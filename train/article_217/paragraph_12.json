Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. <a0_0><b5_0>Harrison's group<b5_0/><a0_0/> is shown to have been a classic research school; <a1_0><b6_0>Pickford's and Hutchinson's<b6_0/><a1_0/> were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of <a2_0><b7_0>departmental or institutional position or power<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in <a3_0><b8_0>diverse areas of ecology<b8_0/><a3_0/> rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools.
