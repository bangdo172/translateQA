It was an important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as aes Cyprium, aes being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and Cyprium from <a1_0><b6_0>Cyprus<b6_0/><a1_0/>, where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to cuprum, hence the English copper. <a2_0><b7_0>Aphrodite<b7_0/><a2_0/> and <a3_0><b8_0>Venus<b8_0/><a3_0/> represented copper in mythology and alchemy, because of its <a4_0><b9_0>lustrous beauty<b9_0/><a4_0/>, its ancient use in producing mirrors, and its association with Cyprus, which was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper."}
