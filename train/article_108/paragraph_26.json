Bronze artifacts from the Vin\u010da culture date to <a1_0><b6_0>4500 BC<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Sumerian and Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC. The Bronze Age began in Southeastern Europe around <a2_0><b7_0>3700\u20133300 BC<b7_0/><a2_0/>, in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age, 2000\u20131000 BC in the Near East, 600 BC in Northern Europe. The transition between the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the <a3_0>Chalcolithic<a3_0/> period (copper-stone), with copper tools being used with stone tools. This term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the <b8_0>Chalcolithic<b8_0/> and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends. <a4_0>Brass<a4_0/>, an alloy of copper and <b9_0>zinc<b9_0/>, is of much more recent origin. It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire."}
