The human body contains copper at a level of about <a0_0><b5_0>1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg<b5_0/> of body mass<a0_0/>. Stated differently, the RDA for copper in normal healthy adults is quoted as 0.97 mg/day and as 3.0 mg/day. Copper is absorbed <a1_0><b6_0>in the gut<b6_0/><a1_0/>, then transported to the liver bound to <a2_0><b7_0>albumin<b7_0/><a2_0/>. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase. Copper transport here involves the protein ceruloplasmin, which carries the majority of copper in blood. <a3_0><b8_0>Ceruloplasmin<b8_0/><a3_0/> also carries copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, <a4_0><b9_0>via bile<b9_0/><a4_0/>, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine."}
