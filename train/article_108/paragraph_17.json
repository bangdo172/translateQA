This is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature mostly originates from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak for a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately <a2_0><b7_0>3.1\u00d7106 A/m2<b7_0/><a2_0/> of cross-sectional area, above which <a4_0>it begins to heat excessively<a4_0/>.
