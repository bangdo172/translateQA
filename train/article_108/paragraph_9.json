Copper plating and copper sheathing for ships' hulls was widespread; the ships of <a3_0><b8_0>Christopher Columbus<b8_0/><a3_0/> were among the earliest to have this feature. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in <a4_0><b9_0>1830<b9_0/><a4_0/> while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary copper production."}
