Copper is mostly used as a pure metal, but when a higher <a3_0><b8_0>hardness<b8_0/><a3_0/> is required it is combined with other elements to make an alloy (5% of total use) such as <a4_0><b9_0>brass<b9_0/><a4_0/> and bronze. A small part of copper supply is used in production of compounds for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Machining of copper is possible, although it is usually necessary to use an alloy for intricate parts to get good machinability characteristics."}
