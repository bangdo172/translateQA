Some <a3_0><b7_0>355<b7_0/><a3_0/> <b9_0>copper alloys<b9_0/> were proven to kill more than <a1_0>99.9%<a1_0/> of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. The United States <a2_0><b6_0>Environmental Protection Agency<b6_0/><a2_0/> (EPA) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as \"<a0_0>antimicrobial<a0_0/> materials with public health benefits,\" which allows manufacturers to legally make claims as to the positive public health benefits of products made with registered <b5_0>antimicrobial<b5_0/> copper alloys. In addition, the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys, such as bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, computer keyboards, health club equipment, shopping cart handles, etc. (for a comprehensive list of products, see: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products). Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease, and <a4_0><b8_0>Legionnaires' disease<b8_0/><a4_0/> is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems. Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U.K., Ireland, Japan, Korea, France, Denmark, and Brazil[citation needed] and in the subway transit system in Santiago, Chile, where copper-zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between 2011\u20132014."}
