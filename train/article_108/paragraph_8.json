They are very reactive towards oxygen to form <a1_0><b6_0>copper(I) oxide<b6_0/><a1_0/> and have many uses in chemistry. They are synthesized by treating copper(I) compounds with Grignard reagents, terminal alkynes or organolithium reagents; in particular, the last reaction described produces a <a2_0><b7_0>Gilman reagent<b7_0/><a2_0/>. These can undergo substitution with <a3_0>alkyl halides<a3_0/> to form coupling products; as such, they are important in the field of organic synthesis. <a4_0><b8_0>Copper(I) acetylide<b8_0/><a4_0/> is highly shock-sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling and the Sonogashira coupling. Conjugate addition to enones and carbocupration of alkynes can also be achieved with organocopper compounds. Copper(I) forms a variety of weak complexes with alkenes and carbon monoxide, especially in the presence of amine ligands."}
