These minerals are concentrated from crushed ores to the level of 10\u201315% copper by froth flotation or bioleaching. Heating this material with silica in flash smelting removes much of the <a2_0><b7_0>iron<b7_0/><a2_0/> as slag. The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into its oxides, which in turn react with the silica to form the silicate slag, which <a3_0><b8_0>floats on top<b8_0/><a3_0/> of the heated mass.
