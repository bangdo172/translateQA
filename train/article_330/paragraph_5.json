These arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy: <a1_0><b5_0>the principle of sufficient reason and the identity of indiscernibles<b5_0/><a1_0/>. The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every <a2_0>fact<a2_0/>, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise. <b6_0>The <a3_0>identity of indiscernibles<a3_0/> states<b6_0/> that if there is no way of telling two entities apart, then they are one and the same thing."}
