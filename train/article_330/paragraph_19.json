However, elsewhere Maudlin argues: \"[the] passage of time is <b6_0>an <a1_0>intrinsic<a1_0/> <a2_0>asymmetry<b6_0/><a2_0/> in the temporal structure of the world... It is the asymmetry that grounds <b7_0>the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past<b7_0/>\" [ibid, 2010 edition, p. 108]. Thus it is arguably difficult to assess whether <a3_0>Maudlin<a3_0/> is suggesting that the direction of time is a consequence of the laws or is itself primitive."}
