This principle holds that the <b6_0>rules of physics<b6_0/> must be the same for <a1_0>all observers<a1_0/>, regardless of the frame of reference that is used, and that light propagates at <a2_0>the same<a2_0/> speed in all reference frames. This theory was motivated by <a3_0>Maxwell<a3_0/>'s equations, which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the speed of light. However, <b8_0>Maxwell's equations<b8_0/> give no indication of what this speed is relative to. Prior to Einstein, it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium, called <a4_0>the luminiferous ether<a4_0/>. In contrast, the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames, and examines the implications of this postulate."}
