The subject focuses on a number of basic issues, including whether or not time and space exist independently of <a2_0>the mind<a2_0/>, whether they exist independently of one another, what accounts for <b7_0>time<b7_0/>'s apparently <a3_0>unidirectional<a3_0/> flow, whether times other than the present moment exist, and questions about the nature of identity (particularly <b6_0>the nature of identity<b6_0/> over time)."}
