The first has to do with <a1_0>coordinating units of length with certain physical objects<a1_0/>. This is motivated by the fact that <a2_0>we can never directly apprehend <b6_0>length<b6_0/><a2_0/>. Instead we must choose some physical object, say the Standard Metre at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or the wavelength of cadmium to stand in as our unit of length. The second feature deals with <a3_0>separated objects<a3_0/>. Although we can, presumably, directly test <b7_0>the equality of length<b7_0/> of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another. Even supposing that two rods, whenever brought near to one another are seen to be equal in length, we are not justified in stating that they are always equal in <b8_0>length.<b8_0/> This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects. Sameness of length, to the contrary, must be set <a4_0><b9_0>by definition<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
