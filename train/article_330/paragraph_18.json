For example, certain processes in quantum mechanics, <b4_0>relating to the <a1_0>weak nuclear force<a1_0/>,<b4_0/> are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the <b5_0>time-asymmetric phenomena<b5_0/> in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of <a2_0>macroscopic<a2_0/> time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.[citation needed]"}
