As the water begins to spin in the bucket, <b6_0>the surface of <a2_0>the <b7_0>water<b7_0/><b6_0/> will become concave<a2_0/>. If the bucket is stopped, the water will <a3_0>continue to spin<a3_0/>, and while the spin continues, <b8_0>the surface<b8_0/> will remain concave. The concave surface is apparently not the result of <a4_0>the interaction of the bucket and the water<a4_0/>, since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin, it becomes concave as the water starts to spin, and it remains concave as the bucket stops."}
