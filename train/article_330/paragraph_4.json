He describes time as an <a2_0>a priori notion<a2_0/> that, together with other a priori notions such as <a3_0>space<a3_0/>, allows us to comprehend <a4_0>sense experience<a4_0/>. <b6_0>Kant<b6_0/> denies that either space or time are <b7_0>substance<b7_0/>, entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure <b8_0>our experience<b8_0/>. Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) events. Although <b9_0>space and time<b9_0/> are held to be transcendentally ideal in this sense, they are also empirically real\u2014that is, not mere illusions."}
