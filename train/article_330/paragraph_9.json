If we were to imagine a universe that only contains a bucket, on Newton's account, this bucket could be set to spin relative to absolute space, and the water it contained would form the characteristic concave surface. But in the absence of anything else in the universe, it would be difficult to confirm <a1_0><b4_0>that the bucket was indeed spinning<b4_0/><a1_0/>. It seems equally possible that <b5_0>the surface of the water<b5_0/> in the bucket <a2_0>would remain flat."}
