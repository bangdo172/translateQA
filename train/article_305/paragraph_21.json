Then came the <a1_0>semantic theory of truth<a1_0/> formulated by the logician <a0_0>Alfred Tarski<a0_0/> and published in 1933. <b5_0>Popper<b5_0/> writes of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski's theory, to his intense joy. The theory met critical objections to truth as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it.
