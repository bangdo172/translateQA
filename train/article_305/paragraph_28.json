After <a1_0>behaviour<a1_0/> has changed radically, <b4_0>small but quick changes of the phenotype<b4_0/> follow to <b5_0>make the organism fitter to its changed goals<b5_0/>. This way it looks as if the phenotype were changing guided by some invisible hand, while it is merely natural selection working in combination with the new behaviour. For example, according to this hypothesis, <b6_0>the eating habits of the giraffe<b6_0/> must have changed before its elongated neck evolved. Popper contrasted this view as \"evolution from within\" or \"<a3_0>active<a3_0/> Darwinism\" (the organism actively trying to discover new ways of life and being on a quest for conquering new ecological niches), with the naturalistic \"<b7_0>evolution from without<b7_0/>\" (which has the picture of a hostile environment only trying to kill the mostly passive organism, or perhaps segregate some of its groups)."}
