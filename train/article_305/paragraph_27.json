According to this model, living organisms themselves have <a2_0>goals<a2_0/>, and act according to these goals, each guided by a central control. In its most sophisticated form, this is <b5_0>the brain of humans<b5_0/>, but controls also exist in much less sophisticated ways for species of lower complexity, such as the <b6_0>amoeba<b6_0/>. This control organ plays a special role in evolution\u2014it is the \"spearhead of evolution\". The goals bring the purpose into the world. <a3_0>Mutations<a3_0/> in the genes that determine the structure of the control may then cause drastic changes in <b7_0>behaviour<b7_0/>, preferences and goals, without having an impact on the organism's phenotype.
