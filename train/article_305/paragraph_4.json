His dissertation was entitled \"<b6_0>Die Methodenfrage der Denkpsychologie<b6_0/>\" (<a1_0>The question of method in cognitive psychology<a1_0/>). In <b7_0>1929<b7_0/>, he obtained the authorisation to teach <a2_0>mathematics and physics<a2_0/> in secondary school, which he started doing. He married his colleague Josefine Anna Henninger (1906\u20131985) in 1930. Fearing the rise of <a3_0>Nazism<a3_0/> and the threat of the Anschluss, he started to use the evenings and the nights to write his first book <b8_0>Die beiden Grundprobleme der Erkenntnistheorie<b8_0/> (The Two Fundamental Problems of the Theory of Knowledge). He needed to publish one to get some academic position in a country that was safe for people of Jewish descent. However, he ended up not publishing the two-volume work, but a condensed version of it with some new material, Logik der Forschung (<a4_0>The Logic of Scientific Discovery<a4_0/>), in 1934. Here, he criticised psychologism, naturalism, inductionism, and logical positivism, and put forth his theory of potential falsifiability as the criterion demarcating science from non-science. In 1935 and 1936, he took <b9_0>unpaid<b9_0/> leave to go to the United Kingdom for a study visit."}
