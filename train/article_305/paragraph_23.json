The intuitive idea behind verisimilitude is that the assertions or hypotheses of scientific theories can be objectively measured with respect to the amount of truth and falsity that they imply. And, in this way, one <b6_0>theory<b6_0/> can be evaluated as more or less true than another on a <b7_0>quantitative basis<b7_0/> which, Popper emphasises forcefully, has nothing to do with \"<a1_0>subjective<a1_0/> probabilities\" or other merely \"<a2_0>epistemic<a2_0/>\" considerations."}
