This process, <a0_0>error elimination<a0_0/> (), performs a similar function for science that <b5_0>natural selection<b5_0/> performs for biological evolution. <b6_0>Theories that better survive the process of refutation<b6_0/> are not more true, but rather, <a1_0>more \"fit\"<a1_0/>\u2014in other words, more applicable to the problem situation at hand (). Consequently, just as a species' biological fitness does not ensure continued survival, neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific theory from refutation in the future. Yet, as it appears that the engine of <b7_0>biological evolution<b7_0/> has, over many generations, produced adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival, likewise, the evolution of theories through the scientific method may, in <b8_0>Popper<b8_0/>'s view, reflect a certain type of progress: toward <a3_0>more and more interesting problems<a3_0/> (). For Popper, it is in the interplay between the tentative theories (<a2_0>conjectures<a2_0/>) and error elimination (refutation) that scientific knowledge advances toward greater and greater problems; in a process very much akin to the interplay between genetic variation and natural selection."}
