To say that a given statement (e.g., the statement of a law of some scientific theory) -- [call it \"T\"] -- is \"falsifiable\" does not mean that \"T\" is false. Rather, it means that, if \"T\" is false, then (in principle), \"T\" could be shown to be false, by observation or by experiment. Popper's account of the <b5_0><b6_0>logical asymmetry<b6_0/> between <a0_0><b4_0>verification and falsifiability<b5_0/><b4_0/><a0_0/> lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take <a1_0>falsifiability<a1_0/> as his criterion of demarcation between what is, and is not, genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it is falsifiable. This led him to attack the claims of both <a3_0>psychoanalysis<a3_0/> and contemporary <a2_0><b7_0><b8_0>Marxism<b8_0/><b7_0/><a2_0/> to scientific status, on the basis that their theories are not falsifiable."}
