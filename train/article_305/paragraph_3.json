In <a3_0><b8_0>1922<b8_0/><a3_0/>, he did his matura by way of a second chance education and finally joined the University as an ordinary student. He completed his examination as an <a4_0>elementary teacher<a4_0/> in <b9_0>1924<b9_0/> and started working at an after-school care club for socially endangered children. In <b7_0>1925<b7_0/>, he went to the newly founded P\u00e4dagogisches Institut and continued studying philosophy and psychology. Around that time he started courting Josefine Anna Henninger, who later became his wife."}
