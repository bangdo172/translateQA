Popper considered <a1_0>historicism<a1_0/> to be <b6_0>the theory that history develops inexorably<b6_0/> and necessarily according to knowable general laws towards a determinate end. He argued that this view is the principal theoretical presupposition underpinning most forms of <a2_0>authoritarianism and totalitarianism<a2_0/>. He argued that <b7_0>historicism<b7_0/> is founded upon mistaken assumptions regarding the nature of scientific law and prediction. Since <a3_0>the growth of human knowledge<a3_0/> is a causal factor in the evolution of human history, and since \"no <b8_0>society<b8_0/> can predict, scientifically, its own future states of knowledge\", it follows, he argued, that there can be no predictive science of human history. For Popper, metaphysical and historical indeterminism go hand in hand."}
