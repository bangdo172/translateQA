It was here that he wrote his influential work <b6_0>The Open Society and its Enemies<b6_0/>.

In 1946, after the Second World War, he moved to the United Kingdom to become reader in <a3_0>logic and scientific method<a3_0/> at the London School of Economics. Three years later, in 1949, he was appointed professor of logic and scientific method at the <b9_0>University of London<b9_0/>. Popper was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1958 to 1959.

In <b8_0>1985<b8_0/>, he returned to Austria so that his wife could have her relatives around her during the last months of her life; she died in <b7_0>November<b7_0/> that year. After the <a4_0>Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft<a4_0/> failed to establish him as the director of a newly founded branch researching the philosophy of science, he went back again to the United Kingdom in 1986, settling in Kenley, Surrey."}
