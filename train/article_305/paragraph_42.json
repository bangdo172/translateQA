An event that happened in <b5_0>1919<b5_0/> had a profound effect on him: During a riot, caused by the <a0_0>Communists<a0_0/>, the police shot <b7_0>several<b7_0/> unarmed people, including some of Popper's friends, when they tried to free party comrades from prison. The riot had, in fact, been part of a plan by which leaders of the Communist party with connections to <a3_0>B\u00e9la Kun<a3_0/> tried to take power by <a1_0>a coup<a1_0/>; Popper did not know about this at that time. However, he knew that the riot instigators were swayed by the Marxist doctrine that <a4_0>class struggle<a4_0/> would produce vastly more dead men than the inevitable revolution brought about as quickly as possible, and so had no scruples to put the life of the rioters at risk to achieve their selfish goal of becoming the future leaders of the working class. This was the start of his later criticism of <a2_0>historicism<a2_0/>. Popper began to reject <b8_0>Marxist historicism<b8_0/>, which he associated with questionable means, and later <b9_0>socialism<b9_0/>, which he associated with placing equality before freedom (to the possible disadvantage of equality)."}
