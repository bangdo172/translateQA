All of Karl Popper's grandparents were Jewish, but the Popper family converted to <a1_0><b6_0>Lutheranism<b6_0/><a1_0/> before Karl was born, and so he received Lutheran baptism. They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a <b7_0>lawyer<b7_0/> from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University, and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna's liberal <a2_0>Burgomaster Herr <b8_0>Gr\u00fcbl<b8_0/><a2_0/> and, after Gr\u00fcbl's death in 1898, Simon took over the business. (Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Gr\u00fcbl's first name was Raimund, after which Karl received his middle name. Popper himself, in his autobiography, erroneously recalls that Herr Gr\u00fcbl's first name was Carl.) His father was a <a4_0>bibliophile<a4_0/> who had <a3_0><b9_0>12,000\u201314,000<b9_0/><a3_0/> volumes in his personal library. Popper inherited both the library and the disposition from him."}
