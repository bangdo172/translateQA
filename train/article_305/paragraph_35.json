Also, in his collection Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (Harper & Row, 1963), Popper writes, \"Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with <a2_0><b7_0>the critical discussion of myths<b7_0/><a2_0/>, and of magical techniques and practices. The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers.

The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them.\""}
