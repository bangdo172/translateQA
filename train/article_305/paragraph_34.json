Thus we can only say that the whole package of relevant theories has been collectively falsified, but cannot conclusively say which <b5_0>element of the package<b5_0/> must be replaced. An example of this is given by the discovery of the planet <a2_0>Neptune<a2_0/>: <b6_0>when the motion of Uranus was found not to match the predictions of Newton's laws<b6_0/>, the theory \"There are seven planets in the solar system\" was rejected, and not Newton's laws themselves. Popper discussed this <b7_0>critique of na\u00efve falsificationism<b7_0/> in Chapters 3 and 4 of <a1_0>The Logic of Scientific Discovery<a1_0/>. For Popper, theories are accepted or rejected via a sort of selection process. Theories that say more about the way things appear are to be preferred over those that do not; the <a3_0>more generally applicable<a3_0/> a theory is, the greater its value. Thus Newton's laws, with their <b8_0>wide general application<b8_0/>, are to be preferred over the much more specific \"the solar system has seven planets\".[dubious \u2013 discuss]"}
