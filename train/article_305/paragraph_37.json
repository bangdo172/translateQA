These examples were pointed out by <a1_0>Carl Gustav Hempel<a1_0/>. <b4_0>Hempel<b4_0/> came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that <b6_0>falsificationism<b6_0/> was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category. For instance, <b5_0>atomic theory<b5_0/> implies that all metals melt at some temperature."}
