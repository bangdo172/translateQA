The nature of such theories made it impossible for any <a1_0><b4_0>criticism or experiment<b4_0/><a1_0/> - even in principle - to show them to be false. This realisation had an important consequence when <b5_0>Popper<b5_0/> later tackled the problem of demarcation in the philosophy of science, as it led him to posit that the strength of a scientific theory lies in its both <b6_0>being susceptible to <a0_0>falsification<b6_0/><a0_0/>, and not actually being falsified by criticism made of it. He considered that if a theory cannot, in principle, be falsified by criticism, it is not a scientific theory."}
