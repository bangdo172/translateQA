This problem arises from his position that the <a2_0><b5_0>truth content<b5_0/><a2_0/> of our theories, even the best of them, cannot be verified by scientific testing, but can only be falsified.

Some things simply do not lend themselves to being shown to be false, and therefore, are not falsifiable. If so, then how is it that the growth of science appears to result in a growth in knowledge?
