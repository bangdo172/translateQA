Lacking an <b1_0>airport<b1_0/>, the islands can be reached only by sea. Fishing boats from South Africa service the islands <b2_0>eight or nine times a year<b2_0/>. The RMS Saint Helena used to connect the main island to St Helena and South Africa once each year during its January voyage, but has done so only twice in the last few years, in 2006 and 2011. The wider territory has access to air travel with Ascension island served by RAF Ascension Island and a new airport, financed by the <b4_0>United Kingdom government<b4_0/>, under construction on St Helena and due for completion in 2016. There is however no direct, regular service to Tristan da Cunha itself from either location. The harbour at Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is called Calshot Harbour, named after the place in <b3_0>Hampshire<b3_0/> where the islanders temporarily stayed during the volcanic eruption."}
