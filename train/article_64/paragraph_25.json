Tristan da Cunha's isolation has led to an unusual, patois-like dialect of English described by the writer Simon Winchester as \"a sonorous amalgam of Home Counties lockjaw and nineteenth century idiom, Afrikaans slang and Italian.\" Bill Bryson documents some examples of the island's dialect in his book, <b4_0>The Mother Tongue<b4_0/>."}
