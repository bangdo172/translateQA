All Tristan families are farmers, owning their own stock and/or fishing. All land is communally owned. All households have plots of land at The Patches on which they grow potatoes. Livestock numbers are strictly controlled to conserve pasture and to prevent better-off families from accumulating wealth. Unless it votes for a <b3_0>change in its law<b3_0/>, no outsiders are allowed to buy land or settle on Tristan; theoretically the whole island would have to be put up for sale. All people \u2013 including children and pensioners \u2013 are involved in farming, while adults additionally have salaried jobs working either for the Government, or, a small number in domestic service, and many of the men are involved in the fishing industry, going to sea in good weather. The nominal fishing season lasts <b4_0>90<b4_0/> days; however during the 2013 fishing season \u2013 1 July through 30 September \u2013 there were only 10 days suitable for fishing."}
