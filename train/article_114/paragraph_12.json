It precedes the later and differs in its genesis and emerged focus. The movement originated in Eastern Europe (what is now Belarus and Ukraine) in the 18th century. Founded by <a2_0>Israel ben Eliezer<a2_0/>, known as the Baal Shem Tov (1698\u20131760), it emerged in an age of persecution of the Jewish people, when a schism existed between scholarly and common European Jews. In addition to bridging this class gap, <b9_0>Hasidic teachings<b9_0/> sought to reintroduce joy in the performance of the commandments and in prayer through the popularisation of Jewish mysticism (this joy had been suppressed in the intense intellectual study of the Talmud). The <a3_0><b7_0>Ba'al Shem Tov<b7_0/><a3_0/> sought to combine rigorous scholarship with more emotional mitzvah observance. In a practical sense, what distinguishes Hasidic Judaism from other forms of Haredi Judaism is the close-knit organization of Hasidic communities centered on a Rebbe (sometimes translated as \"Grand Rabbi\"), and various customs and modes of dress particular to each community. In some cases, there are religious ideological distinctions between Hasidic groups, as well. Another phenomenon that sets Hasidic Judaism apart from general Haredi Judaism is the strong emphasis placed on speaking <b8_0>Yiddish<b8_0/>; in (many) Hasidic households and communities, <a4_0>Yiddish<a4_0/> is spoken exclusively."}
