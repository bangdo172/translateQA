It is characterised by its focus on community-wide Torah study. Haredi Orthodoxy's differences with Modern Orthodoxy usually lie in interpretation of the nature of <b6_0>traditional halakhic concepts<b6_0/> and in acceptable application of these concepts. Thus, <b7_0>engaging in the commercial world<b7_0/> is a legitimate means to achieving a livelihood, but individuals should participate in <a1_0>modern society<a1_0/> as little as possible. The same outlook is applied with regard to obtaining degrees necessary to enter one's intended profession: where tolerated in the <a2_0>Haredi<a2_0/> society, attending <b8_0>secular institutions<b8_0/> of higher education is viewed as a necessary but inferior activity. Academic interest is instead to be directed toward the religious education found in the yeshiva. Both boys and <b9_0>girls<b9_0/> attend school and may proceed to higher Torah study, starting anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18. A significant proportion of students, especially boys, remain in <a3_0>yeshiva<a3_0/> until marriage (which is often arranged through facilitated dating \u2013 see shiduch), and many study in a <a4_0>kollel<a4_0/> (Torah study institute for married men) for many years after marriage. Most Orthodox men (including many Modern Orthodox), even those not in Kollel, will study Torah daily."}
