In general, Modern Orthodoxy holds that <b7_0>Jewish law is normative and binding<b7_0/>, while simultaneously attaching a positive value to interaction with contemporary society. In this view, Orthodox Judaism can \"be enriched\" by its intersection with <b8_0>modernity<b8_0/>; further, \"modern society creates opportunities to be productive citizens engaged in the <a3_0>Divine work<a3_0/> of transforming the world to benefit humanity\". At the same time, in order to preserve the integrity of <a1_0>halakha<a1_0/>, any area of \"powerful inconsistency and conflict\" between <a4_0>Torah<a4_0/> and modern culture must be avoided. Modern Orthodoxy, additionally, assigns a central role to the \"<a2_0><b9_0>People of Israel<b9_0/><a2_0/>\"."}
