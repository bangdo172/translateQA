As a general rule, Haredi Jews believe that when at all possible <b6_0>the law should be maintained<b6_0/> as it was understood by their authorities at the haskalah, believing that it had never changed. Modern Orthodox authorities are more willing to assume that <b7_0>under scrupulous examination, identical principles may lead to different applications<b7_0/> in the context of modern life. To the Orthodox Jew, <b8_0>halakha<b8_0/> is a guide, <a1_0>God's Law,<a1_0/> governing the <a4_0>structure of daily life<a4_0/> from the moment he or she wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep. It includes codes of behaviour applicable to a broad range of circumstances (and many hypothetical ones). There are though a number of halakhic meta-principles that guide the halakhic process and in an instance of opposition between a specific <b9_0>halakha and a meta-principle<b9_0/>, the meta-principle often wins out . Examples of Halakhic Meta-Principles are: \"Deracheha Darchei Noam\" - the ways of Torah are pleasant, <a2_0>\"Kavod Habriyot\"<a2_0/> - basic respect for human beings, <a3_0>\"Pikuach Nefesh\"<a3_0/> - the sanctity of human life."}
