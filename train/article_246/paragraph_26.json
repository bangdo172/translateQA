Brown's wife, Lisa, believed a Comcast employee changed the name in response to the Browns' request to cancel their cable service, an incident in which she was refused a cancellation unless she paid a $60 fee and instead was routed to a retention specialist. Comcast refused to correct the name on their bill after bringing it to the attention of numerous customer service outlets for the company by explaining that Ricardo is the legal name of the customer, so the Browns turned to consumer advocate <a1_0><b5_0>Christopher Elliott<b5_0/><a1_0/>. Elliott posted <b8_0>the facts of the incident, along with a copy of the bill<b8_0/>, on his blog. Shortly thereafter, Elliott contacted Comcast and Comcast offered the Browns an apology, a <a2_0><b7_0>$60<b7_0/><a2_0/> refund, and a <a4_0>promise to track down and fire the responsible employee<a4_0/>. The Browns instead requested a full refund for their negative experience and Comcast agreed to refund the family the last <a3_0><b9_0>two<b9_0/> years<a3_0/> of service and provide the next two years of service at no charge. Comcast released a statement explaining: \"We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change. We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again.\" "}
