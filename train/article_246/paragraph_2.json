Critics also point out <a2_0>a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast's service area<a2_0/>; there is limited competition among cable providers. Given Comcast's negotiating power as a large ISP, some suspect that Comcast could leverage paid peering agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds.
