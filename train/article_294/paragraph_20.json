The annual real GDP growth rate is <b5_0>just above <a1_0>3%<b5_0/><a1_0/>. The importance of food crops over exported cash crops is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between <a2_0>200,000 and 300,000<a2_0/> tonnes a year, while the production of <a3_0>cotton<a3_0/>, the principal exported cash crop, ranges <b6_0>from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year<b6_0/>. Food crops are not exported in large quantities, but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country, because Central Africans derive far more <b7_0>income<b7_0/> from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee.[citation needed] Much of the country is self-sufficient in food crops; however, livestock development is hindered <b8_0>by the presence of the <a4_0>tsetse fly<b8_0/><a4_0/>.[citation needed]"}
