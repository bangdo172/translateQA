The Catholic Church had long fought against heretic movements, but during the Late Middle Ages, it started to experience demands for reform from within. The first of these came from Oxford professor <a0_0><b5_0>John Wycliffe<b5_0/><a0_0/> in England.

In spite of influential supporters among the English aristocracy, such as <a4_0><b9_0>John of Gaunt<b9_0/><a4_0/>, the movement was not allowed to survive.
