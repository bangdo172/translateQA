The city itself is often called \"A\u00b2\" (\"A-squared\") or \"A2\" (\"A two\") or \"AA\", \"The Deuce\" (mainly by Chicagoans), and \"Tree Town\". With tongue-in-cheek reference to the city's liberal political leanings, some occasionally refer to Ann Arbor as \"<b6_0>The People's Republic of <a2_0>Ann Arbor<b6_0/><a2_0/>\" or \"<b4_0>25 square miles surrounded by reality<b4_0/>\", the latter phrase being adapted from Wisconsin Governor Lee Dreyfus's description of Madison, Wisconsin. In A Prairie Home Companion broadcast from Ann Arbor, Garrison Keillor described Ann Arbor as \"a city where people discuss socialism, but only in the fanciest restaurants.\" Ann Arbor sometimes appears on citation indexes as an author, instead of a location, often with the academic degree MI, <b5_0>a misunderstanding of the abbreviation for Michigan<b5_0/>. Ann Arbor has become increasingly <a1_0>gentrified<a1_0/> in recent years."}
