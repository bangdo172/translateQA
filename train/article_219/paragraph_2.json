The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the <b5_0>Michigan Central Railroad<b5_0/>, and a north\u2014south railway connecting <a1_0><b9_0>Ann Arbor<b9_0/><a1_0/> to <b6_0>Toledo<b6_0/> and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of <a2_0>British<a2_0/> ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and African-Americans. In <a3_0>1851<a3_0/>, Ann Arbor was chartered as <b7_0>a city,<b7_0/> though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann Arbor again saw robust growth, with new immigrants coming from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland. Ann Arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in milling. Ann Arbor's Jewish community also grew after the turn of the 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, <a4_0><b8_0>Beth Israel Congregation<b8_0/><a4_0/>, was established in 1916."}
