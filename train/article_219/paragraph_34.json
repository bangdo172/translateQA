Major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. The city is belted by three freeways: I-94, which runs along the <b2_0>southern portion<b2_0/> of the city; U.S. Highway 23 (US 23), which primarily runs along the <b0_0>eastern edge<b0_0/> of Ann Arbor; and M-14, which runs along the <b1_0>northern edge<b1_0/> of the city. Other nearby highways include US 12, M-17, and M-153. Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the <b3_0>west<b3_0/>, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. The city also has a system of bike routes and paths and includes the nearly complete <b4_0>Washtenaw County Border-to-Border Trail<b4_0/>."}
