In 2011, <a1_0>the military junta<a1_0/> was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election, and <a2_0>a nominally civilian government<a2_0/> was installed. While <a3_0>former military leaders still wield enormous power in the country<a3_0/>, Burmese Military have taken steps toward relinquishing control of the government. This, along with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and political prisoners, has improved the country's human rights record and foreign relations, and has led to the easing of trade and other economic sanctions. There is, however, continuing criticism of the government's treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority and its poor response to the religious clashes. In the landmark 2015 election, <a4_0>Aung San Suu Kyi's party won a majority in both houses, ending military rule."}
