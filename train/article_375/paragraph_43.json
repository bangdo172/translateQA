Since <a0_0>1985<a0_0/>, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive <a4_0>200<a4_0/> donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to <a1_0>33\u00a2 for every registered Tucson voter<a1_0/>, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are <a2_0>64\u00a2 per registered voter<a2_0/>, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as <a3_0>San Francisco and New York City<a3_0/>, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas."}
