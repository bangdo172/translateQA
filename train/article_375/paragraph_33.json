While at its heart the Fiesta is a sporting event, it includes what is billed as \"the world's largest non-mechanized parade\". The Rodeo Parade is a popular event as most schools give <a4_0>two rodeo days off<a4_0/> instead of Presidents Day. The exception to this is Presidio High (a non-public charter school), which doesn't get either. Western wear is seen throughout the city as corporate dress codes are cast aside during the Fiesta.
