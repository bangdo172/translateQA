However, at the beginning of the Iraq War, anti-war activists painted it <a3_0><a8_0>black<a8_0/><a3_0/>. This was followed by a paint scuffle where the \"A\" was painted various colors until the <a4_0>city council<a4_0/> intervened. It is now <a9_0>red, white and blue<a9_0/> except when it is white or another color decided by a biennial election. Because of the three-color paint scheme often used, the shape of the A can be vague and indistinguishable from the rest of the peak. The top of Sentinel Peak, which is accessible by road, offers an outstanding scenic view of the city looking eastward. A parking lot located near the summit of Sentinel Peak was formerly a popular place to watch sunsets or view the city lights at night."}
