While the exact origin of this nickname is uncertain, it is commonly traced back to <a0_0>Mayor R. N. \"Bob\" Leatherwood<a0_0/>. When rail service was established to the city on <a1_0>March 20, 1880<a1_0/>, Leatherwood celebrated the fact by sending telegrams to various leaders, including <a4_0>the President of the United States and the Pope<a4_0/>, announcing that the <a2_0>\"ancient and honorable pueblo\"<a2_0/> of Tucson was now connected by rail to the outside world. The term became popular with newspaper writers who often abbreviated it as <a3_0>\"A. and H. Pueblo\"<a3_0/>. This in turn transformed into the current form of \"The Old Pueblo\"."}
