Lowell Roads are the remnants of the Historic Fort Lowell. This area has become one of Tucson's iconic neighborhoods. In <a5_0>1891<a5_0/>, the Fort was abandoned and much of the interior was stripped of their useful components and it quickly fell into ruin. In <a2_0>1900<a2_0/>, three of the officer buildings were purchased for use as <a6_0>a sanitarium<a6_0/>. The sanitarium was then sold to <a0_0><a7_0>Harvey Adkins<a7_0/><a0_0/> in 1928. <a8_0>The Bolsius family Pete, Nan and Charles Bolsius<a8_0/> purchased and renovated surviving adobe buildings of the Fort \u2013 transforming them into spectacular artistic southwestern architectural examples. Their woodwork, plaster treatment and sense of proportion drew on their Dutch heritage and New Mexican experience. Other artists and academics throughout the middle of the 20th century, including: Win Ellis, Jack Maul, Madame Cheruy, Giorgio Belloli, Charels Bode, Veronica Hughart, Edward and Rosamond Spicer, Hazel Larson Archer and Ruth Brown, renovated adobes, built homes and lived in the area. The artist colony attracted writers and poets including <a3_0>beat generation<a3_0/> Alan Harrington and Jack Kerouac whose visit is documented in his iconic book <a1_0><a9_0>On the Road<a9_0/><a1_0/>. This rural pocket in the middle of the city is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Each year in <a4_0>February<a4_0/> the neighborhood celebrates its history in the City Landmark it owns and restored the San Pedro Chapel."}
