It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause flash floods. The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes. Large areas of the city do not have storm sewers, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours. A few underpasses in Tucson have \"feet of water\" scales painted on their supports to discourage fording by automobiles during a rainstorm. <a6_0>Arizona traffic code Title 28-910<a6_0/>, the so-called \"Stupid Motorist Law\", was instituted in <a0_0><a5_0>1995<a5_0/><a0_0/> to discourage people from entering flooded roadways. If the road is flooded and a barricade is in place, motorists who drive around the barricade can be charged <a7_0>up to $<a1_0>2000<a7_0/><a1_0/> for costs involved in rescuing them. Despite all warnings and precautions, however, three Tucson drivers have drowned between 2004 and 2010."}
