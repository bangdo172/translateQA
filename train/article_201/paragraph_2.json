They recorded four of their own songs, \"Liar\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", \"The Night Comes Down\" and \"Jesus\", for a demo tape; no record companies were interested. It was also around this time Freddie changed his surname to \"<a2_0>Mercury<a2_0/>\", inspired by the line \"Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me\" in the song \"<a3_0>My Fairy King<a3_0/>\". On <a4_0>2 July 1971<a4_0/>, Queen played their first show in the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey college outside London."}
