Featuring tracks such as \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\" and \"Heaven for Everyone\", it was constructed from Mercury's final recordings in 1991, material left over from their previous studio albums and re-worked material from May, Taylor, and Mercury's solo albums. The album also featured the song \"Mother Love\", the last vocal recording Mercury made prior to his death, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor and Deacon later added the instrumental track. After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he \"wasn't feeling that great\" and stated, \"I will finish it when I come back, next time\"; however, he never made it back into the studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song. Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury's death, were completed at the band's studio in <a3_0>Montreux<a3_0/>, Switzerland. The album reached No. 1 on the UK charts immediately following its release, and has sold <a1_0>20 million<a1_0/> copies worldwide. On 25 November <a2_0>1996<a2_0/>, a statue of Mercury was unveiled in Montreux overlooking Lake Geneva, almost five years to the day since his death."}
