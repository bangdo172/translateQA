Time commented with approval on his singing ability and visual similarity to Mercury. However, in July 2013, Baron Cohen dropped out of the role due to \"creative differences\" between him and the surviving band members. In December 2013, it was announced that <a1_0>Ben Whishaw<a1_0/>, best known for playing Q in the James Bond film Skyfall, had been chosen to replace Cohen in the role of Mercury. The motion picture is being written by <a2_0>Peter Morgan<a2_0/>, who had been nominated for Oscars for his screenplays The Queen and Frost/Nixon. The film, which is being co-produced by <a3_0>Robert De Niro<a3_0/>'s TriBeCa Productions, will focus on Queen's formative years and the period leading up to the celebrated performance at the <a4_0>1985<a4_0/> Live Aid concert."}
