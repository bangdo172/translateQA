The genres they have been associated with include progressive rock, symphonic rock, art rock, glam rock, hard rock, <a2_0>heavy metal<a2_0/>, pop rock, and psychedelic rock. Queen also wrote songs that were inspired by diverse musical styles which are not typically associated with rock groups, such as opera, music hall, folk music, gospel, ragtime, and <a3_0>dance/disco<a3_0/>. Several Queen songs were written with audience participation in mind, such as <a1_0>\"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\"<a1_0/>. Similarly, \"<a0_0>Radio Ga Ga<a0_0/>\" became a live favourite because it would have \"crowds clapping like they were at a Nuremberg rally\"."}
