It combines camp, vaudeville, and <a3_0>British music hall<a3_0/> with May's guitar virtuosity. The album's second single, \"Now I'm Here\", a more traditional hard rock composition, was a number <a1_0>eleven<a1_0/> hit in Britain, while the high speed rocker \"<a2_0>Stone Cold Crazy<a2_0/>\" featuring May's uptempo riffs is a precursor to speed metal. In recent years, the album has received acclaim from music publications: In 2006, Classic Rock ranked it number 28 in \"The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever\", and in 2007, Mojo ranked it No.88 in \"The 100 Records That Changed the World\".
