It again borrowed the name of a Marx Brothers movie, and its cover was similar to that of A Night at the Opera, a variation on the same Queen Crest. The most recognisable of the Marx Brothers, <a3_0>Groucho Marx<a3_0/>, invited Queen to visit him in his Los Angeles home in March 1977; there the band thanked him in person, and performed \"'39\" a cappella. Musically, A Day at the Races was by both fans' and critics' standards a strong effort, reaching number one in the UK and Japan, and number five in the US. The major hit on the album was \"<a1_0>Somebody to Love<a1_0/>\", a gospel-inspired song in which <a4_0>Mercury, May, and Taylor<a4_0/> multi-tracked their voices to create a 100-voice gospel choir. The song went to number two in the UK, and number thirteen in the US. The album also featured one of the band's heaviest songs, May's \"<a2_0>Tie Your Mother Down<a2_0/>\", which became a staple of their live shows."}
