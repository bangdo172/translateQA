The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for <a2_0>Leo<a2_0/> (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for <a3_0>Cancer<a3_0/> (May), and two fairies for <a1_0>Virgo<a1_0/> (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the <a4_0>United Kingdom<a4_0/>, particularly with the lion supporters. The original logo, as found on the reverse-side of the first album cover, was a simple line drawing but more intricate colour versions were used on later sleeves."}
