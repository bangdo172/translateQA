In September, after an acromonious split with Trident, the band negotiated themselves out of their <a2_0>Trident Studios<a2_0/> contract and searched for new management. One of the options they considered was an offer from Led Zeppelin's manager, <a3_0>Peter Grant<a3_0/>. Grant wanted them to sign with Led Zeppelin's own production company, Swan Song Records.
