The ASI allows the army to take a wide ranging MOS and focus it into a more specific MOS. For example, a combat medic, whose duties are to <a1_0>provide pre-hospital emergency treatment<a1_0/>, may receive ASI training to become a <b7_0>cardiovascular specialist, a dialysis specialist, or even a licensed practical nurse<b7_0/>. For commissioned officers, ASI training includes pre-commissioning training either <b6_0>at USMA, or via ROTC<b6_0/>, or by completing OCS. After commissioning, officers undergo branch specific training at the <a2_0><b5_0>Basic Officer Leaders Course<b5_0/><a2_0/>, (formerly called Officer Basic Course), which varies in time and location according their future assignments. Further career development is available through the <a3_0>Army Correspondence Course Program<a3_0/>."}
