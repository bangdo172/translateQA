Both reserve components are primarily composed of part-time soldiers who train once a month, known as battle assemblies or <a2_0>unit training assemblies<a2_0/> (UTAs), and conduct two to three weeks of annual training each year. Both the Regular Army and the Army Reserve are organized under Title <a3_0><b7_0>10<b7_0/><a3_0/> of the United States Code, while the National Guard is organized under Title 32. While the Army National Guard is organized, trained and equipped as a component of the U.S. Army, when it is not in federal service it is under the command of individual state and territorial governors; the District of Columbia National Guard, however, reports to <a4_0>the <b8_0>U.S. President<b8_0/><a4_0/>, not the district's mayor, even when not federalized. Any or all of the National Guard can be federalized by presidential order and against the governor's wishes."}
