Basic training consists of <a1_0><b6_0>10 weeks<b6_0/><a1_0/> for most recruits followed by Advanced Individualized Training (AIT) where they receive training for their military occupational specialties (MOS). Some individuals MOSs range anywhere from <a2_0><b7_0><b8_0>14\u201320 weeks<b8_0/><b7_0/><a2_0/> of <a3_0><b9_0>One Station Unit Training<b9_0/><a3_0/> (OSUT), which combines Basic Training and AIT. The length of AIT school varies by the MOS The length of time spent in AIT depends on the MOS of the soldier, and some highly technical MOS training may require many months (e.g., foreign language translators). Depending on the needs of the army, Basic Combat Training for combat arms soldiers is conducted at a number of locations, but two of the longest-running are the Armor School and the Infantry School, both at <a4_0>Fort Benning, Georgia<a4_0/>."}
