Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that American Idol \"isn't really about music. It's about all the bad aspects of the music business \u2013 the arrogance of commerce, this sense of 'I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don't know.' \" That American Idol is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry. <a2_0><a6_0>LeAnn Rimes<a6_0/><a2_0/>, commenting on <a4_0>Carrie Underwood<a4_0/> winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over <a5_0>Faith Hill<a5_0/> in <a1_0>2006<a1_0/>, said that \"Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award\". It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others. <a0_0><a7_0>Elton John<a7_0/><a0_0/>, who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on American Idol, commenting on talent shows in general, said that \"there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs\"."}
