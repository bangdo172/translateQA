In this live production, co-produced by <a3_0>19 Entertainment<a3_0/>, park guests chose from a list of songs and auditioned privately for Disney cast members. Those selected then performed on a stage in a 1000-seat theater replicating the Idol set. Three judges, whose mannerisms and style mimicked those of the real Idol judges, critiqued the performances. Audience members then voted for their favorite performer. There were several preliminary-round shows during the day that culminated in a \"finals\" show in the evening where one of the winners of the previous rounds that day was selected as the overall winner. The winner of the finals show received a \"<a6_0>Dream Ticket<a6_0/>\" that granted them front-of-the-line privileges at any future American Idol audition. The attraction closed on <a7_0>August 30, <a2_0>2014<a7_0/><a2_0/>."}
