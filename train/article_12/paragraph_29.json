Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, <a1_0><a7_0>From Justin to Kelly<a7_0/><a1_0/>, which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become the most successful Idol contestant internationally, with worldwide album sales of <a2_0><a8_0>more than 23 million<a8_0/><a2_0/>."}
