(In some older editions an acute accent mark was used for consistency with Old Norse conventions.) Additionally, modern editions often distinguish between velar and <a0_0>palatal<a0_0/> \u27e8c\u27e9 and \u27e8g\u27e9 by placing dots above the palatals: \u27e8\u010b\u27e9, \u27e8\u0121\u27e9. The letter wynn \u27e8\u01bf\u27e9 is usually replaced with \u27e8<a1_0>w<a1_0/>\u27e9, but \u00e6sc, eth and thorn are normally retained (except when eth is replaced by <a4_0>thorn<a4_0/>)."}
