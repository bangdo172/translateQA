Some Mercian texts continued to be written, however, and the influence of <b5_0>Mercian<b5_0/> is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred's programme, many of which were produced by Mercian scholars. Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in <b6_0>Middle and Modern English<b6_0/>. In fact, what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from <a0_0>Mercian<a0_0/> rather than West Saxon, while Scots developed from the <a1_0>Northumbrian<a1_0/> dialect.
