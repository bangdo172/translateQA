Like other <b5_0>old Germanic languages<b5_0/>, it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study. Old English grammar is quite similar to that of modern <a2_0>German<a2_0/>: nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs have many inflectional endings and forms, and word order is much freer. The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a runic system, but from about the <a3_0>9th<a3_0/> century this was replaced by <b6_0>a version of the Latin alphabet<b6_0/>."}
