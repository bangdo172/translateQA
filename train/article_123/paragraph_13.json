Old English also sometimes uses <b5_0>compound constructions<b5_0/> to express other verbal aspects, the future and the passive voice; in these we see the beginnings of the compound tenses of Modern English. Old English verbs include <b6_0>strong verbs<b6_0/>, which form the past tense by <a4_0>altering the root vowel<a4_0/>, and weak verbs, which use a suffix such as <a3_0>-de<a3_0/>. As in Modern English, and peculiar to the Germanic languages, the verbs formed two great classes: weak (regular), and strong (irregular). Like today, Old English had fewer strong verbs, and many of these have over time decayed into weak forms. Then, as now, <b7_0>dental suffixes<b7_0/> indicated the past tense of the weak verbs, as in work and worked."}
