The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character. <a1_0>Old Norse<a1_0/> and <b4_0>Old English<b4_0/> resembled each other closely like cousins and with some words in common, they roughly understood each other; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged. It is most \u201cimportant to recognize that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their <a2_0><b5_0>inflectional<a2_0/> elements<b5_0/>. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In <b6_0>the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw<b6_0/> these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost.\u201d This blending of peoples and languages happily resulted in \u201csimplifying English grammar.\u201d"}
