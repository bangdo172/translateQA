It came to be spoken over most of the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which became the Kingdom of England. This included most of present-day England, as well as part of what is now southeastern <b6_0>Scotland<b6_0/>, which for several centuries belonged to the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of <a3_0>Northumbria<a3_0/>. Other parts of the island \u2013 Wales and most of Scotland \u2013 continued to use Celtic languages, except in the areas of Scandinavian settlements where <b8_0>Old Norse<b8_0/> was spoken. Celtic speech also remained established in certain parts of England: <a4_0>Medieval Cornish<a4_0/> was spoken all over Cornwall and in adjacent parts of Devon, while <b7_0>Cumbric<b7_0/> survived perhaps to the 12th century in parts of Cumbria, and Welsh may have been spoken on the English side of the Anglo-Welsh border. Norse was also widely spoken in the parts of England which fell under Danish law."}
