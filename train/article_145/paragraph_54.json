Even the larger systems tend to be mounted on <a1_0>trailers<a1_0/> and are designed to be fairly quickly broken down or set up. In the past, this was not always the case. Early missile systems were cumbersome and required much infrastructure; many could not be moved at all. With the diversification of air defence there has been much more emphasis on mobility. Most modern systems are usually either self-propelled (i.e. guns or missiles are mounted on a truck or tracked chassis) or easily towed. Even systems that consist of many components (transporter/erector/launchers, radars, command posts etc.) benefit from being mounted on <a2_0>a fleet of vehicles<a2_0/>. In general, a fixed system can be identified, attacked and destroyed whereas a mobile system can show up in <a3_0>places where it is not expected<a3_0/>. <a4_0>Soviet<a4_0/> systems especially concentrate on mobility, after the lessons learnt in the Vietnam war between the USA and Vietnam.
