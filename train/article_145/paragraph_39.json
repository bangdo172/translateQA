Both France and UK introduced tachymetric devices to <a0_0>track targets and produce vertical and horizontal deflection angles<a0_0/>. The <a1_0>French Brocq<a1_0/> system was electrical, the operator entered the target range and had displays at guns; it was used with their <a2_0>75 mm<a2_0/>. The <a3_0>British Wilson-Dalby gun director<a3_0/> used a pair of trackers and mechanical tachymetry; the operator entered the fuse length, and deflection angles were read from the instruments."}
