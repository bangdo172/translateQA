Soon the forces were adding various <a1_0>machine-gun based weapons<a1_0/> mounted on poles. These short-range weapons proved more deadly, and the \"Red Baron\" is believed to have been shot down by an <a2_0>anti-aircraft Vickers machine gun<a2_0/>. When the war ended, it was clear that the <a3_0>increasing capabilities of aircraft<a3_0/> would require better means of acquiring targets and aiming at them. Nevertheless, a pattern had been set: anti-aircraft weapons would be based around heavy weapons attacking high-altitude targets and <a4_0>lighter weapons<a4_0/> for use when they came to lower altitudes."}
