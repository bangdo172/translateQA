Currently tests are underway on developing systems that could create as much damage as <a1_0>a Tomahawk<a1_0/> (missile), but at a fraction of the cost. In <a2_0>February 2008<a2_0/> the US Navy tested a railgun; it fired a shell at <a3_0>5,600 miles (9,000 km) per hour<a3_0/> using 10 megajoules of energy. Its expected performance is over 13,000 miles (21,000 km) per hour muzzle velocity, accurate enough to hit a 5-meter target from 200 nautical miles (370 km) away while shooting at 10 shots per minute. It is expected to be ready in <a4_0>2020 to 2025<a4_0/>.[verification needed] These systems while currently designed for static targets would only need the ability to be retargeted to become the next generation of AA system."}
