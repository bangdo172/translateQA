Various types of ammunition were proposed, high explosive, incendiary, bullet-chains, rod bullets and shrapnel. <a1_0>The need for some form of tracer or smoke trail<a1_0/> was articulated. <a2_0>Fuzing options<a2_0/> were also examined, both impact and time types. Mountings were generally pedestal type, but could be on field platforms. Trials were underway in most countries in Europe but only <a3_0>Krupp, Erhardt, Vickers Maxim, and Schneider<a3_0/> had published any information by 1910. Krupp's designs included adaptations of their 65 mm 9-pounder, a 75 mm 12-pounder, and even a 105 mm gun. Erhardt also had a 12-pounder, while Vickers Maxim offered a 3-pounder and Schneider a 47 mm. The <a4_0>French balloon gun<a4_0/> appeared in 1910, it was an 11-pounder but mounted on a vehicle, with a total uncrewed weight of 2 tons. However, since balloons were slow moving, sights were simple. But the challenges of faster moving airplanes were recognised."}
