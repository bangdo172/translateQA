In addition, Side looking radars, High-powered optical satellites, and sky-scanning, high-aperture, high sensitivity radars such as radio telescopes, would all be able to narrow down the location of a stealth aircraft under certain parameters. The newest SAM's have a claimed ability to be able to detect and engage stealth targets, with the most notable being <a3_0>the S-400<a3_0/>, which is claimed to be able to detect a target with a 0.05 meter squared RCS from <a4_0>90 km away<a4_0/>."}
