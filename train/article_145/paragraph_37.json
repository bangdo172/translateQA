The British Army adopted the 13-pounder quickly producing new mountings suitable for AA use, the <a1_0>13-pdr QF 6 cwt Mk III<a1_0/> was issued in 1915. It remained in service throughout the war but <a2_0>18-pdr guns<a2_0/> were lined down to take the 13-pdr shell with a larger cartridge producing the 13-pr QF 9 cwt and these proved much more satisfactory. However, in general, these ad-hoc solutions proved largely useless. With little experience in the role, no means of measuring target, range, height or speed the difficulty of observing their shell bursts relative to the target gunners proved unable to <a3_0>get their fuse setting correct<a3_0/> and most rounds burst <a4_0>well below their targets<a4_0/>. The exception to this rule was the guns protecting spotting balloons, in which case the altitude could be accurately measured from the length of the cable holding the balloon."}
