In <a1_0>1928<a1_0/> 3.7-inch became the preferred solution, but it took 6 years to gain funding. Production of the QF 3.7-inch (94 mm) began in 1937; this gun was used both on mobile carriages with the field army and transportable guns on fixed mountings for static positions. At the same time the Royal Navy adopted a new <a2_0>4.5-inch (114 mm) gun in a twin turret<a2_0/>, which the army adopted in simplified single-gun mountings for static positions, mostly around ports where naval ammunition was available. However, the performance of both 3.7 and 4.5-in guns was limited by their standard fuse No 199, with a <a3_0>30-second running time<a3_0/>, although a new mechanical time fuse giving 43 seconds was nearing readiness. In 1939 a <a4_0>Machine Fuse Setter<a4_0/> was introduced to eliminate manual fuse setting."}
