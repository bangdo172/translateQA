The first attempt to produce such a system used a 50 mm gun, but this proved inaccurate and <a2_0>a new 55 mm gun<a2_0/> replaced it. The system used <a3_0>a centralised control system<a3_0/> including both search and targeting radar, which calculated the aim point for the guns after considering windage and ballistics, and then sent electrical commands to the guns, which used <a4_0>hydraulics<a4_0/> to point themselves at high speeds. Operators simply fed the guns and selected the targets. This system, modern even by today's standards, was in late development when the war ended."}
