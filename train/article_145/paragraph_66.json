The 419th and 601st Antiaircraft Gun Battalions of the US Army were first allocated to the <a1_0>Folkestone-Dover coast<a1_0/> to defend London, and then moved to <a2_0>Belgium<a2_0/> to become part of the \"Antwerp X\" project. With the liberation of <a3_0>Antwerp<a3_0/>, the port city immediately became the highest priority target, and received the largest number of V-1 and V-2 missiles of any city. The smallest tactical unit of the operation was a gun battery consisting of four 90 mm guns firing shells equipped with a radio proximity fuse. Incoming targets were acquired and automatically tracked by <a4_0>SCR-584 radar<a4_0/>, developed at the MIT Rad Lab. Output from the gun-laying radar was fed to the M-9 director, an electronic analog computer developed at Bell Laboratories to calculate the lead and elevation corrections for the guns. With the help of these three technologies, close to 90% of the V-1 missiles, on track to the defence zone around the port, were destroyed."}
