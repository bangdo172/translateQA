The problem was of <a0_0>successfully aiming a shell to burst close to its target's future position<a0_0/>, with various factors affecting the shells' <a1_0>predicted trajectory<a1_0/>. This was called deflection gun-laying, <a2_0>'off-set' angles for range and elevation<a2_0/> were set on the gunsight and updated as their target moved. In this method when the sights were on the target, the barrel was pointed at <a3_0>the target's future position<a3_0/>. <a4_0>Range and height of the target<a4_0/> determined fuse length. The difficulties increased as aircraft performance improved."}
