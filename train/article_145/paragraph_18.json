Before the war it was recognised that ammunition needed to explode <a0_0>in the air<a0_0/>. Both high explosive (HE) and <a1_0>shrapnel<a1_0/> were used, mostly the former. Airburst fuses were either <a2_0>igniferious (based on a burning fuse) or mechanical (clockwork)<a2_0/>. Igniferious fuses were not well suited for anti-aircraft use. The fuse length was determined by time of flight, but the burning rate of the gunpowder was affected by altitude. The British pom-poms had only contact-fused ammunition. <a3_0>Zeppelins<a3_0/>, being hydrogen filled balloons, were targets for incendiary shells and the British introduced these with airburst fuses, both shrapnel type-forward projection of incendiary 'pot' and base ejection of an incendiary stream. The British also fitted tracers to their shells for use at night. <a4_0>Smoke shells<a4_0/> were also available for some AA guns, these bursts were used as targets during training."}
