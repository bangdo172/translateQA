Even this formerly front-line weapon is currently being replaced by new missile systems, such as the <a3_0>RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile<a3_0/>, which is smaller, faster, and allows for mid-flight course correction (guidance) to ensure a hit. To bridge the gap between guns and missiles, Russia in particular produces the <a4_0>Kashtan CIWS<a4_0/>, which uses both guns and missiles for final defence. Two six-barrelled 30 mm Gsh-6-30 Gatling guns and 9M311 surface-to-air missiles provide for its defensive capabilities."}
