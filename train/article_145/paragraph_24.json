The similar <a1_0>Allied smaller-calibre air-defence weapons systems<a1_0/> of the American forces were also quite capable, although they receive little attention. Their needs could cogently be met with smaller-calibre ordnance beyond using the usual singly-mounted M2 .50 caliber machine gun atop a tank's turret, as <a2_0>four<a2_0/> of the ground-used \"heavy barrel\" (M2HB) guns were mounted together on the American Maxson firm's M45 Quadmount weapons system (as a direct answer to <a3_0>the Flakvierling<a3_0/>),which were often mounted on the back of a half-track to form the Half Track, M16 GMC, Anti-Aircraft. Although of less power than Germany's 20 mm systems, the typical 4 or 5 combat batteries of an Army AAA battalion were often spread <a4_0>many kilometers<a4_0/> apart from each other, rapidly attaching and detaching to larger ground combat units to provide welcome defence from enemy aircraft."}
