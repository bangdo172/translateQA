Operators kept it pointed at the target, and the Predictor then calculated <a1_0>the proper aim point automatically<a1_0/> and displayed it <a2_0>as a pointer mounted on the gun<a2_0/>. The gun operators simply <a3_0>followed the pointer and loaded the shells<a3_0/>. The Kerrison was fairly simple, but it pointed the way to future generations that incorporated radar, first for ranging and later for tracking. Similar predictor systems were introduced by <a4_0>Germany<a4_0/> during the war, also adding radar ranging as the war progressed."}
