The SAMs launched by individuals are known in the United States as the <a2_0>Man-Portable Air Defence Systems<a2_0/> (<a1_0>MANPADS<a1_0/>). MANPADS of the former Soviet Union have been exported around the World, and can be found in use by many armed forces. Targets for non-ManPAD SAMs will usually be acquired by <a3_0>air-search radar<a3_0/>, then tracked before/while a SAM is \"locked-on\" and then fired. Potential targets, if they are military aircraft, will be identified as friend or foe before being engaged.
