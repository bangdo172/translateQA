This led to the Height/Range Finder (HRF), the first model being the <a1_0>Barr & Stroud UB2<a1_0/>, a 2-metre optical coincident rangefinder mounted on a tripod. It measured the distance to the target and the <a2_0>elevation angle<a2_0/>, which together gave the height of the aircraft. These were complex instruments and various other methods were also used. The HRF was soon joined by the <a3_0>Height/Fuse Indicator (HFI)<a3_0/>, this was marked with elevation angles and height lines overlaid with fuse length curves, using the height reported by the <a4_0>HRF operator<a4_0/>, the necessary fuse length could be read off."}
