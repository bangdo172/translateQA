Often, the high-altitude long-range missile systems force aircraft to fly at low level, where anti-aircraft guns can bring them down. As well as the small and large systems, for effective air defence there must be intermediate systems. These may be deployed at regiment-level and consist of platoons of self-propelled anti-aircraft platforms, whether they are <a3_0>self-propelled anti-aircraft guns<a3_0/> (SPAAGs), integrated air-defence systems like Tunguska or <a4_0>all-in-one surface-to-air missile platforms<a4_0/> like Roland or SA-8 Gecko."}
