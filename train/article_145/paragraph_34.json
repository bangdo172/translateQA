However, during the Second World War the <a1_0>RAF Regiment<a1_0/> was formed to protect airfields everywhere, and this included light air defences. In the later decades of the <a2_0>Cold War<a2_0/> this included the United States Air Force's operating bases in UK. However, all ground-based air defence was removed from Royal Air Force (RAF) jurisdiction in <a3_0>2004<a3_0/>. The <a4_0>British Army's Anti-Aircraft Command<a4_0/> was disbanded in March 1955, but during the 1960s and 1970s the RAF's Fighter Command operated long-range air -defence missiles to protect key areas in the UK. During World War II the Royal Marines also provided air defence units; formally part of the mobile naval base defence organisation, they were handled as an integral part of the army-commanded ground based air defences."}
