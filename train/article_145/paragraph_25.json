The balloon, a simple blimp tethered to the ground, worked in two ways. Firstly, it and the <a2_0>steel cable<a2_0/> were a danger to any aircraft that tried to fly among them. Secondly, to avoid the balloons, bombers had to <a3_0>fly at a higher altitude<a3_0/>, which was more favorable for the guns. Barrage balloons were limited in application, and had <a4_0>minimal<a4_0/> success at bringing down aircraft, being largely immobile and passive defences."}
