Soldiers shot at them with shotguns and machine-guns but failed to prevent them from dropping <a1_0>45<a1_0/> bombs over the city, hitting military installations, the railway station and many other, mostly civilian, targets in the city. During the bombing raid, private <a2_0>Radoje Ljutovac<a2_0/> fired his cannon at the enemy aircraft and successfully shot one down. It crashed in the city and <a3_0>both pilots died<a3_0/> from their injuries. The cannon Ljutovac used was not designed as an anti-aircraft gun, it was a slightly modified Turkish cannon captured during the <a4_0>First Balkan War in 1912<a4_0/>. This was the first occasion in military history that a military aircraft was shot down with ground-to-air fire."}
