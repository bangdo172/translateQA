Further research started during the war. The first step was unguided missile systems like <a1_0>the British 2-inch RP and 3-inch<a1_0/>, which was fired in large numbers from Z batteries, and were also fitted to warships. The firing of one of these devices during an air raid is suspected to have caused the Bethnal Green disaster in <a2_0>1943<a2_0/>. Facing the threat of Japanese Kamikaze attacks the British and US developed surface-to-air rockets like British Stooge or the <a3_0>American Lark<a3_0/> as counter measures, but none of them were ready at the end of the war. The <a4_0>Germans missile research<a4_0/> was the most advanced of the war as the Germans put considerable effort in the research and development of rocket systems for all purposes. Among them were several guided and unguided systems. Unguided systems involved the Fliegerfaust (literally \"aircraft fist\") as the first MANPADS. Guided systems were several sophisticated radio, wire, or radar guided missiles like the Wasserfall (\"waterfall\") rocket. Due to the severe war situation for Germany all of those systems were only produced in small numbers and most of them were only used by training or trial units."}
