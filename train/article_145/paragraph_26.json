However, many different definitions are used but unless the same definition is used, performance of different guns or missiles cannot be compared. For AA guns <a1_0>only the ascending part of the trajectory<a1_0/> can be usefully used. One term is 'ceiling', <a2_0>maximum ceiling<a2_0/> being the height a projectile would reach if fired vertically, not practically useful in itself as few AA guns are able to fire <a3_0>vertically<a3_0/>, and maximum fuse duration may be too short, but potentially useful as a standard to compare different weapons."}
