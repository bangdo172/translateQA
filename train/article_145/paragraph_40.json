Significant AA warfare started with the <a1_0>Battle of Britain<a1_0/> in the summer of 1940. 3.7-inch HAA were to provide the backbone of the groundbased AA defences, although initially significant numbers of 3-inch 20-cwt were also used. The <a2_0>Army's Anti-aircraft command<a2_0/>, which was under command of the Air Defence UK organisation, grew to 12 AA divisions in <a3_0>3<a3_0/> AA corps. 40-mm Bofors entered service in increasing numbers. In addition the <a4_0>RAF regiment<a4_0/> was formed in 1941 with responsibility for airfield air defence, eventually with Bofors 40mm as their main armament. Fixed AA defences, using HAA and LAA, were established by the Army in key overseas places, notably Malta, Suez Canal and Singapore."}
