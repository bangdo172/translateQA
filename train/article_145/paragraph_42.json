At <a1_0>short range<a1_0/>, the apparent target area is relatively large, the trajectory is flat and the time of flight is short, allowing to correct lead <a2_0>by watching the tracers<a2_0/>. At long range, the aircraft remains in firing range for a long time, so the necessary calculations can in theory be done by <a3_0>slide rules<a3_0/> - though, because <a4_0>small errors in distance<a4_0/> cause large errors in shell fall height and detonation time, exact ranging is crucial. For the ranges and speeds that the Bofors worked at, neither answer was good enough."}
