The outer layer will usually be provided by the carrier's aircraft, specifically its <a1_0>AEW&C aircraft combined with the CAP<a1_0/>. If an attacker is able to penetrate this layer, then the next layers would come from the surface-to-air missiles carried by <a2_0>the carrier's escorts<a2_0/>; the area-defence missiles, such as the RIM-67 Standard, with a range of up to <a3_0>100<a3_0/> nmi, and the point-defence missiles, like the RIM-162 ESSM, with a range of up to 30 nmi. Finally, virtually every modern warship will be fitted with small-calibre guns, including a CIWS, which is usually a radar-controlled Gatling gun of between 20mm and 30mm calibre capable of firing <a4_0>several thousand rounds per minute<a4_0/>."}
