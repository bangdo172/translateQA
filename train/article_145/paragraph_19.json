Second, that the target would maintain a steady course, <a2_0>speed and height<a2_0/>. This HAA was to engage targets up to <a3_0>24,000 feet<a3_0/>. <a4_0>Mechanical<a4_0/>, as opposed to igniferous, time fuses were required because the speed of powder burning varied with height so fuse length was not a simple function of time of flight. Automated fire ensured a constant rate of fire that made it easier to predict where each shell should be individually aimed."}
