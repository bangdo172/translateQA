The following year they decided to adopt the Bofors 40 mm and a twin barrel Vickers 2-pdr (40 mm) on a modified naval mount. <a3_0>The air-cooled Bofors<a3_0/> was vastly superior for land use, being much lighter than the water-cooled pom-pom, and UK production of the Bofors 40 mm was licensed. <a4_0>The Predictor AA No 3<a4_0/>, as the Kerrison Predictor was officially known, was introduced with it."}
