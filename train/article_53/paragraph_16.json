Their separate status dates back to the <a1_0>12th<a1_0/> century when the Normans split them off from the <b6_0>mixed secular/religious county and local courts used by the Saxons<b6_0/>. In contrast to the other courts of <b7_0>England<b7_0/> the law used in ecclesiastical matters is at least partially a civil law system, not <a2_0>common law<a2_0/>, although heavily governed by parliamentary statutes. Since the Reformation, ecclesiastical courts in England have been <b8_0>royal courts<b8_0/>. The teaching of canon law at the <b9_0>Universities of <a3_0>Oxford and Cambridge<b9_0/><a3_0/> was abrogated by <a4_0>Henry VIII<a4_0/>; thereafter practitioners in the ecclesiastical courts were trained in civil law, receiving a Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) degree from Oxford, or a Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree from Cambridge. Such lawyers (called \"doctors\" and \"civilians\") were centered at \"Doctors Commons\", a few streets south of St Paul's Cathedral in London, where they monopolized probate, matrimonial, and admiralty cases until their jurisdiction was removed to the common law courts in the mid-19th century."}
