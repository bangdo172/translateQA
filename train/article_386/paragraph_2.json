Much of Brittonic-controlled Britain was conquered by the <a2_0>Roman Empire<a2_0/> from <b6_0><b12_0>AD 43<b12_0/><b6_0/>. The first <b7_0>Anglo-Saxons<b7_0/> arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now <b13_0>England.<b13_0/> Viking invasions began in the <a3_0>9th century<a3_0/>, followed by more permanent settlements and political change\u2014particularly in England. The subsequent Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the later Angevin partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, while control in Ireland fluxed between Gaelic kingdoms, Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated Lordship of Ireland, soon restricted only to The Pale. The 1603 Union of the Crowns, Acts of Union 1707 and Acts of Union 1800 attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as Crown Dependencies. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty (<b14_0>1919\u20131922<b14_0/>), with <b9_0>six counties<b9_0/> remaining in the UK as <a4_0>Northern Ireland<a4_0/>."}
