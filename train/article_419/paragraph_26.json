If his or her party controls the White House, the <a0_0>minority leader confers regularly with the President and his aides about issues before Congress<a0_0/>, the Administration's agenda, and political events generally. Strategically, the role of the minority leader <a2_0>will vary depending on whether the President is of the same party or the other party<a2_0/>. In general, minority leaders will often work to advance the goals and aspirations of their party's President in Congress. When Robert Michel, R-IL, was minority leader <b3_0>(1981\u20131995)<b3_0/>, he typically functioned as <b4_0>the \"<a1_0>point man\"<b4_0/> for Republican presidents<a1_0/>. President Ronald Reagan's <b6_0>1981<b6_0/> policy successes in the Democratic controlled House was due in no small measure to Minority Leader Michel's effectiveness in wooing so-called <b5_0>\"Reagan Democrats\"<b5_0/> to support, for instance, the Administration's landmark <b7_0>budget reconciliation<b7_0/> bill. There are occasions, of course, when minority leaders will fault the legislative initiatives of their President. On an administration proposal that could adversely affect his district, Michel stated that he might \"abdicate my leadership role [on this issue] since I can't harmonize my own views with the administration's.\" Minority Leader Gephardt, as another example, has publicly opposed a number of President Clinton's legislative initiatives from \"fast track\" trade authority to various budget issues."}
