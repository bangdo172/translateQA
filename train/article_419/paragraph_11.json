On December 3, 1883, the House elected Democrat John G. Carlisle of Kentucky as Speaker. Republicans placed in nomination for the speakership J. Warren Keifer of Ohio, who was Speaker the previous Congress. Clearly, Keifer was not the Republicans' minority leader. He was a discredited leader in part because as Speaker <b3_0>he <a1_0>arbitrarily handed out \"choice jobs to close relatives<b3_0/> ... all at handsome salaries.<a1_0/>\" Keifer received \"<b4_0>the empty honor of the minority nomination<b4_0/>. But with it came a sting -- for while this naturally involves the floor leadership, he was deserted by <b5_0>his [partisan] associates<b5_0/> and <b6_0>his career as a national figure terminated ingloriously<b6_0/>.\" <b7_0>Representative <a2_0>Thomas Reed<b7_0/>,<a2_0/> R-ME, who later became Speaker, assumed the de facto role of minority floor leader in Keifer's stead. \"[A]lthough Keifer was the minority's candidate for Speaker, Reed became its acknowledged leader, and ever after, so long as he served in the House, remained the most conspicuous member of his party."}
