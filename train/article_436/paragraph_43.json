Second only to <a0_0>New Orleans<a0_0/> in its concentration of cast iron work, the city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches, balconies, fences, and finials. Richmond's position as a center of iron production helped to fuel its popularity within the city. At the height of production in the <a1_0>1890<a1_0/>, 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal workers. This number is <a2_0>seven times<a2_0/> the number of general construction workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance of its iron exports.

In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application."}
