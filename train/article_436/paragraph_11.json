Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly gave way to <a0_0>railroads<a0_0/>, allowing Richmond to become a major railroad crossroads, eventually including the site of the world's first <a1_0>triple<a1_0/> railroad crossing. Tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a role, boosted by the world's first cigarette-rolling machine, invented by <a2_0>James Albert Bonsack<a2_0/> of <a3_0>Roanoke<a3_0/> in 1880/81. Contributing to Richmond's resurgence was the first successful electrically powered trolley system in the United States, the <a4_0>Richmond Union Passenger Railway<a4_0/>. Designed by electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line in 1888, and electric streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the country. Sprague's system used an overhead wire and trolley pole to collect current, with electric motors on the car's trucks. In Richmond, the transition from streetcars to buses began in May 1947 and was completed on November 25, 1949."}
