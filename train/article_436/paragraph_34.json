Near the riverfront is the Richmond National Battlefield Park Visitors Center and the American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar, both housed in the former buildings of the <a0_0>Tredegar Iron Works<a0_0/>, where much of the ordnance for the war was produced. In Court End, near the <a1_0>Virginia State Capitol<a1_0/>, is the Museum of the Confederacy, along with the Davis Mansion, also known as the <a2_0>White House of the Confederacy<a2_0/>; both feature a wide variety of objects and material from the era. The temporary home of former Confederate General Robert E. Lee still stands on <a3_0>Franklin<a3_0/> Street in downtown Richmond. The history of slavery and emancipation are also increasingly represented: there is a former slave trail along the river that leads to Ancarrow's Boat Ramp and Historic Site which has been developed with interpretive signage, and in 2007, the Reconciliation Statue was placed in Shockoe Bottom, with parallel statues placed in <a4_0>Liverpool and Benin<a4_0/> representing points of the Triangle Trade."}
