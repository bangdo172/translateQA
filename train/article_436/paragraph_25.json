In the 1950s, Muslims from the East End got organized under Nation of Islam (NOI). They used to meet in <a0_0>Temple #24<a0_0/> located on North Avenue. After the NOI split in 1975, the Muslims who joined mainstream Islam, start meeting at Shabaaz Restaurant on <a4_0>Nine Mile Road<a4_0/>. By 1976, the Muslims used to meet in a rented church. They tried to buy this church, but due to financial difficulties the Muslims instead bought an old grocery store at <a1_0>Chimbarazoo Boulevard<a1_0/>, the present location of Masjid Bilal. Initially, the place was called \"<a2_0>Masjid Muhammad #24<a2_0/>\". Only by 1990 did the Muslims renamed it to \"Masjid Bilal\". Masjid Bilal was followed by the Islamic Center of Virginia, ICVA masjid. The ICVA was established in <a3_0>1973<a3_0/> as a non profit tax exempt organization. With aggressive fundraising, ICVA was able to buy land on Buford road. Construction of the new masjid began in the early 1980s. The rest of the five current masjids in the Richmond area are Islamic Center of Richmond (ICR) in the west end, Masjid Umm Barakah on 2nd street downtown, Islamic Society of Greater Richmond (ISGR) in the west end, Masjidullah in the north side, and Masjid Ar-Rahman in the east end."}
