However, dry periods lasting several weeks do occur, especially in <a0_0>autumn<a0_0/> when long periods of pleasant, mild weather are most common. There is considerable variability in total monthly amounts from year to year so that no one month can be depended upon to be normal. Snow has been recorded during seven of the twelve months. Falls of 3 inches (7.6 cm) or more within 24 hours occur an average <a1_0>once<a1_0/> per year. Annual snowfall, however, is usually light, averaging 10.5 inches (<a2_0>27<a2_0/> cm) per season. Snow typically remains on the ground only one or two days at a time, but remained for 16 days in 2010 (<a3_0>January 30 to February 14<a3_0/>). Ice storms (<a4_0>freezing rain or glaze<a4_0/>) are not uncommon, but they are seldom severe enough to do any considerable damage."}
