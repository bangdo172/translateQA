To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, George Washington helped design the <a0_0>James River and Kanawha Canal<a0_0/> in the 18th century to bypass Richmond's rapids, with the intent of providing a water route across the Appalachians to the <a1_0>Kanawha River<a1_0/>. The legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag. As a result of this and ample access to hydropower due to the falls, Richmond became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities in the country, including iron works and flour mills, the largest facilities of their kind in the South. The resistance to the slave trade was growing by the mid-nineteenth century; in one famous case in 1848, Henry \"<a3_0>Box<a3_0/>\" Brown made history by having himself nailed into a small box and shipped from Richmond to abolitionists in <a2_0>Philadelphia<a2_0/>, Pennsylvania, escaping slavery."}
