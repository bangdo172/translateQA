The age of printing made the scribal profession effectively redundant. Printed editions, while less susceptible to the proliferation of variations likely to arise during manual transmission, are nonetheless <a1_0>not immune to introducing variations from an author's autograph<a1_0/>. Instead of a scribe miscopying his source, <a2_0>a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph<a2_0/>. Since each scribe or printer commits different errors, <b6_0>reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources<b6_0/>. An edited <b7_0>text that draws from multiple sources is said to be <a3_0>eclectic<b7_0/>.<a3_0/> In contrast to this approach, some textual critics prefer to identify the single best surviving text, and not to combine readings from multiple sources."}
