In biology, the technique is used <a0_0>to determine the evolutionary relationships between different species<a0_0/>. In its application in textual criticism, the text of a number of different manuscripts is entered into a computer, which records all the differences between them. The <a1_0>manuscripts are then grouped according to their shared characteristics<a1_0/>. The difference between cladistics and more traditional forms of statistical analysis is that, rather than simply arranging the manuscripts into rough groupings according to their overall similarity, <a2_0>cladistics assumes that <b6_0>they are part of a branching family tree<b6_0/><a2_0/> and uses that assumption to derive relationships between them. This makes it more like an automated approach to stemmatics. However, where there is a difference, the computer does not attempt to decide which reading is closer to the original text, and so <a3_0>does not indicate which branch of the tree is the \"root\"<a3_0/>\u2014which manuscript tradition is closest to the original. Other types of evidence must be used for that purpose."}
