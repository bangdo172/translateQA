Thus was born the FARMS Critical Text Project which published <a2_0>the first volume of the 3-volume <b7_0>Book of Mormon Critical Text<b7_0/> in <b6_0>1984<b6_0/>. <a3_0>The third volume of that first edition was published in 1987<a2_0/>, but was already being superseded by a second, revised edition of the entire work<a3_0/>, greatly aided through the advice and assistance of then Yale doctoral candidate Grant Hardy, Dr. Gordon C. Thomasson, <a4_0>Professor John W. Welch<a4_0/> (the head of FARMS), Professor Royal Skousen, and others too numerous to mention here. However, these were merely preliminary steps to a far more exacting and all-encompassing project."}
