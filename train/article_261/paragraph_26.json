At that time <b6_0>BYU<b6_0/> Professor Ellis Rasmussen and his associates were asked by the <b7_0>LDS Church<b7_0/> to begin preparation for a new edition of the Holy Scriptures. One aspect of that effort entailed <a1_0>digitizing the text and preparing appropriate footnotes<a1_0/>, another aspect required establishing the most dependable text. To that latter end, Stanley R. Larson (a Rasmussen graduate student) set about <a2_0>applying <b8_0>modern text critical standards<b8_0/> to the manuscripts<a2_0/> and early editions of the Book of Mormon as his thesis project \u2013 which he completed in <a3_0><b9_0>1974<b9_0/><a3_0/>. To that end, Larson carefully examined the Original Manuscript (the one dictated by Joseph Smith to his scribes) and the Printer\u2019s Manuscript (the copy Oliver Cowdery prepared for the Printer in 1829\u20131830), and compared them with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions of the Book of Mormon to determine what sort of changes had occurred over time and to make judgments as to which readings were the most original. <a4_0>Larson<a4_0/> proceeded to publish a useful set of well-argued articles on the phenomena which he had discovered. Many of his observations were included as improvements in the 1981 LDS edition of the Book of Mormon."}
