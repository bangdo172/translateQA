Silver Proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime, quarter, and half dollar containing <a1_0><b6_0>90%<b6_0/><a1_0/> silver. Starting in <a2_0><b7_0>1983<b7_0/><a2_0/> and ending in 1997, the Mint also produced proof sets containing the year's commemorative coins alongside the regular coins. Another type of proof set is the <a3_0><b8_0>Presidential Dollar Proof Set<b8_0/><a3_0/> where four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a president. Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new Presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on <a4_0><b9_0>December 13, 2011<b9_0/><a4_0/>, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Future minting of such coins will be made solely for collectors."}
