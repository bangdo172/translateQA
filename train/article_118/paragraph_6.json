Silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated. This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the <a2_0><b7_0>War of 1812<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from <a0_0><b5_0>1777<b5_0/><a0_0/> to 1788. With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited, the continentals quickly lost their value, giving rise to the phrase <a3_0>\"<b8_0>not worth a continental<b8_0/>\"<a3_0/>. This was a primary reason for the \"No state shall... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts\" clause in <a4_0><b9_0>article 1<b9_0/><a4_0/>, section 10 of the United States Constitution."}
