This term, dating to the <a1_0><b6_0>18th<b6_0/><a1_0/> century, may have originated with the <a2_0><b7_0>colonial leather trade<b7_0/><a2_0/>. It may also have originated from a poker term. \"<a3_0><b8_0>Greenback<b8_0/><a3_0/>\" is another nickname originally applied specifically to the 19th century Demand Note dollars created by Abraham Lincoln to finance the costs of the Civil War for the North. The original note was printed in <a4_0><b9_0>black<b9_0/><a4_0/> and green on the back side. It is still used to refer to the U.S. dollar (but not to the dollars of other countries). Other well-known names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include \"greenmail\", \"green\" and \"dead presidents\" (the last because deceased presidents are pictured on most bills)."}
