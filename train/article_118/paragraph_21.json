Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions \"E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P\". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to \"heads\", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying <a3_0><b8_0>\"upside down lettering error\" coins<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more <a2_0><b7_0>profit<b7_0/><a2_0/> from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only <a4_0><b9_0>$1 bills<b9_0/><a4_0/>, though a few will give change in dollar coins."}
