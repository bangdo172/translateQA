The choice of the value 371 grains arose from <a3_0><b8_0>Alexander Hamilton<b8_0/><a3_0/>'s decision to base the new American unit on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. Hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of Spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains. A new Spanish dollar was usually about <a4_0><b9_0>377<b9_0/><a4_0/> grains in weight, and so the new U.S. dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar."}
