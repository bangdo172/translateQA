Based on the success of the \"50 State Quarters\" series, the new coin features a sequence of presidents in order of their inaugurations, starting with George Washington, on the obverse side. The reverse side features the <a1_0><b6_0>Statue of Liberty<b6_0/><a1_0/>. To allow for larger, more detailed portraits, the traditional inscriptions of \"<a2_0><b7_0>E Pluribus Unum<b7_0/><a2_0/>\", \"In God We Trust\", the year of minting or issuance, and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face. This feature, similar to the edge inscriptions seen on the British \u00a31 coin, is not usually associated with U.S. coin designs. The inscription <a3_0><b8_0>\"Liberty\"<b8_0/><a3_0/> has been eliminated, with the Statue of Liberty serving as a sufficient replacement. In addition, due to the nature of U.S. coins, this will be the first time there will be circulating U.S. coins of different denominations with the same president featured on the obverse (heads) side (Lincoln/penny, Jefferson/nickel, Franklin D. Roosevelt/dime, Washington/quarter, Kennedy/half dollar, and Eisenhower/dollar). Another unusual fact about the new $1 coin is <a4_0><b9_0>Grover Cleveland<b9_0/><a4_0/> will have two coins with his portrait issued due to the fact he was the only U.S. President to be elected to two non-consecutive terms."}
