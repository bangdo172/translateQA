The suffix \"K\" or \"k\" (from \"kilo-\") is also commonly used to denote this amount (such as \"$10k\" to mean $10,000). However, the $1,000 note is no longer in general use. A \"large\" or <a1_0>\"<b6_0>stack<b6_0/>\"<a1_0/>, it is usually a reference to a multiple of $1,000 (such as \"fifty large\" meaning $50,000). The $100 note is nicknamed \"Benjamin\", \"Benji\", \"Ben\", or \"Franklin\" (after Benjamin Franklin), \"C-note\" (C being <a2_0><b7_0>the Roman numeral for 100<b7_0/><a2_0/>), \"Century note\" or \"bill\" (e.g. \"two bills\" being $200). The <a3_0><b8_0>$50<b8_0/><a3_0/> note is occasionally called a \"yardstick\" or a \"grant\" (after President Ulysses S. Grant, pictured on the obverse). The $20 note is referred to as a \"double sawbuck\", \"Jackson\" (after Andrew Jackson), or \"double eagle\". The $10 note is referred to as a \"sawbuck\", \"ten-spot\" or \"Hamilton\" (after Alexander Hamilton). The $5 note as \"Lincoln\", \"fin\", \"fiver\" or \"five-spot\". The infrequently-used $2 note is sometimes called \"deuce\", \"Tom\", or \"Jefferson\" (after Thomas Jefferson). The $1 note as a \"single\" or \"buck\". The dollar has also been, referred to as a \"bone\" and \"bones\" in plural (e.g. \"twenty bones\" is equal to $20). The newer designs, with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse rather than in cameo insets upon paper color-coded by denomination, are sometimes referred to as \"bigface\" notes or \"<a4_0><b9_0>Monopoly money<b9_0/><a4_0/>\"."}
