Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German Taler, a word that eventually found its way into Danish and Swedish as daler, Norwegian as dalar and daler, Dutch as daler or daalder, Ethiopian as \u1273\u120b\u122a (talari), Hungarian as tall\u00e9r, Italian as <a3_0><b8_0>tallero<b8_0/><a3_0/>, and English as dollar. Alternatively, thaler is said to come from the German coin <a4_0><b9_0>Guldengroschen<b9_0/><a4_0/> (\"great guilder\", being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder), minted from the silver from Joachimsthal."}
