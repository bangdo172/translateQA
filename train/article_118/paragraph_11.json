In that context, \"dollars\" is a reference to <a0_0><b5_0>the Spanish milled dollar<b5_0/><a0_0/>, a coin that had a monetary value of <a1_0><b6_0>8 Spanish units<b6_0/><a1_0/> of currency, or reales. In 1792 the U.S. Congress adopted legislation titled An act establishing a mint, and regulating the Coins of the United States. Section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins, including \"DOLLARS OR UNITS\u2014each to be of the value of <a2_0><b7_0>a Spanish milled dollar<b7_0/><a2_0/> as the same is now current, and to contain <a4_0><b9_0>three hundred and seventy-one<b9_0/><a4_0/> grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or <a3_0><b8_0>four hundred and sixteen<b8_0/><a3_0/> grains of standard silver\". Section 20 of the act provided, \"That the money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars, or units... and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation\". In other words, this act designated the United States dollar as the unit of currency of the United States."}
