Many historians[who?] erroneously assume gold was standardized at a fixed rate in parity with silver; however, there is no evidence of Congress making this law. This has to do with <a2_0><b7_0>Alexander Hamilton<b7_0/><a2_0/>'s suggestion to Congress of a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold, respectively. The gold coins that were minted however, were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a market value relative to the <a3_0><b8_0>Congressional standard of the silver dollar<b8_0/><a3_0/>. <a4_0><b9_0>1834<b9_0/><a4_0/> saw a shift in the gold standard to 23.2 grains (1.50 g), followed by a slight adjustment to 23.22 grains (1.505 g) in 1837 (16:1 ratio).[citation needed]"}
