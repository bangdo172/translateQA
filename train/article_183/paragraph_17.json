Rumor was the Cubs could hold home games across town at <a1_0>Comiskey Park<a1_0/>, home of the American League's <a2_0>Chicago White Sox<a2_0/>. Rather than hold any games in the cross town rival Sox Park, the Cubs made arrangements with the August A. Busch, owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, to use Busch Stadium in St. Louis as the Cubs \"home field\" for the World Series. This was approved by Major League Baseball and would have enabled the Cubs to host games 1 and 2, along with games 6 and 7 if necessary. At the time home field advantage was rotated between each league. Odd numbered years the AL had home field advantage. Even numbered years the NL had home field advantage. In the 1982 World Series the St. Louis Cardinals of the NL had home field advantage. In the 1983 World Series the <a3_0>Baltimore Orioles<a3_0/> of the AL had home field advantage."}
