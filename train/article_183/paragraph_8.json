In <a2_0>Game 4 of the Series<a2_0/>, the Curse of the Billy Goat was allegedly laid upon the Cubs when P.K. Wrigley ejected Billy Sianis, who had come to Game 4 with two box seat tickets, one for him and one for his goat. They paraded around for a few innings, but Wrigley demanded the <a3_0>goat<a3_0/> leave the park due to its unpleasant odor. Upon his ejection, Mr. Sianis uttered, \"The Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more.\" The Cubs lost Game 4, lost the Series, and have not been back since. It has also been said by many that Sianis put a \"curse\" on the Cubs, apparently preventing the team from playing in the World Series. After losing the 1945 World Series to the Detroit Tigers, the Cubs finished with winning seasons the next two years, but those teams did not enter post-season play."}
