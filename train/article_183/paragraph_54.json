There is no record of whether or not he was just a fan in a costume or employed by the club. Through the <a1_0>2013 season<a1_0/>, there were \"Cubbie-bear\" mascots outside of Wrigley on game day, but none are employed by the team. They pose for pictures with fans for tips. The most notable of these was \"Billy Cub\" who worked outside of the stadium until for over 6 years until July 2013, when the club asked him to stop. Billy Cub, who is played by fan <a2_0>John Paul Weier<a2_0/>, had unsuccessfully petitioned the team to become the official mascot."}
