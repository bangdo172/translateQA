Caray often playfully quarreled with <a1_0>Stone<a1_0/> <a2_0>over Stone's cigar<a2_0/> and why Stone was single, while Stone would counter with poking fun at Harry being \"under the influence.\" Stone disclosed in his book \"Where's Harry\" that most of this \"arguing\" was staged, and usually a ploy developed by Harry himself to add flavor to the broadcast. The Cubs still have a \"guest conductor\", usually a celebrity, lead the crowd in singing \"<a3_0>Take me out to the ballgame<a3_0/>\" during the 7th inning stretch to honor Caray's memory."}
