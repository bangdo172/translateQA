Initially, the group was called \"bums\" because it referred to a group of fans who were at most games, and since those games were all day games, it was assumed they did not work. Many of those fans were, and are still, students at Chicago area colleges, such as DePaul University, Loyola, Northwestern University, and Illinois-Chicago. A Broadway play, starring Joe Mantegna, Dennis Farina, Dennis Franz, and James Belushi ran for years and was based on a group of Cub fans who frequented the club's games. The group was started in 1967 by dedicated fans Ron Grousl, Tom Nall and \"mad bugler\" Mike Murphy, who was a sports radio host during mid days on Chicago-based WSCR AM 670 \"The Score\". Murphy alleges that Grousl started the Wrigley tradition of throwing back opposing teams' home run balls. The current group is headed by <a1_0>Derek Schaul<a1_0/> (Derek the Five Dollar Kid). Prior to the 2006 season, they were updated, with new shops and private bar (The Batter's Eye) being added, and Bud Light bought naming rights to the bleacher section, dubbing them <a2_0>the Bud Light Bleachers<a2_0/>. Bleachers at Wrigley are general admission, except during the playoffs. The bleachers have been referred to as the \"World's Largest Beer Garden.\" A popular T-shirt (sold inside the park and licensed by the club) which says \"Wrigley Bleachers\" on the front and the phrase \"Shut Up and Drink Your Beer\" on the reverse fuels this stereotype."}
