He covered the games with a level of enthusiasm that often seemed unjustified by the team's poor performance on the field for many of those years. His trademark call \"<a1_0>Hey Hey!<a1_0/>\" always followed a home run. That expression is spelled out in large letters vertically on both foul pole screens at Wrigley Field. \"Whoo-boy!\" and \"Wheeee!\" and \"Oh, brother!\" were among his other pet expressions. When he approached retirement age, <a2_0>he personally recommended his successor<a2_0/>."}
