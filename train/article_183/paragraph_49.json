First, Caray had already become a well-known Chicago figure <a1_0>by broadcasting White Sox games for a decade<a1_0/>, after having been a St Louis Cardinals icon for <a2_0>25 years<a2_0/>. Caray also had the benefit of being in the booth during the NL East title run in 1984, which was widely seen due to WGN's status as a cable-TV superstation. His trademark call of \"Holy Cow!\" and his enthusiastic singing of \"Take me out to the ballgame\" during the 7th inning stretch (as he had done with the White Sox) made Caray a fan favorite both locally and nationally."}
