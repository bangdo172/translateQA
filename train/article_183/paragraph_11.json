After the core players of those teams started to move on, <a0_0>the 70s<a0_0/> got worse for the team, and they became known as \"The Loveable Losers.\" In <a2_0>1977<a2_0/>, the team found some life, but ultimately experienced one of its biggest collapses. The Cubs hit a high-water mark on June 28 at 47\u201322, boasting an 8 1\u20442 game NL East lead, as they were led by Bobby Murcer (27 Hr/89 RBI), and Rick Reuschel (20\u201310). However, the Philadelphia Phillies cut the lead to two by the All-star break, as the Cubs sat 19 games over .500, but they swooned late in the season, going 20\u201340 after July 31. The Cubs finished in 4th place at 81\u201381, while Philadelphia surged, finishing with 101 wins. The following two seasons also saw the Cubs get off to a fast start, as the team rallied to over 10 games above .500 well into both seasons, only to again wear down and play poorly later on, and ultimately settling back to mediocrity. This trait became known as the \"June Swoon.\" Again, the Cubs' <a1_0>unusually high number of day games<a1_0/> is often pointed to as one reason for the team's inconsistent late season play."}
