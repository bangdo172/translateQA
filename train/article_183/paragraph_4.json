The White Stockings, with Anson acting as player/manager, captured their third consecutive pennant in <a1_0>1882<a1_0/>, and Anson established himself as the game's first true superstar. In 1885 and '86, after winning N.L. pennants, the White Stockings met the short-lived American Association champion in that era's version of a World Series. Both seasons resulted in match ups with the St. Louis Brown Stockings, with the clubs tying in 1885 and with St. Louis winning in 1886. This was the genesis of what would eventually become one of the greatest rivalries in sports. In all, the Anson-led Chicago Base Ball Club won <a2_0>six<a2_0/> National League pennants between 1876 and 1886. As a result, Chicago's club nickname transitioned, and by 1890 they had become known as the <a3_0>Chicago Colts<a3_0/>, or sometimes \"Anson's Colts\", referring to Cap's influence within the club. <a4_0>Anson<a4_0/> was the first player in history credited with collecting 3,000 career hits. After a disappointing record of 59-73 and a 9th-place finish in 1897, Anson was released by the Cubs as both a player and manager. Due to Anson's absence from the club after 22 years, local newspaper reporters started to refer to the Cubs as the \"Orphans\"."}
