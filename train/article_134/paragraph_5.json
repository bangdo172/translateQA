This often reveals the artist's use of <a1_0><b4_0>carbon black<b4_0/><a1_0/>, which shows up well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting. Art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between \u2013 such alterations are called <a2_0><b5_0><b6_0>pentimenti<b6_0/><b5_0/><a2_0/> when made by the original artist. This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be <b7_0>the prime version.<b7_0/> It also gives useful insights into working practices."}
