These devices usually conform to standards published by IrDA, <a0_0>the Infrared Data Association<a0_0/>. <b8_0>Remote controls and IrDA devices<b8_0/> use infrared <a1_0>light-emitting diodes<a1_0/> (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam. The beam is <a2_0><b5_0>modulated<b5_0/><a2_0/>, i.e. switched on and off, to encode the data. The receiver uses a <a3_0><b6_0>silicon photodiode<b6_0/><a3_0/> to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density. <a4_0>IR does not penetrate walls<a4_0/> and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances. Infrared remote control protocols like <b9_0>RC-5, SIRC<b9_0/>, are used to communicate with infrared."}
