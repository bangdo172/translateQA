The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above <a0_0><b6_0>700<b6_0/> nm<a0_0/> wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. However, particularly intense <a1_0>near-IR<a1_0/> light (e.g., from IR lasers, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately <a2_0>780 nm<a2_0/>, and will be perceived as red light. Sources providing wavelengths as long as <a3_0>1050 nm<a3_0/> can be seen as a dull red glow in intense sources, causing some difficulty in <b7_0>near-IR<b7_0/> illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination). <a4_0><b8_0>Leaves<b8_0/><a4_0/> are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing photographic filter, it is possible to see the Wood effect that consists of IR-glowing foliage."}
