Unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection, <a1_0>thermal radiation<a1_0/> can propagate through a vacuum. Thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object, <b6_0>due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature<b6_0/>. Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength, and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the <a3_0>infrared<a3_0/>, extending into <b7_0>visible, ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions<b7_0/> (i.e., <a2_0><b5_0>the solar corona<b5_0/><a2_0/>).
