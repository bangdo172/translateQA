Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH2) may have <b5_0>multiple<b5_0/> modes of oscillation caused by <b7_0>the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole.<b7_0/> If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then <a1_0>it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency<a1_0/>. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to <a2_0>the frequencies of <b6_0>infrared light<b6_0/><a2_0/>. Typically, the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000\u2013400 cm\u22121, <a3_0>the mid-infrared<a3_0/>. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around <b8_0>3200 cm\u22121<b8_0/>)."}
