Each step in digestion requires <a1_0>energy<a1_0/>, and thus imposes <a2_0>an \"overhead charge\"<a2_0/> on the energy made available from absorbed substances. Differences in that overhead cost are important influences on <a3_0>lifestyle, behavior, and even physical structures<a3_0/>. Examples may be seen in humans, who differ considerably from other hominids (lack of hair, smaller jaws and musculature, different dentition, length of intestines, cooking, etc.)."}
