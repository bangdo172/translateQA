Food is formed into <a1_0>a bolus<a1_0/> by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters <a2_0>the stomach<a2_0/> through the action of <a3_0>peristalsis<a3_0/>. Gastric juice contains <a4_0>hydrochloric acid and pepsin<a4_0/> which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine."}
