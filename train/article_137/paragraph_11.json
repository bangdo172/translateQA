Portions of the outer membrane pinch off<a1_0>, forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials<a1_0/>. Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, <a3_0>some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells<a3_0/>.
