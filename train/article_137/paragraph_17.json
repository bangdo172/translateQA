The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their <a2_0>inactive precursors, the zymogens<a2_0/>. For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin. Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides."}
