In certain organisms, <a1_0>these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream<a1_0/>. Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: <a2_0>mechanical and chemical digestion<a2_0/>. The term mechanical digestion refers to <a3_0>the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes<a3_0/>. In chemical digestion, <a4_0>enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use<a4_0/>."}
