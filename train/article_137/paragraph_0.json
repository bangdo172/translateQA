Saliva, <a1_0>a liquid secreted by the salivary glands<a1_0/>, contains <a2_0>salivary amylase<a2_0/>, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of <a3_0>a small, round slurry mass<a3_0/> called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of <a4_0>peristalsis<a4_0/>. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes."}
