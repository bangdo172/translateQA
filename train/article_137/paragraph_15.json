When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the <a3_0>blood<a3_0/>. 95% of absorption of nutrients occurs in <a4_0>the small intestine<a4_0/>. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9. Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon. Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation."}
