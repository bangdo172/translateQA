There is a fundamental distinction between <a0_0>internal and external digestion<a0_0/>. External digestion developed <a1_0>earlier in evolutionary history<a1_0/>, and <a2_0>most fungi<a2_0/> still rely on it. In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, and some of the products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (<a3_0>gastrointestinal tract<a3_0/>) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because <a4_0>more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled<a4_0/>."}
