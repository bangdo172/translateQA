Such elements as the <a0_0>Agrobacterium Ti or Ri plasmids<a0_0/> contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter <a1_0>the plant cell nucleus<a1_0/> and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of <a2_0>opines<a2_0/>, which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors. <a4_0>The Ti and Ri plasmids<a4_0/> are thus <a3_0>end<a3_0/>osymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant."}
