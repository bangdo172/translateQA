Until then, education in Ireland was largely dominated by religious persuasion, particularly the voluntary secondary school system was a particular realisation of this. The comprehensive school system is still relatively small and to an extent has been superseded by the <a3_0><b8_0>community school<b8_0/><a3_0/> concept. The Irish word for a comprehensive school is a 'scoil chuimsitheach.'"}
