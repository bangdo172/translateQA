For the same reasons, Windows Media Center is not included by default on Windows 8, but Windows Media Center and DVD playback support can be purchased in the \"Pro Pack\" (which <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0>upgrades the system to Windows 8 Pro<b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/>) or \"Media Center Pack\" add-on for Windows 8 Pro. As with prior versions, third-party DVD player software can still be used to enable DVD playback."}
