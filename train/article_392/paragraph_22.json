The term was phased out in August 2012; a Microsoft spokesperson denied rumors that the change was related to a potential trademark issue, and stated that \"Metro\" was only a codename that would be replaced prior to Windows 8's release. Following these reports, the terms \"Modern UI-style apps\", \"Windows 8-style apps\" and \"Windows Store apps\" began to be used by various Microsoft documents and material to refer to the new apps. In an interview on <a3_0><b8_0>September 12, 2012<b8_0/><a3_0/>, Soma Somasegar (<a2_0><b7_0>vice president of Microsoft's development software division<b7_0/><a2_0/>) confirmed that \"Windows Store apps\" would be the official term for the apps. An MSDN page explaining the Metro design language uses the term \"Modern design\" to refer to the language as a whole."}
