The Internet Explorer app does not support plugins or ActiveX components, but includes a version of Adobe Flash Player that is optimized for touch and low power usage. Initially, Adobe Flash would only work on sites included on <a1_0><b6_0>a \"Compatibility View\" whitelist<b6_0/><a1_0/>; however, after feedback from users and additional compatibility tests, an update in March 2013 changed this behavior to use a smaller blacklist of sites with known compatibility issues instead, allowing Flash to be used on <a3_0><b8_0>most sites by default<b8_0/><a3_0/>. The desktop version does not contain these limitations."}
