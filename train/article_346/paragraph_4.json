The Burnside Rules had teams reduced to <b7_0>12 men per side<b7_0/>, introduced the Snap-Back system, required the offensive team to gain 10 yards on three downs, eliminated the Throw-In from the sidelines, allowed only six men on the line, stated that all goals by kicking were to be worth two points and the opposition was to line up 10 yards from the defenders on all kicks. The rules were an attempt to standardize the rules throughout the country. The <a1_0>CIRFU, QRFU and CRU<a1_0/> refused to adopt the new rules at first. Forward passes were not allowed in the Canadian game until <a2_0><b6_0>1929<b6_0/><a2_0/>, and touchdowns, which had been five points, were increased to six points in 1956, in both cases several decades after the Americans had adopted the same changes. The primary differences between the Canadian and <a3_0>American<a3_0/> games stem from <b8_0>rule changes<b8_0/> that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side did not (originally, both sides had three downs, goal posts on the goal lines and unlimited forward motion, but the American side modified these rules and the Canadians did not). The Canadian field width was one rule that was not based on American rules, as the Canadian game played in wider fields and stadiums that were not as narrow as the American stadiums."}
