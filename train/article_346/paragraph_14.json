First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (<b4_0>the <a0_0>ball carrier<b4_0/><a0_0/>). Second, a receiver, that is to say, <b5_0>an offensive player<b5_0/> sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within <a1_0>one yard<a1_0/> of the line of scrimmage (instead of 5 yards (4.6 m) in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not <a2_0><b7_0>hold or trip<b7_0/><a2_0/> the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted <b8_0>after the kick<b8_0/> but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the <a3_0><b6_0>quarterback<b6_0/><a3_0/>, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled."}
