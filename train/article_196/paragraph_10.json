As the pace of development accelerates and populations continue to expand in Southeast Asia, concern has increased regarding the <a4_0>impact of <b7_0>human activity<b7_0/> on the region's environment.<a4_0/> A significant portion of Southeast Asia, however, has not changed greatly and remains an unaltered home to wildlife. The nations of the region, with only few exceptions, have become aware of the need to maintain <b8_0>forest cover<b8_0/> not only to prevent soil erosion but to preserve the diversity of flora and fauna. <a2_0>Indonesia<a2_0/>, for example, has created an extensive system of national parks and preserves for this purpose.
