Osmotic diarrhea can also be the result of maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to <a2_0>alleviate constipation <b6_0>by drawing water into the bowels<b6_0/><a2_0/>). In healthy individuals, <a3_0><b5_0>too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose<b5_0/><a3_0/> can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing <b7_0>lactose<b7_0/> after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products.

Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when offending agent (e.g. milk, sorbitol) is stopped."}
