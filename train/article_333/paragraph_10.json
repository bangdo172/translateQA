Zinc deficiency, a condition often found <b5_0>in children in developing countries<b5_0/> can, even in mild cases, have a significant impact on the development and proper functioning of the human immune system. Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have <b6_0>a <a1_0>greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Similarly, vitamin A deficiency can <a2_0>cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes<a2_0/>, however there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status, <b8_0>others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency<b8_0/>. Given that estimates suggest <a3_0><b7_0>127 million<b7_0/><a3_0/> preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient, this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction."}
