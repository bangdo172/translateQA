Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as <a2_0>Pedialyte<a2_0/>, and relief agencies such as <b7_0>UNICEF<b7_0/> widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of <a3_0>one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added<a3_0/> (approximately the \"taste of tears\"). Rehydration Project recommends adding <b8_0>the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt<b8_0/>, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness.
