These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: <a2_0><b7_0>short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as <a3_0>dysentery<a3_0/>. A number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea, including hyperthyroidism, <b6_0>lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, a number of medications, and irritable bowel syndrome<b6_0/>. In most cases, stool cultures are not required to confirm the exact cause."}
