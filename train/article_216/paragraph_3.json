Despite this, 20 years later <b5_0>John Billingsley<b5_0/> conducted a survey of the county's agriculture in <b8_0>1795<b8_0/> and found that agricultural methods could still be improved. <a2_0>Coal mining was an important industry in north Somerset<a2_0/> during the 18th and 19th centuries, and by <b7_0>1800<b7_0/> it was prominent in Radstock. The Somerset Coalfield reached its peak production by the 1920s, but all the pits have now been closed, the last in 1973. Most of the surface buildings have been removed, and apart from a winding wheel outside Radstock Museum, little evidence of their former existence remains. Further west, the Brendon Hills were mined for <a3_0>iron ore in the late 19th century; this was taken by the <b6_0>West Somerset Mineral Railway<b6_0/> to Watchet Harbour for shipment to the furnaces at Ebbw Vale<a3_0/>."}
