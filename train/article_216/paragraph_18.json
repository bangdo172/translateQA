Quarries at Doulting supplied freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral. Bath stone is also widely used. <a1_0>Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century, as did Hans Price in the <b4_0>19th<b4_0/> century<a1_0/>, but it was used long before then. It was mined underground at <b5_0>Combe Down<b5_0/> and Bathampton Down Mines, and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel, at locations in Wiltshire such as Box. Bath stone is still used on a reduced scale today, but more often as a cladding rather than a structural material. Further south, Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from Ham Hill, which is also widely used in the construction industry. <a2_0>Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for <b8_0>lime mortar and Portland cement<b8_0/><a2_0/>. Until the 1960s, <b7_0>Puriton<b7_0/> had Blue Lias stone quarries, as did several other Polden villages. Its quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball, adjacent to the King's Sedgemoor Drain. Its derelict, early 20th century remains, was removed when the M5 motorway was constructed in the mid-<b6_0>1970s<b6_0/>. Since the 1920s, <a3_0>the county has supplied aggregates. Foster Yeoman is Europe's large supplier of limestone aggregates<a3_0/>, with quarries at Merehead Quarry. It has a dedicated railway operation, Mendip Rail, which is used to transport aggregates by rail from a group of Mendip quarries."}
