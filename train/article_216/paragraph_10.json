They consist of <a1_0>marine clay levels along the coast, and the inland (often peat based) moors<a1_0/>. The Levels are divided into two by <a2_0>the <b8_0>Polden Hills<b8_0/>; land to the south is drained by the River Parrett while land to the north is drained by the River Axe and the River Brue<a2_0/>. <a3_0>The total area of the Levels amounts to about <b6_0>647.5 square kilometres<b6_0/> (<b5_0>160,000<b5_0/> acres)<a3_0/> and broadly corresponds to the administrative district of Sedgemoor but also includes the south west of Mendip district. Approximately 70% of the area is grassland and 30% is arable. Stretching about <b7_0>32 kilometres<b7_0/> (<b9_0>20 mi<b9_0/>) inland, this expanse of flat land barely rises above sea level. Before it was drained, much of the land was under a shallow brackish sea in winter and was marsh land in summer. Drainage began with <a4_0>the Romans, and was restarted at various times: by the Anglo-Saxons<a4_0/>; in the Middle Ages by the Glastonbury Abbey, from 1400\u20131770; and during the Second World War, with the construction of the Huntspill River. Pumping and management of water levels still continues."}
