They were designed to <a1_0>mimic the geometry of \"blacked out\" streets, railway lines, and Bristol Temple Meads railway station, to encourage bombers away from these targets<a1_0/>. One, on the radio beam flight path to Bristol, was constructed on Beacon Batch. It was laid out by <a2_0><b5_0>Shepperton Studios<b5_0/>, based on aerial photographs of the city's railway marshalling yards. The decoys were fitted with dim red lights<a2_0/>, simulating activities like the stoking of steam locomotives. Burning bales of straw soaked in creosote were used to simulate the effects of incendiary bombs dropped by the first wave of Pathfinder night bombers; meanwhile, incendiary bombs dropped on the correct location were quickly smothered, wherever possible. Drums of oil were also ignited to simulate the effect of a blazing city or town, with the aim of fooling subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs on the wrong location. <a3_0>The Chew Magna decoy town was hit by <b4_0><b6_0>half-a-dozen<b6_0/><b4_0/> bombs on 2 December 1940, and over a thousand incendiaries on 3 January 1941<a3_0/>. The following night the Uphill decoy town, protecting <b8_0>Weston-super-Mare's airfield<b8_0/>, was bombed; a herd of dairy cows was hit, killing some and severely injuring others."}
