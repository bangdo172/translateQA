Street developed as a centre for the production of woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, with C. & J. Clark establishing its headquarters in the town. C&J Clark's shoes are no longer manufactured there as <a1_0>the work was transferred to lower-wage areas, such as China and Asia<a1_0/>. Instead, in <b3_0><b4_0>1993<b4_0/><b3_0/>, redundant factory buildings were converted to form <b5_0>Clarks Village<b5_0/>, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the UK. C&J Clark also had shoe factories, at one time at Bridgwater, Minehead, <b6_0>Westfield<b6_0/> and Weston super Mare to provide employment outside the main summer tourist season, but those satellite sites were closed in the late 1980s, before the main site at Street. <a2_0>Dr. Martens shoes were also made in Somerset, by the Northampton-based R. Griggs Group<a2_0/>, using redundant skilled shoemakers from C&J Clark; that work has also been transferred to Asia."}
