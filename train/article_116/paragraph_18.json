But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote <b6_0>beer<b6_0/> as having an undesirably high glycemic index of <a2_0><a3_0>110<a3_0/><a2_0/>, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose."}
