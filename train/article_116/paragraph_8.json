Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character. For example, Dublin has <a1_0>hard water<a1_0/> well-suited to making <b6_0>stout<b6_0/>, such as Guinness; while the Plze\u0148 Region has <a2_0>soft water<a2_0/> well-suited to making <b7_0>Pilsner<b7_0/> (pale lager), such as Pilsner Urquell. The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which benefits making <a4_0>pale ale<a4_0/> to such a degree that brewers of <b8_0>pale ales<b8_0/> will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as <a3_0>Burtonisation<a3_0/>."}
