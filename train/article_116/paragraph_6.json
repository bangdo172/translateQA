Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan that the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a <a1_0><b6_0>blood alcohol concentration<b6_0/><a1_0/> (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an <b7_0>overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability,<b7_0/> decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes <b8_0>lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision.<b8_0/> A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (<a3_0>pulmonary aspiration<a3_0/>) while unconscious and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a <b9_0>coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly <a4_0>fatal alcohol poisoning<b9_0/><a4_0/>. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties against drunk driving."}
