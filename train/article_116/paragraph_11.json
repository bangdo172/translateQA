Hot water (known as \"<a1_0>liquor<a1_0/>\" in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as \"grist\") in a mash tun. <b9_0>The mashing process<b9_0/> takes around <a2_0><b6_0>1 to 2 hours<b6_0/><a2_0/>, during which the starches are converted to <a3_0><b7_0><b10_0>sugars<b10_0/><b7_0/><a3_0/>, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as \"sparging\". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from <b11_0>the wort and sparge water<b11_0/> is called wort separation. The traditional process for <a4_0>wort separation<a4_0/> is <b12_0>lautering<b12_0/>, in which <b8_0>the grain bed<b8_0/> itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist."}
