These beers are termed \"<b5_0>real ale<b5_0/>\" by the CAMRA organisation. Typically, when <b6_0>a <b7_0>cask<b7_0/><b6_0/> arrives in a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a \"<a1_0>stillage<a1_0/>\" which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between 11\u201313 \u00b0C or <a2_0>52\u201355 \u00b0F<a2_0/>), before being tapped and vented\u2014a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to <b8_0>\"drop\"<b8_0/> (clear) again, as well as to fully condition\u2014this period can take anywhere <a3_0>from several hours to several days<a3_0/>. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with <a4_0>a hand pump<a4_0/>, or simply being \"gravity-fed\" directly into the glass."}
