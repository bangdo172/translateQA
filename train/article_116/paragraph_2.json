These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a <b7_0>filter bed<b7_0/> <a3_0>during lautering<a3_0/>, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used.
