The same company had previously made Sink The Bismarck!, a <a4_0>41%<a4_0/> abv IPA, and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of <a3_0>fractional freezing<a3_0/>, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbr\u00e4u's Schorschbock, a 31% abv eisbock, and Hair of the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv barley wine made in <b7_0>1994<b7_0/>, used the same fractional freezing method.
