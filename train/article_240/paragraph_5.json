When the main flow of the Rhine moved south, the old bed, which still flowed through the heart of the town became evermore canalized; and the wharf system was built as an inner city harbour system. On the wharfs storage facilities (werfkelders) were built, on top of which the main street, including houses was constructed. The wharfs and the cellars are accessible from a platform at water level with stairs descending from the street level to form a unique structure.[nb 2] The relations between <a2_0>the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy<a2_0/>. <a3_0>The bishop, for example dammed <b7_0>the Kromme Rijn at Wijk bij Duurstede<b7_0/> to protect his estates from flooding<a3_0/>. This threatened shipping for the city and led the city of Utrecht to commission a canal to ensure access to the town for shipping trade: the Vaartse Rijn, connecting Utrecht to the Hollandse IJssel at IJsselstein."}
