(<b4_0>Cars<b4_0/>, for example, account for 30% of trips). Bicycles are used by young and old people, and by individuals and families. They are mostly traditional, upright, steel-framed bicycles, with few or no gears. <a1_0>There are also barrow bikes, for carrying shopping or small children<a1_0/>. As thousands of bicycles are parked haphazardly in town, creating an eyesore but also impeding pedestrians, the City Council decided <a2_0>in <b6_0>2014<b6_0/> to build <b5_0>the world's largest bicycle parking station<b5_0/>, near the Central Railway Station<a2_0/>. This 3-floor construction will cost an estimated 48 million Euro and will hold 12,500 bicycles. Completion is foreseen in 2018."}
