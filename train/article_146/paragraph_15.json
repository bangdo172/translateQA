About a century after P\u0101\u1e47ini (around 400 BCE), <a3_0>K\u0101ty\u0101yana<a3_0/> composed <b5_0>V\u0101rtikas<b5_0/> on the P\u0101\u1e47ini s\u0169tras. <b6_0>Patanjali<b6_0/>, who lived three centuries after P\u0101\u1e47ini, wrote the <b7_0>Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya<b7_0/>, the \"Great Commentary\" on the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b and V\u0101rtikas. Because of these three ancient Vy\u0101kara\u1e47ins (grammarians), this grammar is called Trimuni Vy\u0101karana. To understand the meaning of the sutras, Jayaditya and V\u0101mana wrote a commentary, the <b8_0>K\u0101sik\u0101<b8_0/>, in 600 CE. P\u0101\u1e47inian grammar is based on 14 Shiva sutras (aphorisms), where the whole <b9_0>m\u0101trika (alphabet)<b9_0/> is abbreviated. This abbreviation is called the <a4_0>Praty\u0101hara<a4_0/>."}
