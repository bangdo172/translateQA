Though they are quite similar, they differ in a number of essential points of phonology, vocabulary, grammar and syntax. Vedic Sanskrit is the language of <a3_0>the Vedas<a3_0/>, a large collection of hymns, incantations (Samhitas) and theological and religio-philosophical discussions in the Brahmanas and Upanishads. Modern linguists consider the <b12_0>metrical hymns<b12_0/> of the <a4_0><b13_0>Rigveda Samhita<b13_0/><a4_0/> to be the earliest, composed by many authors over several centuries of oral tradition.
