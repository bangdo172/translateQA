These include Harvard-Kyoto and <a4_0><b9_0>ITRANS<b9_0/><a4_0/>, a transliteration scheme that is used widely on the Internet, especially in Usenet and in email, for considerations of speed of entry as well as rendering issues. With the wide availability of Unicode-aware web browsers, IAST has become common online.
