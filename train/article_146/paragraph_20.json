According to Thomas Trautmann, after this period of \"Indomania\", a certain hostility to <b6_0>Sanskrit<b6_0/> and to Indian culture in general began to assert itself in <a1_0>early 19th century<a1_0/> Britain, manifested by a <a2_0>neglect<a2_0/> of Sanskrit in <b7_0>British academia<b7_0/>. This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be <b8_0>culturally, religiously and linguistically<b8_0/> <a3_0>assimilated to Britain<a3_0/> as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was \"British Indophobia\", which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was <b9_0>scientific racism<b9_0/>, a theory of the English \"common-sense view\" that Indians constituted a \"separate, <a4_0>inferior<a4_0/> and unimprovable race\"."}
