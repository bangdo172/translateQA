Richard's policy on the continent was to attempt to regain through steady, limited campaigns the castles he had lost to Philip II whilst on crusade. He allied himself with the leaders of Flanders, Boulogne and the Holy Roman Empire to apply pressure on Philip from Germany. In <a0_0>1195<a0_0/> John successfully conducted a sudden attack and siege of \u00c9vreux castle, and subsequently managed the defences of Normandy against Philip. The following year, John seized the town of Gamaches and led a raiding party within 50 miles (80 km) of Paris, capturing the Bishop of Beauvais. In return for this service, Richard withdrew his <a1_0>malevolentia<a1_0/> (ill-will) towards <a2_0>John<a2_0/>, restored him to the county of Gloucestershire and made him again the Count of Mortain."}
