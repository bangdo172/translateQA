One group was the familiares regis, John's immediate friends and knights who travelled around the country with him. They also played an important role in organising and leading military campaigns. Another section of royal followers were the curia regis; these curiales were the <a1_0>senior officials and agents of the king<a1_0/> and were essential to his day-to-day rule. Being a member of these inner circles brought huge advantages, as it was easier to gain favours from the king, file lawsuits, marry a wealthy heiress or have one's debts remitted. By the time of Henry II, these posts were increasingly being filled by \"new men\" from outside the normal ranks of the barons. This intensified under John's rule, with many lesser nobles arriving from the continent to take up positions at court; many were mercenary leaders from Poitou. These men included soldiers who would become infamous in England for <a2_0>their uncivilised behaviour<a2_0/>, including Falkes de Breaut\u00e9, Geard d'Athies, Engelard de Cigong\u00e9 and Philip Marc. Many barons perceived the king's household as what Ralph Turner has characterised as a \"narrow clique enjoying royal favour at barons' expense\" staffed by men of lesser status."}
