Eleanor then left for <a0_0>Poitiers<a0_0/>, the capital of Aquitaine, and sent John and his sister Joan north to Fontevrault Abbey. This may have been done with the aim of steering her youngest son, with no obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career. Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John's very early life. John was probably, like his brothers, assigned a <a2_0>magister<a2_0/> whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with his early education and with managing the servants of his immediate household; John was later taught by <a1_0>Ranulph Glanville<a1_0/>, a leading English administrator. John spent some time as a member of the household of his eldest living brother Henry the Young King, where he probably received instruction in hunting and military skills."}
