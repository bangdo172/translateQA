Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in <a0_0>1202<a0_0/>, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that he need not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the <a1_0>Count of Poitou<a1_0/>, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur \u2013 with the exception of Normandy, which he took back for himself \u2013 and began a fresh war against John."}
