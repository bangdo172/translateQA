Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. Joan married <a1_0>Alexander II of Scotland<a1_0/> to become his queen consort. Isabella married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort.
