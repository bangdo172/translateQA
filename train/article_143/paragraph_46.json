Historian <a1_0>Jim Bradbury<a1_0/> has summarised the contemporary historical opinion of John's positive qualities, observing that John is today usually considered a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\". Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\", such as pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty. These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the Victorian era, and John remains a recurring character within <a2_0>Western<a2_0/> popular culture, primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the Robin Hood legends."}
