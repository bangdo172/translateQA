Jim Bradbury notes the current consensus that John was a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\", albeit, as Turner suggests, with \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\", including pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty. John Gillingham, author of a major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John <a2_0>a less effective general<a2_0/> than do Turner or Warren, and describes him \"one of the worst kings ever to rule England\". Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards <a1_0>John's numerous faults<a1_0/>. Popular historian Frank McLynn maintains a counter-revisionist perspective on John, arguing that the king's modern reputation amongst historians is \"bizarre\", and that as a monarch John \"fails almost all those [tests] that can be legitimately set\"."}
