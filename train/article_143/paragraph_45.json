The anonymous play The Troublesome Reign of King John portrayed the king as a \"<a2_0>proto-Protestant martyr<a2_0/>\", similar to that shown in John Bale's morality play Kynge Johan, in which John attempts to save England from the \"evil agents of the Roman Church\". By contrast, Shakespeare's King John, a relatively anti-Catholic play that draws on The Troublesome Reign for its source material, offers a more \"balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler\". Anthony Munday's play <a1_0>The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington<a1_0/> portrays many of John's negative traits, but adopts a positive interpretation of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic Church, in line with the contemporary views of the Tudor monarchs. By the middle of the 17th century, plays such as Robert Davenport's King John and Matilda, although based largely on the earlier Elizabethan works, were transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons and focusing more on the tyrannical aspects of John's behaviour."}
