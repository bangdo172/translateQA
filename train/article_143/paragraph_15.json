As part of the deal, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a feudal service of <a1_0>1,000<a1_0/> marks (equivalent to \u00a3666 at the time) annually: 700 marks (\u00a3466) for England and 300 marks (\u00a3200) for Ireland, as well as recompensing the church for revenue lost during the crisis. The agreement was formalised in the <a2_0>Bulla Aurea<a2_0/>, or Golden Bull. This resolution produced mixed responses. Although some chroniclers felt that John had been humiliated by the sequence of events, there was little public reaction. Innocent benefited from the resolution of his long-standing English problem, but John probably gained more, as Innocent became a firm supporter of John for the rest of his reign, backing him in both domestic and continental policy issues. Innocent immediately turned against Philip, calling upon him to reject plans to invade England and to sue for peace. John paid some of the compensation money he had promised the church, but he ceased making payments in late 1214, leaving two-thirds of the sum unpaid; Innocent appears to have conveniently forgotten this debt for the good of the wider relationship."}
