Kate Norgate, for example, argued that John's downfall had been due not to his failure in war or strategy, but due to his \"almost superhuman wickedness\", whilst <a0_0>James Ramsay<a0_0/> blamed John's family background and his cruel personality for his downfall. Historians in the \"Whiggish\" tradition, focusing on documents such as the <a1_0>Domesday Book and Magna Carta<a1_0/>, trace a progressive and universalist course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period. These historians were often inclined to see John's reign, and his signing of Magna Carta in particular, as a positive step in the constitutional development of England, despite the flaws of the king himself. Winston Churchill, for example, argued that \"[w]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns\"."}
