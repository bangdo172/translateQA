John was optimistic, as he had successfully built up alliances with the <a1_0>Emperor Otto, Renaud of Boulogne and Count Ferdinand of Flanders<a1_0/>; he was enjoying papal favour; and he had successfully built up substantial funds to pay for the deployment of his experienced army. Nonetheless, when John left for Poitou in <a2_0>February 1214<a2_0/>, many barons refused to provide military service; mercenary knights had to fill the gaps. John's plan was to split Philip's forces by pushing north-east from Poitou towards Paris, whilst Otto, Renaud and Ferdinand, supported by William Longesp\u00e9e, marched south-west from Flanders."}
