Revisionist histories written by John Foxe, William Tyndale and Robert Barnes portrayed John as an early Protestant hero, and John Foxe included the king in his Book of Martyrs. <a2_0>John Speed's Historie of Great Britaine<a2_0/> in 1632 praised John's \"great renown\" as a king; he blamed the bias of medieval chroniclers for the king's poor reputation."}
