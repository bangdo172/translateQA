The available evidence suggests that John did not regard the loss of the Duchy as a permanent shift in <a1_0>Capetian power<a1_0/>. Strategically, John faced several challenges: England itself had to be secured against possible French invasion, the sea-routes to Bordeaux needed to be secured following the loss of the land route to Aquitaine, and his remaining possessions in Aquitaine needed to be secured following the death of his mother, Eleanor, in April 1204. John's preferred plan was to <a2_0>use Poitou as a base of operations<a2_0/>, advance up the Loire valley to threaten Paris, pin down the French forces and break Philip's internal lines of communication before landing a maritime force in the Duchy itself. Ideally, this plan would benefit from the opening of a second front on Philip's eastern frontiers with Flanders and Boulogne \u2013 effectively a re-creation of Richard's old strategy of applying pressure from Germany. All of this would require a great deal of money and soldiers."}
