John took a close interest in <a0_0>Wales<a0_0/> and knew the country well, visiting every year between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter, Joan, to the Welsh prince <a1_0>Llywelyn the Great<a1_0/>. The king used the <a2_0>marcher lords and the native Welsh<a2_0/> to increase his own territory and power, striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals backed by royal military power with the Welsh rulers. A major royal expedition to enforce these agreements occurred in <a3_0>1211<a3_0/>, after Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the removal of William de Braose, through the Welsh uprising of 1211. John's invasion, striking into the Welsh heartlands, was a military success. Llywelyn came to terms that included an expansion of John's power across much of Wales, albeit only temporarily."}
