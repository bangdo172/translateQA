John's predecessors had ruled using the principle of <a0_0>vis et voluntas<a0_0/>, or \"force and will\", taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions, often justified on the basis that a king was above the law. Both Henry II and Richard had argued that kings possessed a quality of \"<a1_0>divine majesty<a1_0/>\"; John continued this trend and claimed an \"almost imperial status\" for himself as ruler. During the <a2_0>12th century<a2_0/>, there were contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship, and many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law, and take counsel of the leading members of the realm. There was as yet no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so. Despite his claim to unique authority within England, John would sometimes justify his actions on the basis that he had taken council with the barons. Modern historians remain divided as to whether John suffered from a case of \"<a3_0>royal schizophrenia<a3_0/>\" in his approach to government, or if his actions merely reflected the complex model of Angevin kingship in the early 13th century."}
