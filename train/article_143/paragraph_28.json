The most infamous case, which went beyond anything considered acceptable at the time, proved to be that of William de Braose, a powerful marcher lord with lands in Ireland. De Braose was subjected to punitive demands for money, and when he refused to pay a huge sum of <a2_0>40,000<a2_0/> marks (equivalent to \u00a326,666 at the time),[nb 13] his wife and one of his sons were imprisoned by John, which resulted in their deaths.

John's suspicions and jealousies meant that he rarely enjoyed good relationships with even the leading loyalist barons."}
