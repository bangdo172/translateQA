The original concept is derived from a pre-Islamic Persian prototype <a1_0><b7_0>Hez\u0101r Afs\u0101n<b7_0/> (Thousand Fables)<a1_0/> that relied on particular Indian elements. It reached its final form by the <a2_0>14th century<a2_0/>; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another. All Arabian fantasy tales tend to be called Arabian Nights stories when translated into <b8_0>English<b8_0/>, regardless of whether they appear in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights or not. This work has been very influential in the West since it was translated in the <a3_0>18th century<a3_0/>, first by <a4_0>Antoine Galland<a4_0/>. Imitations were written, especially in France. Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad the Sailor and Ali Baba."}
