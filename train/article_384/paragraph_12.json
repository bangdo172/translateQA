The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. <a2_0>Ibn al-Haytham<a2_0/> is also regarded as the father of optics, especially for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light. Some have also described Ibn al-Haytham as the \"first scientist.\" <a3_0>al-Khwarzimi<a3_0/>'s invented the log base systems that are being used today, he also contributed theorems in trigonometry as well as limits.
