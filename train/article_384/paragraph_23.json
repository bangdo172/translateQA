Such designs are highly nonrepresentational, as Islam forbids <b5_0>representational depictions<b5_0/> as found in <a1_0>pre-Islamic pagan religions<a1_0/>. Despite this, there is a presence of depictional art in some <b6_0>Muslim societies<b6_0/>, notably the miniature style made famous in <b8_0>Persia<b8_0/> and under the Ottoman Empire which featured paintings of <a2_0>people and animals<a2_0/>, and also depictions of Quranic stories and Islamic traditional narratives. Another reason why Islamic art is usually abstract is <a4_0>to symbolize <b7_0>the transcendence, indivisible and infinite nature of God<a4_0/>,<b7_0/> an objective achieved by arabesque. Islamic calligraphy is an omnipresent decoration in Islamic art, and is usually expressed in the form of Quranic verses. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic <a3_0>kufic and naskh scripts<a3_0/>, which can be found adorning the walls and domes of mosques, the sides of minbars, and so on."}
