The industrial uses of <b5_0>watermills<b5_0/> in the Islamic world date back to the <a0_0>7th century<a0_0/>, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the <a1_0>9th century<a1_0/>. A variety of industrial mills were being employed in the Islamic world, including early fulling mills, gristmills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, tide mills and windmills. By the <a2_0>11th century<a2_0/>, <b6_0>every province throughout the Islamic world<b6_0/> had these industrial mills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. <a3_0><a4_0><b8_0>Muslim engineers<b8_0/><a4_0/><a3_0/> also invented crankshafts and water turbines, employed gears in mills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. Such advances made it possible for industrial tasks that were previously driven by manual labour in ancient times to be mechanized and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. The transfer of these technologies to medieval Europe had an influence on the <b7_0>Industrial Revolution<b7_0/>."}
