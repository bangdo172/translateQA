Most verbs come in <b4_0>pairs<b4_0/>, with the perfective verb being created out of <b5_0>the imperfective<b5_0/> by adding a prefix or making a stem change. The <a0_0>imperfective<a0_0/> aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished, in progress, or repetitive; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the <a2_0>action was completed, instantaneous, or of limited duration<a2_0/>. Some \u0160tokavian tenses (namely, aorist and imperfect) favor <b6_0>a particular aspect<b6_0/> (but they are rarer or absent in \u010cakavian and Kajkavian). Actually, aspects \"compensate\" for <b7_0>the relative lack of tenses<b7_0/>, because aspect of the verb determines whether the act is completed or in progress in the referred time."}
