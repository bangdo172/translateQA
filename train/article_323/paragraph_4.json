In 1850 <b7_0>Serbian and Croatian writers and linguists<b7_0/> signed the <a2_0>Vienna Literary Agreement<a2_0/>, declaring <b8_0>their intention to create a unified standard<b8_0/>. Thus a complex bi-variant language appeared, which the Serbs officially called \"Serbo-Croatian\" or \"Serbian or Croatian\" and the Croats \"Croato-Serbian\", or \"Croatian or Serbian\". Yet, in practice, the variants of the conceived common literary language served as different literary variants, chiefly differing in lexical inventory and stylistic devices. The common phrase describing this situation was that Serbo-Croatian or \"Croatian or Serbian\" was a single language. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the language of all three nations was called \"Bosnian\" until the death of <a3_0>administrator von K\u00e1llay<a3_0/> in 1907, at which point the name was changed to \"Serbo-Croatian\"."}
