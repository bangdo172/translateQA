They also have two numbers: <b4_0>singular and plural<b4_0/>. However, some consider there to be three numbers (paucal or dual, too), since (still preserved in closely related Slovene) after two (dva, dvije/dve), three (tri) and four (\u010detiri), and all numbers ending in them (e.g. twenty-two, ninety-three, one hundred four) the genitive singular is used, and after all other numbers five (pet) and up, the genitive plural is used. (The number <a2_0>one [jedan]<a2_0/> is treated as <b5_0>an adjective<b5_0/>.) Adjectives are placed <a1_0><b6_0>in front of the noun they modify<b6_0/><a1_0/> and <b7_0>must agree<b7_0/> in both case and number with it."}
