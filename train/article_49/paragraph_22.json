In <a3_0>1766<a3_0/>, <a2_0>Henry Cavendish<a2_0/> was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction \"flammable air\". He speculated that \"flammable air\" was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called \"phlogiston\" and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces <a4_0>water<a4_0/> when burned. He is usually given credit for its discovery as an element. In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen (from the Greek \u1f51\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf- hydro meaning \"water\" and -\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2 genes meaning \"creator\") when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned."}
