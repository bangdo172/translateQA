He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December <a2_0>1931<a2_0/> by <a3_0>Harold Urey<a3_0/>, and tritium was prepared in <a4_0>1934<a4_0/> by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. Fran\u00e7ois Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The D\u00f6bereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823."}
