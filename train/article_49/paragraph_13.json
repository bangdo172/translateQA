The term \"hydride\" suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H\u2212, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element. The existence of the hydride anion, suggested by <a0_0>Gilbert N. Lewis<a0_0/> in 1916 for group I and II salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten lithium hydride (LiH), producing a stoichiometry quantity of hydrogen at the anode. For hydrides other than group I and II metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in <a1_0>group II<a1_0/> hydrides is BeH\n2, which is polymeric. In lithium aluminium hydride, the AlH\u2212\n4 anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III)."}
