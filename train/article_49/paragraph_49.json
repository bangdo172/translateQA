It is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding. H2 is used <a1_0>as the rotor coolant<a1_0/> in electrical generators at power stations, because <a2_0>it has the highest thermal conductivity of any gas<a2_0/>. Liquid H2 is used in <a3_0>cryogenic<a3_0/> research, including superconductivity studies. Because H\n2 is lighter than air, having a little more than 1\u204414 of the density of air, it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships."}
