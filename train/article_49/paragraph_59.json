Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on <a0_0>the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio<a0_0/> (it often takes <a1_0>days or weeks<a1_0/> at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the <a2_0>container geometry<a2_0/>."}
