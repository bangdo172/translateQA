Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electro<a1_0>negative<a1_0/>, such as halogens (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), or oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial <a0_0>positive charge<a0_0/>. When bonded to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with other similar molecules between their hydrogens called hydrogen bonding, which is critical to the stability of many biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as the metals and metalloids, in which it takes on a partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as <a2_0>hydrides<a2_0/>."}
