The largest application of H\n2 is for the processing (\"upgrading\") of fossil fuels, and in the production of ammonia. The key consumers of H\n2 in the petrochemical plant include <a1_0>hydrodealkylation, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrocracking<a1_0/>. H\n2 has several other important uses. H\n2 is used as a hydrogenating agent, particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and oils (found in items such as margarine), and in the production of methanol. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid. H\n2 is also used as a reducing agent of metallic ores."}
