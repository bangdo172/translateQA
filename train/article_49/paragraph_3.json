Most hydrogen is employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., <a1_0>hydrocracking<a1_0/>) and ammonia production, mostly for <a0_0>the fertilizer market<a0_0/>. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks."}
