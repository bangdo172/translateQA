Furthermore, the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation H+\n2 allowed fuller understanding of the nature of the chemical bond, which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid-<a2_0>1920s<a2_0/>."}
