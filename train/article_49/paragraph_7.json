However, the electromagnetic force attracts <a2_0>electrons and protons<a2_0/> to one another, while planets and celestial objects are attracted to each other by <a1_0>gravity<a1_0/>. Because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies."}
