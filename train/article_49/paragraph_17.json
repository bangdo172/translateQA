{"qas": [{"question": "What is another term for a bare proton?", "id": "56e09d01231d4119001ac2d3", "answers": [{"text": "H+", "answer_start": 15}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "A bare proton, <a0_0>H+<a0_0/>, cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals, because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from the electron clouds of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted \"H+\" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species."}
