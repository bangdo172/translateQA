This charged ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet <a2_0>Jupiter<a2_0/>. The ion is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density. H+\n3 is one of the most abundant ions in the Universe, and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Neutral triatomic hydrogen H3 can only exist in an <a3_0>excited form<a3_0/> and is unstable. By contrast, the positive hydrogen molecular ion (H+\n2) is a rare molecule in the universe."}
