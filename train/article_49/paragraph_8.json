The most complicated treatments allow for the small effects of special relativity and vacuum polarization. In the quantum mechanical treatment, the electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no <a0_0>angular<a0_0/> momentum at all\u2014an illustration of how the \"planetary orbit\" conception of electron motion differs from reality."}
