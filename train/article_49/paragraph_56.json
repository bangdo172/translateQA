These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs <a1_0>in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water<a1_0/>. The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the <a2_0>hydrogen cycle<a2_0/>."}
