During the early study of radioactivity, various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names, but such names are no longer used, except for <a1_0>deuterium and tritium<a1_0/>. The symbols <a2_0>D and T<a2_0/> (instead of <a4_0>2H and 3H<a4_0/>) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the corresponding symbol for protium, P, is already in use for <a3_0>phosphorus<a3_0/> and thus is not available for protium. In its nomenclatural guidelines, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry allows any of D, T, 2H, and 3H to be used, although 2H and 3H are preferred."}
