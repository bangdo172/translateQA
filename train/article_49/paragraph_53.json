The Sun's energy comes from <a1_0>nuclear fusion of hydrogen<a1_0/>, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources require more energy to make it than is obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an <a2_0>energy carrier<a2_0/>, like a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable."}
