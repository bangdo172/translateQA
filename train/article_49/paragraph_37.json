The process also produces <a1_0>alumina<a1_0/>, but <a2_0>the expensive gallium<a2_0/>, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported."}
