In the orthohydrogen form, the spins of the two protons are parallel and form a <a1_0>triplet state<a1_0/> with a molecular spin quantum number of 1 (1\u2044<a0_0>2<a0_0/>+1\u20442); in the parahydrogen form the spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular spin quantum number of 0 (1\u20442\u20131\u20442). At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas contains about <a3_0>25%<a3_0/> of the para form and <a4_0>75%<a4_0/> of the ortho form, also known as the \"<a2_0>normal<a2_0/> form\". The equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature, but because the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form, it is unstable and cannot be purified. At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen. The ortho/para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups, such as water and methylene, but is of little significance for their thermal properties."}
