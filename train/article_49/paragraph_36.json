A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the <a1_0>anode<a1_0/> while gaseous hydrogen forms at the <a2_0>cathode<a2_0/>. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80\u201394%."}
