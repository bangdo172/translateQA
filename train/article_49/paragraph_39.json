This is because high-pressure H\n2 is the most marketable product and Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) purification systems work better at higher pressures. The product mixture is known as \"synthesis gas\" because it is often used directly for the <a1_0>production of methanol<a1_0/> and related compounds. <a2_0>Hydrocarbons<a2_0/> other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios.
