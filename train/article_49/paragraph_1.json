At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a <a2_0>colorless, odorless, tasteless<a2_0/>, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the <a0_0>molecular<a0_0/> formula <a1_0>H2<a1_0/>. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid\u2013base reactions as many acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a <a3_0>negative<a3_0/> charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest. As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of <a4_0>quantum mechanics<a4_0/>."}
