It largely avoided Keynesian pump-priming and pursued a more <b8_0>conservative fiscal policy of debt reduction and balanced budgets<b8_0/> as a means of stewarding Australia out of the Depression. <a2_0><b6_0>Lyons' death in 1939<b6_0/><a2_0/> saw Robert Menzies assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of war.

The UAP, led by Billy Hughes, disintegrated after suffering a heavy defeat in the 1943 election."}
