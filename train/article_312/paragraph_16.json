A significant program of economic reform however was not pursued. By 1983, the Australian economy was suffering with the early 1980s recession and amidst the effects of <a1_0><b5_0>a severe drought<b5_0/><a1_0/>. Fraser had promoted \"states' rights\" and his government refused to use Commonwealth powers to stop the construction of the Franklin Dam in Tasmania in 1982. Liberal minister, Don Chipp split off from the party to form a new social liberal party, the <a2_0><b6_0>Australian Democrats<b6_0/><a2_0/> in 1977. Fraser won further substantial majorities at the 1977 and 1980 elections, before losing to the <a3_0><b7_0>Bob Hawke<b7_0/><a3_0/> led Australian Labor Party in the 1983 election."}
