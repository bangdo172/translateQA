The far East, a phrase containing a noun, East, qualified by an adjective, far, could be at any location in the \"far east\" of the speaker's home territory. The Ottoman Empire, for example, was the far East as much as the East Indies. <a1_0>The Crimean War<a1_0/> brought a change in vocabulary with the introduction of terms more familiar to the late 19th century. The Russian Empire had entered a more aggressive phase, becoming militarily active against <a2_0>the Ottoman Empire<a2_0/> and also against China, with territorial aggrandizement explicitly in mind. Rethinking its policy <a3_0>the British government<a3_0/> decided that the two polities under attack were necessary for the balance of power. It therefore undertook to oppose the Russians in both places, one result being the Crimean War. During that war the administration of <a4_0>the British Empire<a4_0/> began promulgating a new vocabulary, giving specific regional meaning to \"the Near East,\" the Ottoman Empire, and \"the Far East,\" the East Indies. The two terms were now compound nouns often shown hyphenated."}
