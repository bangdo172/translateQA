Instead the Normans whirled off to <a0_0>New York<a0_0/>. Norman published the gist of his planned travel book curiously mixed with vituperation against the Ottoman Empire in an article in <a1_0>June, 1896<a1_0/>, in <a2_0>Scribner's Magazine<a2_0/>. The empire had descended from an enlightened civilization ruling over barbarians for their own good to something considerably less. The difference was the Hamidian Massacres, which were being conducted even as the couple traveled the Balkans. According to Norman now, the empire had been established by \"the Moslem horde\" from Asia, which was stopped by \"intrepid Hungary.\" Furthermore, \"Greece shook off the turbaned destroyer of her people\" and so on. <a3_0>The Russians<a3_0/> were suddenly liberators of oppressed Balkan states. Having portrayed the Armenians as revolutionaries in the name of freedom with the expectation of being rescued by the intervention of Christian Europe, he states \"but her hope was vain.\" <a4_0>England<a4_0/> had \"turned her back.\" Norman concluded his exhortation with \"In the Balkans one learns to hate the Turk.\" Norman made sure that Gladstone read the article. Prince Nicolas of Montenegro wrote a letter thanking him for his article."}
