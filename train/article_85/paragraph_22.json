In 1894, Sir Henry Norman, 1st Baronet, a journalist, travelled to <a1_0>the Far East<a1_0/>, afterwards writing a book called <a2_0>The Peoples and Politics of the Far East<a2_0/>, which came out in <a3_0>1895<a3_0/>. By \"Far East\" he meant Siberia, China, Japan, Korea, Siam and Malaya. As the book was a big success, he was off to the Balkan states with his wife in 1896 to develop detail for a sequel, The People and Politics of the Near East, which Scribners planned to publish in 1897. Mrs. Norman, a writer herself, wrote glowing letters of the home and person of Mme. Zakki, \"the wife of a Turkish cabinet minister,\" who, she said, was a cultivated woman living in a country home full of books. As for the natives of the Balkans, they were \"a semi-civilized people.\""}
