The Ottomans were portrayed as <a0_0>the slavers<a0_0/>, but even as the American and British fleets were striking at the Barbary pirates on behalf of freedom, their countries were promulgating a vigorous African slave trade of their own. <a1_0>Charles George Gordon<a1_0/> is known as the saint of all British colonial officers. A dedicated Christian, he spent his time between <a2_0>assignments living among the poor and donating his salary<a2_0/> on their behalf. He won Ottoman confidence <a3_0>as a junior officer in the Crimean War<a3_0/>. In his later career he became <a4_0>a high official in the Ottoman Empire<a4_0/>, working as Governor of Egypt for the Ottoman khedive for the purpose of conducting campaigns against slavers and slavery in Egypt and the Sudan."}
