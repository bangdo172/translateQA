In essence, he <a2_0>signed the death warrant, so to speak, of the Age of Empires<a2_0/>. The fall of the Ottoman Empire ultimately enmeshed all the others as well. In the Travel and Politics in the Near East, 1898, Miller claimed to have made four trips to the Balkans, 1894, 1896, 1897 and 1898, and to be, in essence, an expert on \"the Near East,\" by which he primarily meant the Balkans. Apart from the fact that he attended <a3_0>Oxford<a3_0/> and played Rugby not many biographical details have been promulgated. He was in effect (whatever his formal associations if any) a point man of British near eastern intelligence."}
