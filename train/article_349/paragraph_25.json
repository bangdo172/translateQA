Gaddafi was indiscriminate in the causes he funded, sometimes switching from supporting one side in a conflict to the other, as in the <a0_0>Eritrean War of Independence<a0_0/>. Throughout the <a1_0>1970s<a1_0/> these groups received financial support from Libya, which came to be seen as a leader in the Third World's struggle against <a2_0>colonialism and neocolonialism<a2_0/>. Though many of these groups were labelled \"terrorists\" by critics of their activities, Gaddafi rejected such a characterisation, instead considering them revolutionaries engaged in liberation struggles."}
