In February 1978, Gaddafi discovered that his <a1_0>head of military intelligence<a1_0/> was plotting to kill him, and began to increasingly entrust security to his <a0_0>Qaddadfa<a0_0/> tribe. Many who had seen their wealth and property confiscated turned against the administration, and a number of western-funded opposition groups were founded by exiles. Most prominent was the <a2_0>National Front for the Salvation of Libya<a2_0/> (NFSL), founded in 1981 by <a3_0>Mohammed Magariaf<a3_0/>, which orchestrated militant attacks against Libya's government, while another, <a4_0>al-Borkan,<a4_0/> began killing Libyan diplomats abroad. Following Gaddafi's command to kill these \"stray dogs\", under Colonel Younis Bilgasim's leadership, the Revolutionary Committees set up overseas branches to suppress counter-revolutionary activity, assassinating various dissidents. Although nearby nations like Syria also used hit squads, Gaddafi was unusual in publicly bragging about his administration's use of them; in June 1980, he ordered all dissidents to return home or be \"liquidated wherever you are.\""}
