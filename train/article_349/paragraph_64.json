He believed that the state of Israel should not exist, and that any Arab compromise with the Israeli government was a betrayal of the Arab people. In large part due to their <a3_0>support of Israel<a3_0/>, Gaddafi despised the <a0_0>United States<a0_0/>, considering the country to be imperialist and lambasting it as \"the embodiment of evil.\" Rallying against Jews in many of his speeches, his anti-Semitism has been described as \"almost Hitlerian\" by <a2_0>Blundy and Lycett<a2_0/>. From the late 1990s onward, his view seemed to become more moderate. In 2007, he advocated the <a1_0>Isratin single-state solution<a1_0/> to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, stating that \"the [Israel-Palestine] solution is to establish a democratic state for the Jews and the Palestinians... This is the fundamental solution, or else the Jews will be annihilated in the future, because the Palestinians have [strategic] depth.\" Two years later he argued that a single-state solution would \"move beyond old conflicts and look to a unified future based on shared culture and respect.\""}
