In doing so, they tried discrediting tribal leaders as agents of the old regime, and in August 1971 a <a3_0>Sabha<a3_0/> military court tried many of them for <a2_0>counter-revolutionary activity<a2_0/>. Long-standing administrative boundaries were re-drawn, crossing tribal boundaries, while pro-revolutionary modernizers replaced traditional leaders, but the communities they served often rejected them. Realizing the failures of the modernizers, Gaddafi created the <a4_0>Arab Socialist Union<a4_0/> (ASU), a mass mobilization vanguard party of which he was president. The ASU recognized the RCC as its \"Supreme Leading Authority\", and was designed to further revolutionary enthusiasm throughout the country."}
