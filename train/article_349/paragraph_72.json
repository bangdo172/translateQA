Supporters praised Gaddafi's administration for the creation of an almost classless society through domestic reform. They stress the regime's achievements in combating homelessness and ensuring access to food and safe drinking water. Highlighting that under Gaddafi, all Libyans enjoyed <a1_0>free<a1_0/> education to a university level, they point to the dramatic rise in literacy rates after the 1969 revolution. Supporters have also applauded achievements in medical care, praising the universal free healthcare provided under the Gaddafist administration, with diseases like <a0_0>cholera and typhoid<a0_0/> being contained and life expectancy raised. Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed that under the first decade of Gaddafi's leadership, life for most Libyans \"undoubtedly changed for the better\" as material conditions and wealth drastically improved, while <a4_0>Libyan studies specialist<a4_0/> Lillian Craig Harris remarked that in the early years of his administration, Libya's \"national wealth and international influence soared, and its national standard of living has risen dramatically.\" Such high standards declined during the 1980s, as a result of <a2_0>economic stagnation<a2_0/>. Gaddafi claimed that his Jamahiriya was a \"concrete utopia\", and that he had been appointed by \"popular assent\", with some Islamic supporters believing that he exhibited barakah. His opposition to Western governments earned him the respect of many in the <a3_0>Euro-American far right<a3_0/>."}
