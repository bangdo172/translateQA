From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 joined the <a0_0>Community of Sahel-Saharan States<a0_0/>. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in <a1_0>Algiers<a1_0/>, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became one of the founders of the <a2_0>African Union<a2_0/> (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he proclaimed that African states should reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President <a4_0>Thabo Mbeki<a4_0/>. At the third AU summit, held in Libya in July 2005, he called for a greater level of integration, advocating a single AU passport, a common defence system and a single currency, utilising the slogan: \"The United States of Africa is the hope.\" In June 2005, Libya joined the <a3_0>Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa<a3_0/> (COMESA), and in August 2008 Gaddafi was proclaimed \"King of Kings\" by an assembled committee of traditional African leaders. On 1 February 2009, his \"coronation ceremony\" was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, coinciding with Gaddafi's election as AU chairman for a year."}
