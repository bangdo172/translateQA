In 1987, Libya began production of <a1_0>mustard gas<a1_0/> at a facility in <a2_0>Rabta<a2_0/>, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalised army initiated a failed coup in <a3_0>Misrata<a3_0/>, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in <a4_0>Benghazi<a4_0/>, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists."}
