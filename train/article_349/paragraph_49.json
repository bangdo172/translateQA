Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus <a1_0>11<a1_0/> people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans \u2013 <a2_0>Abdelbaset al-Megrahi<a2_0/> and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah \u2013 as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution <a3_0>748<a3_0/> in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated <a4_0>$900 million<a4_0/> financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the west when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the U.S. off the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticising them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela."}
