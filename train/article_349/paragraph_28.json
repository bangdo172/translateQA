Operating in a <a3_0>pyramid<a3_0/> structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the <a2_0>General People's Committee<a2_0/>. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions."}
