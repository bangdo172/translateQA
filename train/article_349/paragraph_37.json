Within a year he was backtracking, announcing that sharia was inappropriate for the Jamahiriya because it guaranteed the <a1_0>protection of private property<a1_0/>, contravening The Green Book's socialism. His emphasis on placing his own work on a par with the Qur'an led conservative clerics to accuse him of <a3_0>shirk<a3_0/>, furthering their opposition to his regime. In July, a border war broke out with <a4_0>Egypt<a4_0/>, in which the Egyptians defeated Libya despite their technological inferiority. The conflict lasted one week before both sides agreed to sign a peace treaty that was brokered by several Arab states. That year, Gaddafi was invited to Moscow by the Soviet government in recognition of their increasing <a2_0>commercial<a2_0/> relationship."}
