In March 1978, the government issued guidelines for housing redistribution, attempting to ensure the population that every adult Libyan owned his own home and that nobody was enslaved to paying their rent. Most families were banned from owning more than one house, while former rental properties were seized and sold to the tenants at a heavily subsidized price. In September, Gaddafi called for the People's Committees to eliminate the \"bureaucracy of the <a0_0>public sector<a0_0/>\" and the \"dictatorship of the <a1_0>private sector<a1_0/>\"; the People's Committees took control of <a3_0>several hundred<a3_0/> companies, converting them into <a2_0>worker cooperatives<a2_0/> run by elected representatives."}
