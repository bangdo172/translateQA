Although advocated by Gaddafi and Tunisian President <a2_0>Habib Bourguiba<a2_0/>, the move was deeply unpopular in Tunisia and soon abandoned. Retaliating, Gaddafi sponsored anti-government militants in Tunisia into the 1980s. Turning his attention to <a3_0>Algeria<a3_0/>, in 1975 Libya signed the Hassi Messaoud defence agreement allegedly to counter \"<a4_0>Moroccan<a4_0/> expansionism\", also funding the Polisario Front of Western Sahara in their independence struggle against Morocco. Seeking to diversify Libya's economy, Gaddafi's government began purchasing shares in major European corporations like Fiat as well as buying real estate in Malta and Italy, which would become a valuable source of income during the 1980s oil slump."}
