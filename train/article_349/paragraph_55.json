Both sides disregarded the laws of war, committing human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions and revenge attacks. On 26 February the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1970, suspending Libya from the <a0_0>UN Human Rights Council<a0_0/>, implementing sanctions and calling for an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians. In <a1_0>March<a1_0/>, the Security Council declared a no fly zone to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment, calling on foreign nations to enforce it; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation. Ignoring this, Qatar sent <a2_0>hundreds<a2_0/> of troops to support the dissidents, and along with France and the <a3_0>United Arab Emirates<a3_0/> provided the NTC with weaponry and training."}
