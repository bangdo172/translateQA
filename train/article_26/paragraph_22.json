Lighting of structures considers aesthetic elements as well as practical considerations of quantity of light required, occupants of the structure, energy efficiency and cost. Artificial lighting takes into account the amount of daylight received in an internal space by using <a4_0>Daylight factor calculation.<a4_0/> For simple installations, hand-calculations based on <a3_0>tabular<a3_0/> data are used to provide an acceptable lighting design. More critical or optimized designs now routinely use mathematical modeling on a computer using software such as <a2_0>Radiance<a2_0/> which can allow an Architect to quickly undertake complex calculations to review the benefit of a particular design."}
