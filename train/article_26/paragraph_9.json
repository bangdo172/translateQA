The color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in Kelvin of a theoretical black body emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics of the lamp. An <a1_0>incandescent bulb<a1_0/> has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 Kelvin; daylight is around <a0_0>6400<a0_0/> Kelvin. <a3_0>Lower color temperature<a3_0/> lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum, while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a <a2_0>blue-white<a2_0/> appearance. For critical inspection or color matching tasks, or for retail displays of food and clothing, the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect."}
