{"qas": [{"question": "What type of study is used to simulate lighting designs?", "id": "56df89dc38dc421700152022", "answers": [{"text": "Photometric studies", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "<a0_0>Photometric studies<a0_0/> (also sometimes referred to as \"layouts\" or \"point by points\") are often used to simulate lighting designs for projects before they are built or renovated. This enables architects, lighting designers, and engineers to determine whether a proposed lighting setup will deliver the amount of light intended. They will also be able to determine the contrast ratio between light and dark areas. In many cases these studies are referenced against IESNA or CIBSE recommended lighting practices for the type of application. Depending on the type of area, different design aspects may be emphasized for safety or practicality (i.e. such as maintaining uniform light levels, avoiding glare or highlighting certain areas). Specialized software is often used to create these, which typically combine the use of two-dimensional digital CAD drawings and lighting calculation software (i.e. AGi32or Dialux)."}
