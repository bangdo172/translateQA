It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A <a1_0>master transformer<a1_0/> feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with <a3_0>12 or 24 volts<a3_0/>, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is <a2_0>cable lighting<a2_0/>, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension."}
