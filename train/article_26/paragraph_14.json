This uses diffuser panels hung like a suspended ceiling below fluorescent lights, and is considered general lighting. Other forms include neon, which is not usually intended to illuminate anything else, but to actually be an artwork in itself. This would probably fall under <a2_0>accent lighting<a2_0/>, though in a <a0_0>dark nightclub<a0_0/> it could be considered general lighting."}
