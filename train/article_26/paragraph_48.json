", "id": "56dfbac5231d4119001abd36", "answers": [{"text": "glare", "answer_start": 487}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "<a0_0>Light pollution<a0_0/> is a growing problem in reaction to excess light being given off by numerous signs, houses, and buildings. Polluting light is often wasted light involving unnecessary energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Light pollution is described as artificial light that is excessive or intrudes where it is not wanted. Well-designed lighting sends light only where it is needed without scattering it elsewhere. Poorly designed lighting can also compromise safety. For example, <a1_0>glare<a1_0/> creates safety issues around buildings by causing very sharp shadows, temporarily blinding passersby making them vulnerable to would-be assailants."}
