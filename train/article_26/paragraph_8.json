A fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the \"bulb\" to the surroundings. The more transparent the lighting fixture is, the higher efficacy. Shading the light will normally decrease efficacy but increase the directionality and the visual comfort probability."}
