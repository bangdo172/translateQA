It is used in photometry as a measure of the intensity, as perceived by the human eye, of light that hits or passes through a surface. It is analogous to the radiometric unit watts per square metre, but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the <a0_0>luminosity function<a0_0/>, a standardized model of human visual brightness perception. In English, \"lux\" is used in both singular and plural."}
