Headlamps are <a1_0>white or selective yellow<a1_0/> lights placed in the front of the vehicle, designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible. Many manufactures are turning to LED headlights as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional headlamps. Tail and brake lights are <a0_0>red<a0_0/> and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle's direction of travel to following drivers. <a3_0>White<a3_0/> rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle's transmission has been placed in the reverse gear, warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards, or about to do so. Flashing <a4_0>turn signals<a4_0/> on the front, side, and rear of the vehicle indicate an intended change of position or direction. In the <a2_0>late 1950s<a2_0/>, some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars' speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements."}
