Not only will greater reliance on natural light reduce energy consumption, but will favorably impact human health and performance. New studies have shown that the performance of students is influenced by the time and duration of daylight in their regular schedules. Designing school facilities to incorporate the right types of light at the right time of day for the right duration may improve student performance and well-being. Similarly, designing lighting systems that maximize the right amount of light at the appropriate time of day for the elderly may help relieve symptoms of <a0_0>Alzheimer's Disease<a0_0/>. The human circadian system is entrained to a <a1_0>24<a1_0/>-hour light-dark pattern that mimics the earth\u2019s natural light/dark pattern. When those patterns are disrupted, they <a2_0>disrupt the natural circadian cycle<a2_0/>. Circadian disruption may lead to numerous health problems including breast cancer, seasonal affective disorder, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and other ailments."}
