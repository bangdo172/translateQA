", "id": "56df912338dc421700152068", "answers": [{"text": "lumen (lm)", "answer_start": 1076}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source, along with the colors that can be rendered by this light. The human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum, therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light. The basic SI unit of measurement is the <a0_0>candela (cd)<a0_0/>, which describes the luminous intensity, all other photometric units are derived from the candela. Luminance for instance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle. The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre (<a1_0>cd/m2<a1_0/>). The CGS unit of luminance is the <a2_0>stilb<a2_0/>, which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd/m2. The amount of useful light emitted from a source or the luminous flux is measured in <a3_0>lumen (lm)<a3_0/>."}
