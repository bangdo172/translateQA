In the <a1_0><b6_0>2006<b6_0/><a1_0/> <a0_0><b5_0>Hill v. McDonough<b5_0/><a0_0/> case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the <a2_0><b7_0>Eighth<b7_0/><a2_0/> Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in <a3_0><b8_0>Baze v. Rees<b8_0/><a3_0/>, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983."}
