Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a \"wall\" or \"enclosure\" to \"exclude public view.\" For example, in <a0_0><b4_0>1919<b4_0/><a0_0/>, the Missouri legislature adopted a statute (L.1919, p. 781) which required, \"the sentence of death should be executed within the county jail, if convenient, and otherwise within an enclosure near the jail.\" The Missouri law permitted <a2_0>the <b6_0>local sheriff<b6_0/><a2_0/> to distribute passes to individuals (usually local citizens) whom he believed should witness the <a1_0><b5_0>hanging<b5_0/><a1_0/>, but the sheriffs \u2013 for various reasons \u2013 sometimes denied passes to individuals who wanted to watch. Missouri executions conducted after 1919 were not \"public\" because they were conducted behind closed walls, and the general public was not permitted to attend."}
