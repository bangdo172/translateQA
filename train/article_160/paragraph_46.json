A study by <b0_0>Pepperdine University<b0_0/> School of Law published in Temple Law Review, \"Unpredictable Doom and Lethal Injustice: An Argument for Greater Transparency in Death Penalty Decisions,\" surveyed the decision-making process among prosecutors in various states. The authors found that prosecutors' capital punishment filing decisions remain marked by local \"idiosyncrasies,\" suggesting they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court's directive. This means that \"the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to eliminate\" may still \"infect capital cases.\" Wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law, for example, has <b1_0>22<b1_0/> \"special circumstances,\" making nearly all premeditated murders potential capital cases. The 32 death penalty states have varying numbers and types of \"death qualifiers\" \u2013 circumstances that allow for capital charges. The number varies from a high of 34 in California to 22 in Colorado and Delaware to 12 in Texas, Nebraska, Georgia and Montana. The study's authors call for reform of state procedures along the lines of reforms in the federal system, which the <b2_0>U.S. Department of Justice initiated with a 1995 protocol<b2_0/>. Crimes subject to the death penalty vary by jurisdiction. All jurisdictions that use capital punishment designate the highest grade of murder a capital crime, although most jurisdictions require aggravating circumstances. Treason against the United States, as well as treason against the states of Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri are capital offenses."}
