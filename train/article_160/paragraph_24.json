However, when given a choice between the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole, support has traditionally been significantly lower than polling which has only mentioned the death penalty as a punishment. In 2010, for instance, one poll showed 49 percent favoring the death penalty and 46 percent favoring life imprisonment while in another 61% said they preferred another punishment to the death penalty. The highest level of support for the death penalty recorded overall was 80 percent in <a0_0><b4_0>1994<b4_0/><a0_0/> (16 percent opposed), and the lowest recorded was 42 percent in 1966 (<a1_0><b5_0>47<b5_0/><a1_0/> percent opposed). On the question of the death penalty vs. life without parole, the strongest preference for the death penalty was 61 percent in 1997 (<a2_0><b6_0>29<b6_0/><a2_0/> percent favoring life), and the lowest preference for the death penalty was <a3_0><b7_0>47<b7_0/><a3_0/> percent in 2006 (48 percent favoring life)."}
