Yet, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is <a0_0><b4_0>state collateral review<b4_0/><a0_0/>. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state. Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review. Most often these are claims, such as <a3_0><b7_0>ineffective assistance of counsel<b7_0/><a3_0/>, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around <a1_0><b5_0>6<b5_0/><a1_0/> percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review. In 2010, the death sentences of <a2_0><b6_0>53<b6_0/><a2_0/> inmates were overturned as a result of legal appeals or high court reversals."}
