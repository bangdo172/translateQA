The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of <a2_0><b5_0>Byron White<b5_0/><a2_0/> and Potter Stewart, expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and <a1_0><b4_0>William O. Douglas<b4_0/><a1_0/> worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty. Thurgood Marshall and <a0_0><b3_0>William J. Brennan, Jr<b3_0/>.<a0_0/> expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as \"cruel and unusual\" punishment."}
