At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any <a3_0><b8_0>mitigating<b8_0/><a3_0/> factors exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty \u2013 either death or life in prison, either with or without parole."}
