For example, Hospira, the sole American manufacturer of <a1_0><b6_0>sodium thiopental<b6_0/><a1_0/>, the critical anesthetic in the three-drug cocktail, announced in <a2_0><b7_0>2011<b7_0/><a2_0/> that it would no longer manufacture the drug for the American market, in part for ethical reasons and in part because its transfer of sodium thiopental manufacturing to <a3_0><b8_0>Italy<b8_0/><a3_0/> would subject it to the European Union's <a4_0>Torture Regulation<a4_0/>, which forbids the use of any product manufactured within the Union for torture (as execution by lethal injection is considered by the Regulation). Since the drug manufacturers began taking these steps and the EU regulation ended the importation of drugs produced in Europe, the resulting shortage of execution drugs has led to or influenced decisions to impose moratoria in Arkansas, California, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, and Tennessee."}
