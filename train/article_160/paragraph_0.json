The <b5_0>direct review<b5_0/> process is a typical legal appeal. An <a1_0><b6_0>appellate<b6_0/><a1_0/> court examines the record of evidence presented in the <a4_0>trial<a4_0/> court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not. Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of <a2_0><b7_0>three<b7_0/><a2_0/> outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible. About <a3_0><b8_0>60<b8_0/><a3_0/> percent survive the process of direct review intact."}
