However, that number is lower than that of prison inmates, which is <a2_0><b7_0>47<b7_0/><a2_0/> percent. According to the US Department of Justice, African Americans accounted for 52.5% of homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008, with whites 45.3% and Native Americans and Asians <a3_0><b8_0>2.2%<b8_0/><a3_0/>. This means African Americans are less likely to be executed on a per capita basis. However, according to a 2003 Amnesty International report, blacks and whites were the victims of murder in almost equal numbers, yet 80 percent of the people executed since 1977 were convicted of murders involving white victims. 13.5% of death row inmates are of Hispanic or Latino descent, while they make up <a4_0><b9_0>17.4%<b9_0/><a4_0/> of the general population."}
