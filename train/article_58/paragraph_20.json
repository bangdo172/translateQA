The letters <b6_0>c, q, w, x and y<b6_0/> are limited to proper names of foreign origin, and f, z, \u0161, and \u017e appear in loanwords and foreign names only. \u00d6 and \u00fc are pronounced similarly to their equivalents in Swedish and German. Unlike in standard German but like Finnish and Swedish (when followed by 'r'), \u00c4 is pronounced <a2_0>[\u00e6], as in English mat<a2_0/>. The vowels <b5_0>\u00c4, \u00d6 and \u00dc<b5_0/> are clearly separate phonemes and inherent in Estonian, although the letter shapes come from German. The letter \u00f5 denotes /\u0264/, unrounded /o/, or a close-mid back unrounded vowel. It is almost identical to the Bulgarian \u044a /\u0264\u031e/ and the Vietnamese \u01a1, and is used to transcribe the Russian \u044b."}
