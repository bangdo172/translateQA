Thus the illative for <b4_0>kollane maja<b4_0/> (\"a yellow house\") is kollasesse majja (\"into a yellow house\"), but the terminative is kollase majani (\"as far as a yellow house\"). With respect to the Proto-Finnic language, elision has occurred; thus, the actual case marker may be absent, but the stem is changed, cf. maja \u2013 majja and the Pohjanmaa dialect of Finnish maja \u2013 majahan."}
