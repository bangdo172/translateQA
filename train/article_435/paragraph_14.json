The language is not given any official recognition in the Constitution of Pakistan at the national level. Punjabis themselves are a heterogeneous group comprising different tribes, clans (Urdu: \u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0631\u06cc\u200e) and communities. In Pakistani Punjab these <b9_0>tribes<b9_0/> have more to do with traditional occupations such as blacksmiths or artisans as opposed to rigid social stratifications. Punjabi dialects spoken in the province include <b8_0>Majhi<b8_0/> (Standard), Saraiki and Hindko. Saraiki is mostly spoken in <a4_0>south Punjab<a4_0/>, and Pashto, spoken in some parts of north west Punjab, especially in Attock District and Mianwali District."}
