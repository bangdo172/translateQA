The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted. June and July are oppressively hot. Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above <b6_0><b9_0>46 \u00b0C<b9_0/><b6_0/>, newspaper sources claim that it reaches <a2_0>51 \u00b0C<a2_0/> and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat.

In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season, referred to as barsat, which brings relief in its wake. The hardest part of the summer is then over, but cooler weather does not come until late October."}
