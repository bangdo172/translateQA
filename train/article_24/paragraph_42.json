This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When <a2_0><b6_0>Pope John XXIII<b6_0/><a2_0/> abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do.
