In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were <a0_0><b7_0>the deacons of the seven regions of the city<b7_0/><a0_0/> at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word <b8_0>began to mean \u201cprincipal,\u201d \u201ceminent,\u201d or \"superior.\"<b8_0/> The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \"title\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the <a1_0><b9_0>8th century<b9_0/><a1_0/> the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of <a2_0><b10_0>769<b10_0/><a2_0/>, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of <a3_0>Nicholas II<a3_0/>, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under <a4_0>the Papal Bull In nomine Domini<a4_0/>. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the <b11_0>Third Lateran Council<b11_0/> in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by <a6_0>Pope Innocent IV<a6_0/> in <a5_0>1244<a5_0/>."}
