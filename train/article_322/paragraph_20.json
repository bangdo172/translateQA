This rebirth can be traced to the movement of <a1_0><b5_0>New Urbanism<a1_0/> and postmodern architecture<b5_0/>'s embrace of classical elements as <a2_0>ironic<a2_0/>, especially in light of the dominance of Modernism. While some continued to work with <b6_0>classicism<b6_0/> as ironic, some architects such as <a3_0>Thomas Gordon Smith<a3_0/>, began to consider classicism seriously. While some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the <b7_0>University of Virginia<b7_0/>, no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and Duncan Stroik at the University of Notre Dame that continues successfully. Programs at the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence. Today one can find numerous buildings embracing neoclassical style, since <b8_0>a generation of architects trained in this discipline<b8_0/> shapes urban planning."}
