Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of <a1_0>Napoleon I<a1_0/> in the First French Empire, where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, <a3_0>Federal style<a3_0/> in the United States, the <a2_0>Regency<a2_0/> style in Britain, and the Napoleonstil in Sweden. According to the art historian Hugh Honour \"so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the <b7_0>Empire<b7_0/> marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces\"."}
