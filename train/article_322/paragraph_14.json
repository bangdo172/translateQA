In the British Raj in India, Sir Edwin Lutyens' monumental city planning for <a2_0><b6_0>New Delhi<b6_0/><a2_0/> marked the sunset of neoclassicism. In <b7_0>Scotland<b7_0/> and the north of England, where the <a3_0>Gothic Revival<a3_0/> was less strong, architects continued to develop the <b8_0>neoclassical style of William Henry Playfair.<b8_0/> The works of Cuthbert Brodrick and Alexander Thomson show that by the end of the 19th century the results could be powerful and eccentric."}
