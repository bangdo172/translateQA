First, formal amendment requires State parties to the treaty to go through <a1_0>the ratification process<a1_0/> all over again. The re-negotiation of treaty provisions can be long and protracted, and often <a4_0>some parties to the original treaty will not become parties to the amended treaty<a4_0/>. When determining the legal obligations of states, one party to the original treaty and one a party to the amended treaty, the states will only be bound by <a3_0>the terms they both agreed upon<a3_0/>. Treaties can also be amended informally by the treaty executive council when the changes are only procedural, technical change in customary international law can also amend a treaty, where state behavior evinces a new interpretation of the legal obligations under the treaty. Minor corrections to a treaty may be adopted by a proc\u00e8s-verbal; but <a2_0>a proc\u00e8s-verbal<a2_0/> is generally reserved for changes to rectify obvious errors in the text adopted, i.e. where the text adopted does not correctly reflect the intention of the parties adopting it."}
