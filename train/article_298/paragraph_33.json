Following the partition of Ireland in 1921 which saw the creation of the sovereign Irish Free State (<b9_0>which <a4_0>eventually evolved into the modern day Republic of Ireland<b9_0/><a4_0/>), Northern Ireland retained its devolved government through the Parliament of Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK to have such a body at this time. This body was suspended in 1972 and Northern Ireland was governed by direct rule during the period of conflict known as The Troubles."}
