In the 1890s the governments of these colonies all held referendums on becoming a unified, self-governing \"Commonwealth\" within the British Empire. When all the colonies voted in favour of federation, the Federation of Australia commenced, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901.
