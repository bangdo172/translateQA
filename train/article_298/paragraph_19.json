The federal government has certain express powers (also called <a1_0><b6_0>enumerated powers<b6_0/><a1_0/>) which are powers spelled out <a2_0>in <b7_0>the Constitution<b7_0/><a2_0/>, including <a3_0><b8_0>the right to levy taxes, declare war, and regulate interstate and foreign commerce.<b8_0/><a3_0/> In addition, the Necessary and Proper Clause <a4_0><b9_0>gives the federal government the implied power to pass any law \"necessary and proper\" for the execution of its express powers<a4_0/>.<b9_0/> Other powers\u2014the reserved powers\u2014are reserved to the people or the states. The power delegated to the federal government was significantly expanded by the Supreme Court decision in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), amendments to the Constitution following the Civil War, and by some later amendments\u2014as well as the overall claim of the Civil War, that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government."}
