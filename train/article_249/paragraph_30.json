From 1997 to 2001, <b6_0>ITV and Sky<b6_0/> shared live coverage with both having two matches per round and BBC continuing with highlights on Match of the Day. From 2002 to 2008, BBC and Sky again shared coverage with BBC having two or three matches per round and Sky having one or two. From 2008\u201309 to 2013\u201314<a1_0>, FA Cup matches are shown live by ITV across England and Wales, with UTV broadcasting to Northern Ireland<a1_0/> but <a2_0><b7_0>STV<b7_0/> refusing to show them<a2_0/>. ITV shows 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one semi-final exclusively live. The final is also shown live on ITV. Under the same 2008 contract, <b8_0>Setanta Sports<b8_0/> showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final. The channel also broadcast ITV's matches exclusively to Scotland, after the ITV franchise holder in Scotland, STV, decided not to broadcast FA Cup games. Setanta entered administration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal to broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and England internationals. As a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed the competition exclusively in the 2009\u201310 season with between three and four matches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA could not find a pay TV broadcaster in time. ESPN bought the competition <a4_0>for the 2010\u201311 to 2012\u201313 season<a4_0/> and during this time <a3_0><b9_0>Rebecca Lowe<b9_0/> became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK."}
