It was stolen in <b5_0>1895<b5_0/> and never recovered, and so was replaced by an exact replica, used until 1910<a4_0>. The FA decided to change the design after the 1909 winners, Manchester United, made their own replica,<a4_0/> leading the FA to realise they did not own the copyright. This new, larger design was by <b7_0>Messers Fattorini and Sons<b7_0/>, and was used from 1911. In order to preserve this original, from 1992 it was replaced by an exact replica, although this had to be replaced after just over two decades, after showing wear and tear from being handled more than in previous eras. This third replica, first used in <b9_0>2014<b9_0/>, was built heavier to withstand the increased handling. Of the four surviving trophies, only the 1895 replica has entered private ownership."}
