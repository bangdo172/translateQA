The Oklahoma City bombing of <a0_0>April 19, 1995<a0_0/>, in which <a1_0>Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols<a1_0/> detonated an explosive outside of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed <a2_0>168<a2_0/> people, including <a3_0>19<a3_0/> children. The two men were convicted of the bombing: McVeigh was sentenced to death and executed by the federal government on <a4_0>June 11, 2001<a4_0/>; his partner Nichols is serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. McVeigh's army buddy, Michael Fortier, was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison and ordered to pay a $75,000 fine for his role in the bombing plot (i.e. assisting in the sale of guns to raise funds for the bombing, and examining the Murrah Federal building as a possible target before the terrorist attack). His wife, Lori Fortier, who has since died, was granted immunity from prosecution in return for her testimony in the case."}
