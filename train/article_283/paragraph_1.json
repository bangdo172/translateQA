Equivalent to the English word Indian, okla humma was a phrase in the Choctaw language used to describe Native American people as a whole. Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory, and it was officially approved in <a4_0>1890<a4_0/>, two years after the area was opened to white settlers."}
