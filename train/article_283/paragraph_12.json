Precipitation and temperatures decline from east to west accordingly, with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature of <a4_0>62 \u00b0F<a4_0/> (17 \u00b0C) and an annual rainfall of generally over 40 inches (1,020 mm) and up to 56 inches (1,420 mm), while areas of the (higher-elevation) panhandle average 58 \u00b0F (14 \u00b0C), with an annual rainfall under 17 inches (430 mm)."}
