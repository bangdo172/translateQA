As an example, on November 11, 1911, the temperature at Oklahoma City reached <a0_0>83 \u00b0F<a0_0/> (28 \u00b0C) in the afternoon (the record high for that date), then <a2_0>an Arctic cold front<a2_0/> of unprecedented intensity slammed across the state, causing the temperature to crash 66 degrees, down to <a1_0>17 \u00b0F<a1_0/> (\u22128 \u00b0C) at midnight (the record low for that date); thus, both the record high and record low for November 11 were set on the same date. This type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area, such as the 1912 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front, resulting in an average of about <a3_0>one tornado per hour<a3_0/> over the course of <a4_0>a day<a4_0/>."}
