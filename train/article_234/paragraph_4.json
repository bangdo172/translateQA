A membership organization <a1_0>elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws<a1_0/>. A board-only organization typically has a <a2_0>self-selected board, and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board<a2_0/>. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as \"members\"; examples of such organizations are <b5_0>Fairvote and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws<b5_0/>. The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act imposes <b6_0>many complexities and requirements<b6_0/> on membership decision-making. Accordingly, many organizations, such as Wikimedia, have formed <b7_0>board-only<b7_0/> structures. The National Association of Parliamentarians has generated concerns about <b8_0>the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns<b8_0/> in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to <b9_0>market discipline for products and shareholder discipline of their capital<b9_0/>; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse. A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements. A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from <a3_0>financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to its members/directors is concerned<a3_0/>. Beware of board-only organizations- review the board members annual income before donating, such as the Clinton Foundation. <a4_0>Board members who decide what percentage of your donations will increase their personal wealth are rampant in abusing this designation<a4_0/> of an NPO, and this is why they attempt to avoid audits and use a double bottom line for taxing."}
