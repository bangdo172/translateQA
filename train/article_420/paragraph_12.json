Armenians of the Diaspora are the primary speakers of the <a2_0>Western<a2_0/> dialect of the Armenian language. This dialect has <a3_0>considerable differences with Eastern Armenian, but speakers of either of the two variations can <b5_0>usually understand each other<b5_0/><a3_0/>. <a4_0>Eastern<a4_0/> Armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in Iran and European countries such as Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia (where they form a majority in <b6_0>the Samtskhe-Javakheti province<b6_0/>).
