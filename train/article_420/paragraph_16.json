This period of time is often viewed as the Golden Age of Armenian literature. Early Armenian literature was written by <b7_0>the \"father of Armenian history\"<b7_0/>, <a2_0><a3_0>Moses of Chorene<a3_0/><a2_0/>, who authored <b8_0>The History of Armenia<b8_0/>. The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD. The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to give rise to modern Armenian literature. This period of time, during which Armenian culture flourished, is known as the Revival period (Zartonki sherchan). The Revivalist authors of Constantinople and Tiflis, almost identical to the <a4_0>Romanticists<a4_0/> of Europe, were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism. Most of them adopted the newly created Eastern or Western variants of the Armenian language depending on the targeted audience, and preferred them over classical Armenian (grabar). This period ended after the Hamidian massacres, when Armenians experienced turbulent times. As <b9_0>Armenian history of the 1920s and of the Genocide<b9_0/> came to be more openly discussed, writers like Paruyr Sevak, Gevork Emin, Silva Kaputikyan and Hovhannes Shiraz began a new era of literature."}
