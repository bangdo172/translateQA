It has a complex relationship with the <a2_0>discipline of economics<a2_0/>, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of Anthropology, <a3_0>Bronislaw Malinowski<a3_0/>, and his French compatriot, Marcel Mauss, on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or reciprocity) as an alternative to <b7_0>market exchange<b7_0/>. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon <a4_0>exchange<a4_0/>. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as <b8_0>Political Economy<b8_0/> focuses on production, in contrast. Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective."}
