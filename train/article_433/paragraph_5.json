Following <b7_0>Broca<b7_0/>'s lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of <a2_0>comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology<a2_0/> to differentiate man from \"the animals nearest to him\". He stresses that the data of comparison must be <a3_0>empirical<a3_0/>, gathered by experimentation. The history of <a4_0>civilization<a4_0/> as well as <b8_0>ethnology<b8_0/> are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that \"the same laws of thought are applicable to all men\"."}
