Political Economy introduced questions of <a1_0>history and colonialism<a1_0/> to ahistorical anthropological <b6_0>theories of social structure and culture<b6_0/>. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the \"pre-capitalist\" societies that were subject to evolutionary \"tribal\" stereotypes. Sahlins work on <a2_0>Hunter-gatherers<a2_0/> as the 'original affluent society' did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's <a3_0>population<a3_0/> at the time, <b7_0>the peasantry<b7_0/>, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.
