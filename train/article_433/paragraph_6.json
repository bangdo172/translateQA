It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the <a3_0>French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9<a3_0/> were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, <b8_0>The Anthropological Review<b8_0/>, Hunt stressed the work of <a4_0>Waitz<a4_0/>, adopting his definitions as a standard.[n 5] Among the first associates were the young Edward Burnett Tylor, inventor of <b9_0>cultural anthropology<b9_0/>, and his brother Alfred Tylor, a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist."}
