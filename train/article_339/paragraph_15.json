These influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks, and bayogu), songs and fashion. During Spanish colonial rule (<a0_0><b6_0><b7_0>1668<b7_0/><b6_0/>\u2013<b8_0>1898<b8_0/><a0_0/>) the majority of the population was converted to <a1_0>Roman Catholicism<a1_0/> and religious festivities such as <a2_0>Easter and Christmas<a2_0/> became widespread. Post-contact Chamorro cuisine is largely based on <b4_0>corn<b4_0/>, and includes tortillas, tamales, atole and chilaquiles, which are a clear influence from Spanish trade between Mesoamerica and Asia. The modern Chamorro language is a <a3_0><b5_0>Malayo-Polynesian<b5_0/><a3_0/> language with much Spanish and Filipino influence. Many Chamorros also have Spanish surnames because of their conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity and the adoption of names from the Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos, a phenomenon also common to the Philippines."}
