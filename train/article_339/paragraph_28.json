It <a2_0>nearly eliminated the native bird population<a2_0/>. The problem was exacerbated because the reptile has no natural predators on the island. The brown tree snake, known locally as the kulebla, is native to northern and eastern coasts of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and <b8_0>the Solomon Islands<b8_0/>. While slightly venomous, the snake is relatively harmless to human beings. Although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on Guam, residents rarely see the nocturnal creatures. The United States Department of Agriculture <a3_0>has <b6_0>trained detector dogs<b6_0/> to keep the snakes out of the island's cargo flow<a3_0/>. The United States Geological Survey also has dogs capable of detecting snakes in forested environments around the region's islands."}
