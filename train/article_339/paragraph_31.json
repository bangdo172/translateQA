Most fires are <a1_0>man<a1_0/>-caused with 80% resulting from <b3_0>arson<b3_0/>. Poachers often start fires to attract <b6_0>deer<b6_0/> to the new growth. Invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas. Grasslands and \"barrens\" have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion. During the rainy season <a2_0>sediment is carried by the <b5_0>heavy rains<b5_0/> into the Fena Lake Reservoir and Ugum River<a2_0/>, leading to water quality problems for southern Guam. Eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island. Soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers (<b4_0>planting trees<b4_0/>) have had little success in preserving natural habitats."}
