A council was established in London, with a subsidiary body in Washington. However, the smaller powers continued to push for an American-based body. The Pacific War Council was formed in Washington, on <a0_0>1 April 1942<a0_0/>, with <a1_0>President Franklin D. Roosevelt<a1_0/>, his key advisor <a2_0>Harry Hopkins<a2_0/>, and representatives from Britain, China, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Canada. Representatives from India and the Philippines were later added. The council never had any direct operational control, and any decisions it made were referred to the U.S.-UK Combined Chiefs of Staff, which was also in <a3_0>Washington<a3_0/>. Allied resistance, at first symbolic, gradually began to stiffen. Australian and Dutch forces led civilians in a prolonged guerilla campaign in <a4_0>Portuguese Timor<a4_0/>."}
