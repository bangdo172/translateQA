Mitscher launched 230 torpedo planes and dive bombers. He then discovered the enemy was actually another 60 miles (97 km)[citation needed] further off, out of aircraft range (based on a roundtrip flight). Mitscher decided this chance to destroy the Japanese fleet was worth the risk of aircraft losses due to running out of fuel on the return flight. Overall, the U.S. lost <a2_0>130<a2_0/> planes and <a4_0>76<a4_0/> aircrew; however, Japan lost <a3_0>450<a3_0/> planes, three carriers, and 445 aircrew. The Imperial Japanese Navy's carrier force was effectively destroyed."}
