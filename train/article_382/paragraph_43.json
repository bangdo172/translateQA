Over the previous month American destroyers had destroyed <a0_0>17<a0_0/> of 25 submarines out of Ozawa's screening force. Repeated U.S. raids destroyed the Japanese land-based planes. Ozawa's main attack lacked coordination, with the Japanese planes arriving at their targets in a <a2_0>staggered<a2_0/> sequence. Following a directive from <a4_0>Nimitz<a4_0/>, the U.S. carriers all had <a3_0>combat information centers<a3_0/>, which interpreted the flow of radar data and radioed interception orders to the Hellcats. The result was later dubbed the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot. The few attackers to reach the U.S. fleet encountered massive AA fire with proximity fuzes. Only <a1_0>one<a1_0/> American warship was slightly damaged."}
