Within minutes, all three were ablaze and had to be abandoned with great loss of life. <a1_0>Hiry\u016b<a1_0/> managed to survive the wave of dive bombers and launched a counter-attack against the American carriers which caused severe damage to Yorktown (which was later finished off by a Japanese submarine). However, a second attack from the U.S. carriers a few hours later found and destroyed Hiry\u016b, the last remaining fleet carrier available to Nagumo. With his carriers lost and the Americans withdrawn out of range of his powerful battleships, Yamamoto was forced to call off the operation, leaving Midway in American hands. The battle proved to be a decisive victory for the <a2_0>Allies<a2_0/>. For the second time, Japanese expansion had been checked and its formidable Combined Fleet was significantly weakened by the loss of <a3_0>four<a3_0/> fleet carriers and many highly trained, virtually irreplaceable, personnel. Japan would be largely on the defensive for the rest of the war."}
