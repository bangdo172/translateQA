For the rest of February, the Americans pushed north, and by 1 March, had taken two-thirds of the island. But it was not until <a3_0>26 March<a3_0/> that the island was finally secured. The Japanese fought to the last man, killing 6,800 Marines and wounding nearly 20,000 more. The Japanese losses totaled well over 20,000 men killed, and only <a4_0>1,083<a4_0/> prisoners were taken. Historians debate whether it was strategically worth the casualties sustained."}
