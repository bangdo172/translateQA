Most of the Japanese aircraft based in the South Pacific were redeployed to the defense of <a0_0>Guadalcanal<a0_0/>. Many were lost in numerous engagements with the Allied air forces based at Henderson Field as well as carrier based aircraft. Meanwhile, Japanese ground forces launched repeated attacks on heavily defended US positions around <a1_0>Henderson Field<a1_0/>, in which they suffered appalling casualties. To sustain these offensives, resupply was carried out by Japanese convoys, termed the <a2_0>\"Tokyo Express\"<a2_0/> by the Allies. The convoys often faced night battles with enemy naval forces in which they expended destroyers that the IJN could ill-afford to lose. Later fleet battles involving heavier ships and even daytime carrier battles resulted in a stretch of water near Guadalcanal becoming known as \"Ironbottom Sound\" from <a3_0>the multitude of ships sunk<a3_0/> on both sides. However, the Allies were much better able to replace these losses. Finally recognizing that the campaign to recapture Henderson Field and secure Guadalcanal had simply become too costly to continue, the Japanese evacuated the island and withdrew in <a4_0>February 1943<a4_0/>. In the sixth month war of attrition, the Japanese had lost as a result of failing to commit enough forces in sufficient time."}
