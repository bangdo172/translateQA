The United States used the ensuing period to turn its vast industrial potential into <a0_0>increased numbers of ships, planes, and trained aircrew<a0_0/>. At the same time, Japan, lacking an adequate industrial base or technological strategy, a good aircrew training program, or adequate naval resources and commerce defense, fell further and further behind. In strategic terms the Allies began a long movement across the Pacific, seizing one island base after another. Not every Japanese stronghold had to be captured; some, like Truk, Rabaul, and Formosa, were neutralized by <a1_0>air attack<a1_0/> and bypassed. The goal was to get close to Japan itself, then launch massive strategic air attacks, improve the <a2_0>submarine blockade<a2_0/>, and finally (only if necessary) execute an invasion."}
