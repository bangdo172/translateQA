However, the problem of <a1_0>Allied forces surrounded in the Philippines<a1_0/>, during the early part of 1942, led to diversion of boats to \"guerrilla submarine\" missions. As well, basing in Australia placed boats under Japanese aerial threat while en route to patrol areas, reducing their effectiveness, and Nimitz relied on submarines for <a2_0>close surveillance of enemy bases<a2_0/>. Furthermore, the standard-issue Mark 14 torpedo and its Mark VI exploder both proved defective, problems which were not corrected until <a3_0>September 1943<a3_0/>. Worst of all, before the war, an uninformed US Customs officer had seized a copy of the <a4_0>Japanese merchant marine code<a4_0/> (called the \"maru code\" in the USN), not knowing that the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) had broken it. The Japanese promptly changed it, and the new code was not broken again by OP-20G until 1943."}
