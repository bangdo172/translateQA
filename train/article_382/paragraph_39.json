This attack, codenamed Operation U-Go, was advocated by <a1_0>Lieutenant General Renya Mutaguchi<a1_0/>, the recently promoted commander of the Japanese Fifteenth Army; Imperial General Headquarters permitted it to proceed, despite misgivings at several intervening headquarters. Although several units of the British Fourteenth Army had to fight their way out of encirclement, by early April they had concentrated around Imphal in Manipur state. A Japanese division which had advanced to <a2_0>Kohima in Nagaland<a2_0/> cut the <a3_0>main road to Imphal<a3_0/>, but failed to capture the whole of the <a4_0>defences at Kohima<a4_0/>. During April, the Japanese attacks against Imphal failed, while fresh Allied formations drove the Japanese from the positions they had captured at Kohima."}
