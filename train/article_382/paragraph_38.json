In the first months of 1944, the Chinese and American troops of the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC), commanded by the American <a1_0>Joseph Stilwell<a1_0/>, began extending the <a2_0>Ledo Road<a2_0/> from India into northern Burma, while the <a3_0>XV Corps<a3_0/> began an advance along the coast in the Arakan Province. In February 1944 the Japanese mounted a local counter-attack in the Arakan. After early Japanese success, this counter-attack was defeated when the Indian divisions of <a4_0>XV Corps<a4_0/> stood firm, relying on aircraft to drop supplies to isolated forward units until reserve divisions could relieve them."}
