Historian Dewey W. Grantham traces divisions in the state to the period of the American Civil War: for decades afterward, the <a1_0>eastern<a1_0/> third of the state was Republican and the western two thirds voted Democrat. This division was related to the state's pattern of farming, plantations and slaveholding. The eastern section was made up of <a2_0>yeoman<a2_0/> farmers, but Middle and West Tennessee cultivated crops, such as <a3_0>tobacco and cotton<a3_0/>, that were dependent on the use of slave labor. These areas became defined as Democratic after the war."}
