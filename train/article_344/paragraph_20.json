Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed, and the counties (now numbering eight) had re-joined North Carolina by 1789. North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized into the <a1_0>Southwest Territory<a1_0/>. In an effort to encourage settlers to move west into the new territory, in 1787 the mother state of North Carolina ordered a road to be cut to take settlers into the Cumberland Settlements\u2014from the south end of Clinch Mountain (in East Tennessee) to <a2_0>French Lick<a2_0/> (Nashville). The Trace was called the \"North Carolina Road\" or \"Avery's Trace\", and sometimes \"The <a3_0>Wilderness Road<a3_0/>\" (although it should not be confused with Daniel Boone's \"Wilderness Road\" through the Cumberland Gap)."}
