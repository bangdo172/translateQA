Pardo recorded the name \"Tanasqui\" from a local Indian village, which evolved to the state's current name. At that time, Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of <a2_0>Muscogee and Yuchi<a2_0/> people. Possibly because of European diseases devastating the Indian tribes, which would have left a population vacuum, and also from expanding European settlement in the north, the <a3_0>Cherokee<a3_0/> moved south from the area now called Virginia. As European colonists spread into the area, the Indian populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west, including all Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the Chickasaw and Choctaw, and ultimately, the Cherokee in <a4_0>1838<a4_0/>."}
