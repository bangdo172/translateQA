Tennessee's <a2_0>1st and 2nd<a2_0/> congressional districts, based in the <a4_0>Tri-Cities and Knoxville<a4_0/>, respectively, are among the few historically Republican districts in the South. Those districts' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War; they identified with the GOP after the war and have stayed with that party ever since.
