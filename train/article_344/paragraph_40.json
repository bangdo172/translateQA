Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics. But in the <a1_0>1880s<a1_0/>, the white-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration. These served to disenfranchise most African Americans, and their power in the <a2_0>Republican<a2_0/> Party, the state, and cities where they had significant population was markedly reduced. In 1900 African Americans comprised <a3_0>23.8<a3_0/> percent of the state's population, concentrated in Middle and West Tennessee. In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of commission government for cities based on at-large voting for a few positions on a <a4_0>Board of Commission<a4_0/>; several adopted this as another means to limit African-American political participation. In 1913 the state legislature enacted a bill enabling cities to adopt this structure without legislative approval."}
