The state averages around <a1_0>50<a1_0/> days of thunderstorms per year, some of which can be severe with large hail and damaging winds. Tornadoes are possible throughout the state, with <a2_0>West and Middle Tennessee<a2_0/> the most vulnerable. Occasionally, strong or violent tornadoes occur, such as the devastating April 2011 tornadoes that killed 20 people in North Georgia and Southeast Tennessee. On average, the state has <a3_0>15<a3_0/> tornadoes per year. Tornadoes in Tennessee can be severe, and Tennessee leads the nation in the percentage of total tornadoes which have fatalities. Winter storms are an occasional problem, such as the infamous Blizzard of <a4_0>1993<a4_0/>, although ice storms are a more likely occurrence. Fog is a persistent problem in parts of the state, especially in East Tennessee."}
