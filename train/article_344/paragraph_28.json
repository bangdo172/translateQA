Through violence and intimidation against freedmen and their allies, White Democrats regained political power in Tennessee and other states across the South in the late 1870s and 1880s. Over the next decade, the state legislature passed increasingly restrictive laws to control <a0_0>African Americans<a0_0/>. In <a1_0>1889<a1_0/> the General Assembly passed four laws described as electoral reform, with the cumulative effect of essentially disfranchising most African Americans in rural areas and small towns, as well as many <a2_0>poor Whites<a2_0/>. Legislation included implementation of a poll tax, timing of registration, and recording requirements. Tens of thousands of taxpaying citizens were without representation for decades into the 20th century. Disfranchising legislation accompanied <a3_0>Jim Crow laws<a3_0/> passed in the late 19th century, which imposed segregation in the state. In 1900, African Americans made up nearly 24% of the state's population, and numbered <a4_0>480,430<a4_0/> citizens who lived mostly in the central and western parts of the state."}
