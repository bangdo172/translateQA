Its provisions are reflected in <b5_0>Article 29<b5_0/>. There was a binding provision for a new delimitation of the federal territory: <a0_0>the Federal Territory must be revised<a0_0/> ... (paragraph 1). Moreover, in territories or parts of territories whose affiliation with a Land had changed after 8 May 1945 without <b6_0>a referendum<b6_0/>, people were allowed to petition for a revision of the current status within a year after the promulgation of the Basic Law (paragraph 2). If at least <a1_0><b7_0>one tenth<b7_0/><a1_0/> of those entitled to vote in Bundestag elections were in favour of a revision, the federal government had to include the proposal into its legislation. Then <a2_0>a referendum<a2_0/> was required in each territory or part of a territory whose affiliation was to be changed (paragraph 3). The proposal should not take effect if within any of the affected territories a majority rejected the change. In this case, the bill had to be introduced again and after passing had to be confirmed by referendum in <b8_0>the Federal Republic<b8_0/> as a whole (paragraph 4). The reorganization should be completed within three years after the Basic Law had come into force (<a3_0>paragraph 6<a3_0/>)."}
