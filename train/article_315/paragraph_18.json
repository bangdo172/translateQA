In the three free states of Bavaria, Saxony, and Thuringia the government is referred to as <a1_0>the State Government<a1_0/> (Staatsregierung), and in the other ten states the term Land Government (Landesregierung) is used. Before January 1, 2000, <b6_0>Bavaria<b6_0/> had <a2_0>a <b5_0>bicameral parliament<b5_0/><a2_0/>, with a popularly elected Landtag, and a Senate made up of <b7_0>representatives of the state's major social and economic groups<b7_0/>. The Senate was abolished following a referendum in 1998. The states of Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg are governed slightly differently from the other states. In each of those cities, the executive branch consists of a Senate of <b8_0>approximately <a3_0>eight<b8_0/><a3_0/>, selected by the state's parliament; the senators carry out duties equivalent to those of the ministers in the larger states. The equivalent of the Minister-President is the Senatspr\u00e4sident (President of the Senate) in Bremen, the Erster B\u00fcrgermeister (First Mayor) in Hamburg, and the <b9_0>Regierender B\u00fcrgermeister<b9_0/> (Governing Mayor) in Berlin. The parliament for Berlin is called the <a4_0>Abgeordnetenhaus<a4_0/> (House of Representatives), while Bremen and Hamburg both have a B\u00fcrgerschaft. The parliaments in the remaining 13 states are referred to as Landtag (State Parliament)."}
