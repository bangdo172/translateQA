Though international relations including international treaties are primarily the responsibility of the federal level, the constituent states have certain limited powers in this area: in matters that affect them directly, the states defend their interests at the federal level through <a3_0><b8_0>the <b12_0>Bundesrat<b12_0/><b8_0/><a3_0/> (literally Federal Council, the upper house of the German Federal Parliament) and in areas where they have legislative authority they have limited powers to conclude <b13_0><b14_0>international treaties<b14_0/><b13_0/> \"with the consent of <a4_0>the federal government<a4_0/>\"."}
