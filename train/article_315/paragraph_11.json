His proposal was turned down due to opposition of the states and concerns of the government.

In fact, until 1933 there were only <a3_0>four<a3_0/> changes in the configuration of the German states: The 7 Thuringian states were merged in 1920, whereby Coburg opted for Bavaria, Pyrmont joined Prussia in <a4_0>1922<a4_0/>, and Waldeck did so in 1929. Any later plans to break up the dominating Prussia into smaller states failed because political circumstances were not favorable to state reforms."}
