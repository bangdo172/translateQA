Bonaparte's brother, Joseph, led the complex negotiations in <a1_0>Lun\u00e9ville<a1_0/> and reported that Austria, emboldened by British support, would not acknowledge the new territory that France had acquired. As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Bonaparte gave orders to his general <a2_0>Moreau<a2_0/> to strike Austria once more. Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at <a4_0>Hohenlinden<a4_0/> in December 1800. As a result, the Austrians capitulated and signed <a3_0>the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville<a3_0/> in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio. Britain now remained the only nation that was still at war with France."}
