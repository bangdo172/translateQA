Metternich and Archduke Charles had the preservation of <a1_0>the Habsburg Empire<a1_0/> as their fundamental goal, and to this end they succeeded by making Napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of friendship between the two powers. Nevertheless, while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the Habsburg realm, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while <a2_0>Galicia<a2_0/> was given to the Poles and the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to <a3_0>the Bavarians<a3_0/>. Austria lost over <a4_0>three million<a4_0/> subjects, about one-fifth of her total population, as a result of these territorial changes. Although fighting in Iberia continued, the War of the Fifth Coalition would be the last major conflict on the European continent for the next three years."}
