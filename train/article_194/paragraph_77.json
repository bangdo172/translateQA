Napoleon synthesized the best academic elements from the Ancien R\u00e9gime, The Enlightenment, and the Revolution, with the aim of establishing a stable, well-educated and prosperous society. He made <a1_0>French<a1_0/> the only official language. He left some primary education in the hands of religious orders, but he offered <a2_0>public support<a2_0/> to secondary education. Napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools (<a3_0>lyc\u00e9es<a3_0/>) designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across France. All students were taught <a4_0>the sciences<a4_0/> along with modern and classical languages. Unlike the system during the Ancien R\u00e9gime, religious topics did not dominate the curriculum, although they were present in addition to teachers from the clergy. Napoleon simply hoped to use religion to produce social stability. He gave special attention to the advanced centers, notably the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, that provided both military expertise and state-of-the-art research in science. Napoleon made some of the first major efforts at establishing a system of secular and public education. The system featured scholarships and strict discipline, with the result being a French educational system that outperformed its European counterparts, many of which borrowed from the French system."}
