The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in <a1_0>Paris<a1_0/> when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauw\u00f6rth on the 17th to find the Grande Arm\u00e9e in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by <a2_0>75 miles (121 km)<a2_0/> and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated <a3_0>Landshut Maneuver<a3_0/>. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckm\u00fchl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting <a4_0>Battle of Eckm\u00fchl<a4_0/>, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany."}
