In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's <a2_0>hair<a2_0/> from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately <a3_0>100 times<a3_0/> higher than the current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives.[note 7] Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of <a0_0>arsenic poisoning<a0_0/>, and confirmed evidence of <a1_0>peptic ulcer and gastric cancer<a1_0/> as the cause of death."}
