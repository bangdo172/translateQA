The increased importance of artillery after <a1_0>1807<a1_0/> stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed <a2_0>artillery<a2_0/> as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. <a3_0>McConachy<a3_0/> rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained largely static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent significant change."}
