He intended to use this invasion force to strike at <a2_0>England<a2_0/>. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called <a3_0>La Grande Arm\u00e9e.<a3_0/> At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Arm\u00e9e countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Arm\u00e9e had grown to a force of <a4_0>350,000<a4_0/> men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers."}
