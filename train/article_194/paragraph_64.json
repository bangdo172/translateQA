During the campaign in Egypt, Napoleon showed much tolerance towards <a1_0>religion<a1_0/> for a revolutionary general, holding discussions with Muslim scholars and ordering religious celebrations, but General Dupuy, who accompanied Napoleon, revealed, shortly after <a2_0>Pope Pius VI<a2_0/>'s death, the political reasons for such behaviour: \"We are fooling Egyptians with our pretended interest for their religion; neither Bonaparte nor we believe in this religion more than we did in Pius the Defunct's one\".[note 8] In his memoirs, Bonaparte's secretary Bourienne wrote about Napoleon's religious interests in the same vein. His religious opportunism is epitomized in his famous quote: \"It is by making myself Catholic that I brought peace to Brittany and Vend\u00e9e. It is by making myself Italian that I won minds in Italy. It is by making myself a Moslem that I established myself in Egypt. If I governed a nation of Jews, I should reestablish the Temple of Solomon.\" However, according to <a3_0>Juan Cole<a3_0/>, \"Bonaparte's admiration for the Prophet Muhammad, in contrast, was genuine\" and during his captivity on St Helena he defended him against Voltaire's critical play Mahomet."}
