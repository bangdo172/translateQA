He drafted <a1_0>the Constitution of the Year VIII<a1_0/> and secured his own election as First Consul, taking up residence at <a2_0>the Tuileries.<a2_0/> The constitution was approved in a rigged plebiscite held the following January, with <a3_0>99.94<a3_0/> percent officially listed as voting \"yes.\" Napoleon's brother, Lucien, had falsified the returns to show that 3 million people had participated in the plebiscite; the real number was <a4_0>1.5 million<a4_0/>. Political observers at the time assumed the eligible French voting public numbered about 5 million people, so the regime artificially doubled the participation rate to indicate popular enthusiasm for the Consulate. In the first few months of the Consulate, with war in Europe still raging and internal instability still plaguing the country, Napoleon's grip on power remained very tenuous."}
