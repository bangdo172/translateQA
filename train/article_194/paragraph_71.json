He was often referred to by the British as <a1_0>Boney<a1_0/>. A nursery rhyme warned children that Bonaparte ravenously ate naughty people; the \"bogeyman\". The British <a2_0>Tory<a2_0/> press sometimes depicted Napoleon as much smaller than average height, and this image persists. Confusion about his height also results from the difference between the French pouce and British inch\u20142.71 cm and 2.54 cm, respectively. The myth of the \"Napoleon Complex\u201d \u2014 named after him to describe men who have an inferiority complex \u2014 stems primarily from the fact that he was listed, incorrectly, as <a3_0>5 feet 2 inches<a3_0/> (in French units) at the time of his death. In fact, he was 1.68 metres (<a4_0>5 ft 6 in<a4_0/>) tall, an average height for a man in that period.[note 11]"}
