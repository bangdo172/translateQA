YouTube typically takes <a1_0>45 percent<a1_0/> of the advertising revenue from <b6_0>videos in the Partner Program<b6_0/>, with <a4_0>55 percent<a4_0/> going to <b7_0>the uploader<b7_0/>. There are <a2_0><b8_0>over a million<a2_0/> members<b8_0/> of the YouTube Partner Program. According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers. Assuming pre-roll advertisements on half of videos, a YouTube partner would earn 0.5 X $7.60 X 55% = <a3_0>$2.09<a3_0/> per 1000 views in 2013."}
