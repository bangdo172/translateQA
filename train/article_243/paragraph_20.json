Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that <a1_0>an earthquake<a1_0/> had indeed struck 400 km (248 mi) to 500 km (310 mi) northwest of Luoyang (in what is now modern <a4_0>Gansu<a4_0/>). Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth' (<a2_0>Houfeng didong yi<a2_0/> \u5019\u98ce\u5730\u52a8\u4eea), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the <a3_0>enormous compression of trapped air<a3_0/>. See Zhang's seismometer for further details."}
