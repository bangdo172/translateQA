The Northern Renaissance, on the other hand, showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to <a3_0>chemistry and the biological sciences<a3_0/> (botany, anatomy, and medicine). Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation; the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus; the Fall of Constantinople; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same way that Martin Luther and John Calvin questioned religious doctrine. The works of Ptolemy (astronomy) and Galen (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations. Work by <a4_0>Vesalius<a4_0/> on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy."}
