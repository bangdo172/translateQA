After Jones, an effort to <a2_0>catalog all languages of the world<a2_0/> was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale created the development of descriptive linguistics. Descriptive linguistics, and the related structuralism movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. Noam Chomsky further diversified linguistics with <a3_0>the development of generative linguistics<a3_0/> in the 1950s. His effort is based upon <a4_0>a mathematical model of language<a4_0/> that allows for the description and prediction of valid syntax. Additional specialties such as sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, and computational linguistics have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines."}
