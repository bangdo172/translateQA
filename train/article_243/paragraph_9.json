Their development of <a1_0>deductive reasoning<a1_0/> was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry. Plato founded the Platonic Academy in <a2_0>387 BC<a2_0/>, whose motto was \"Let none unversed in geometry enter here\", and turned out many notable philosophers. Plato's student Aristotle introduced <a3_0>empiricism<a3_0/> and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction, thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method. Aristotle also produced many biological writings that were empirical in nature, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him, classified more than <a4_0>540<a4_0/> animal species, and dissected at least 50. Aristotle's writings profoundly influenced subsequent Islamic and European scholarship, though they were eventually superseded in the Scientific Revolution."}
