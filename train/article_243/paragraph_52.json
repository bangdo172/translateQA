Works such as <a3_0>Augustine of Hippo<a3_0/>'s The City of God synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of Christianity, redefining <a4_0>the borders between what was religious and what was political<a4_0/>. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between Church and State were clarified and contested in this period."}
