Meanwhile, the introduction of printing was to have great effect on <a2_0>European<a2_0/> society. The facilitated dissemination of the printed word democratized learning and allowed <a3_0>a faster propagation of new ideas<a3_0/>. New ideas also helped to influence the development of European science at this point: not least the introduction of <a4_0>Algebra<a4_0/>.
