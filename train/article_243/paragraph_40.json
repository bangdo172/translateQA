A decisive moment came when 'chymistry' was distinguished from alchemy by <a1_0>Robert Boyle<a1_0/> in his work <a2_0>The Sceptical Chymist<a2_0/>, in 1661; although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after his work. Other important steps included the gravimetric experimental practices of medical chemists like William Cullen, Joseph Black, Torbern Bergman and Pierre Macquer and through the work of Antoine Lavoisier (<a3_0>Father of Modern Chemistry<a3_0/>) on oxygen and the law of conservation of mass, which refuted <a4_0>phlogiston theory<a4_0/>. The theory that all matter is made of atoms, which are the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter, was provided by John Dalton in 1803, although the question took a hundred years to settle as proven. Dalton also formulated the law of mass relationships. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev composed his periodic table of elements on the basis of Dalton's discoveries."}
