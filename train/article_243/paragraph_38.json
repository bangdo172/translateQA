The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct in all circumstances. Beginning in 1900, Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and others developed <a0_0>quantum theories<a0_0/> to explain various anomalous experimental results, by introducing discrete energy levels. Not only did quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales, but even more disturbingly, the theory of general relativity, proposed by Einstein in <a1_0>1915<a1_0/>, showed that the fixed background of spacetime, on which both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity depended, could not exist. In 1925, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger formulated <a2_0>quantum mechanics<a2_0/>, which explained the preceding quantum theories. The observation by <a3_0>Edwin Hubble<a3_0/> in 1929 that the speed at which galaxies recede positively correlates with their distance, led to the understanding that the universe is expanding, and the formulation of <a4_0>the Big Bang theory<a4_0/> by Georges Lema\u00eetre."}
