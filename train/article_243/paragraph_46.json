This discovery predated <a2_0>the germ theory of disease<a2_0/>. However, Semmelweis' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon Joseph Lister, who in 1865 proved the principles of <a3_0>antisepsis<a3_0/>. Lister's work was based on the important findings by French biologist <a4_0>Louis Pasteur<a4_0/>. Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised one of the most important methods in preventive medicine, when in 1880 he produced a vaccine against rabies. Pasteur invented the process of pasteurization, to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods."}
