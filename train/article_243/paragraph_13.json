Pliny the Elder produced what is one of the largest encyclopedias of the natural world in <a1_0>77 AD<a1_0/>, and must be regarded as the rightful successor to Theophrastus. For example, he accurately describes <a2_0>the octahedral shape<a2_0/> of the diamond, and proceeds to mention that diamond dust is used by engravers <a3_0>to cut and polish other gems<a3_0/> owing to its great hardness. His recognition of the importance of crystal shape is a precursor to modern crystallography, while mention of numerous other minerals presages mineralogy. He also recognises that other minerals have characteristic crystal shapes, but in one example, confuses the crystal habit with the work of lapidaries. He was also the first to recognise that amber <a4_0>was a fossilized resin<a4_0/> from pine trees because he had seen samples with trapped insects within them."}
