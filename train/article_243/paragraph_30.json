Scholars such as Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme started to reinterpret elements of Aristotle's mechanics. In particular, Buridan developed the theory that <a1_0>impetus<a1_0/> was the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was a first step towards the modern concept of <a2_0>inertia<a2_0/>. The Oxford Calculators began to mathematically analyze <a3_0>the kinematics of motion<a3_0/>, making this analysis without considering the causes of motion."}
