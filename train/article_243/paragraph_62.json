A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by <a1_0>George Sarton's<a1_0/> publications, Introduction to the History of Science (1927) and the Isis journal (founded in 1912). Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as <a2_0>the history of great men and great ideas<a2_0/>. He shared with many of his contemporaries a <a3_0>Whiggish<a3_0/> belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by <a4_0>interested scientists and physicians<a4_0/> rather than professional historians. With the work of I. Bernard Cohen at Harvard, the history of science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945."}
