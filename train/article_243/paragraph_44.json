Beno\u00eet de Maillet and the Comte de Buffon saw the Earth as much older than the <a0_0>6,000 years<a0_0/> envisioned by biblical scholars. Jean-\u00c9tienne Guettard and Nicolas Desmarest hiked central France and recorded their observations on some of <a1_0>the first geological maps<a1_0/>. Aided by chemical experimentation, naturalists such as Scotland's John Walker, Sweden's Torbern Bergman, and Germany's Abraham Werner created <a2_0>comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals<a2_0/>\u2014a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century. These early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of Earth history that led James Hutton, Georges Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart, following in the steps of Steno, to argue that <a4_0>layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained<a4_0/>: a principle first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin. The use of <a3_0>index fossils<a3_0/> became a powerful tool for making geological maps, because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other, distant localities. Over the first half of the 19th century, geologists such as Charles Lyell, Adam Sedgwick, and Roderick Murchison applied the new technique to rocks throughout Europe and eastern North America, setting the stage for more detailed, government-funded mapping projects in later decades."}
