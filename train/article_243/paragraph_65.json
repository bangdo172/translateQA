It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that <a1_0>positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science<a1_0/>. As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of <a2_0>competing paradigms or conceptual systems<a2_0/> in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. \"Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific.\""}
