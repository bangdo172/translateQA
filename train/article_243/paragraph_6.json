Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used <a1_0>in Western calendars<a1_0/> such as the solar year and the lunar month. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of Kidinnu, <a2_0>a Chaldean astronomer and mathematician<a2_0/>. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for <a4_0>today's calendars<a4_0/>. Babylonian astronomy was \"the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena.\" According to the historian <a3_0>A. Aaboe<a3_0/>, \"all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the Hellenistic world, in India, in Islam, and in the West\u2014if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciences\u2014depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways.\""}
