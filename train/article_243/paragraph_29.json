By then, the natural philosophy contained in these texts began to be extended by notable scholastics such as Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus and Duns Scotus. Precursors of the modern scientific method, influenced by earlier contributions of the Islamic world, can be seen already in <a2_0>Grosseteste<a2_0/>'s emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by <a1_0>Bacon<a1_0/>, particularly in his Opus Majus. <a3_0>Pierre Duhem<a3_0/>'s provocative thesis of the Catholic Church's Condemnation of 1277 led to the study of medieval science as a serious discipline, \"but no one in the field any longer endorses his view that modern science started in 1277\". However, many scholars agree with Duhem's view that <a4_0>the Middle Ages<a4_0/> were a period of important scientific developments."}
