The first comprehensive theories of mountain building were proposed during this period, as were the first modern theories of earthquakes and volcanoes. <a1_0>Louis Agassiz<a1_0/> and others established the reality of continent-covering ice ages, and \"<a2_0>fluvialists<a2_0/>\" like Andrew Crombie Ramsay argued that river valleys <a3_0>were formed, over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them<a3_0/>. After the discovery of radioactivity, <a4_0>radiometric dating methods were developed<a4_0/>, starting in the 20th century. Alfred Wegener's theory of \"continental drift\" was widely dismissed when he proposed it in the 1910s, but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory of plate tectonics, which provided a plausible mechanism for it. Plate tectonics also provided a unified explanation for a wide range of seemingly unrelated geological phenomena. Since 1970 it has served as the unifying principle in geology."}
