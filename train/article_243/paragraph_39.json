Wheeler<a1_0/>. Further developments took place during <a2_0>World War II<a2_0/>, which led to the practical application of radar and the development and use of the atomic bomb. Though the process had begun with the invention of the cyclotron by Ernest O. Lawrence in the 1930s, physics in the postwar period entered into a phase of what historians have called \"<a3_0>Big Science<a3_0/>\", requiring massive machines, budgets, and laboratories in order to test their theories and move into new frontiers. The primary patron of physics became state governments, who recognized that the support of \"basic\" research could often lead to technologies useful to both military and industrial applications. Currently, general relativity and quantum mechanics are <a4_0>inconsistent with each other<a4_0/>, and efforts are underway to unify the two."}
