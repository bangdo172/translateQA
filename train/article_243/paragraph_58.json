Cognitive science again considers <a1_0>the mind<a1_0/> as a subject for investigation, using the tools of psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and neurobiology. New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain, such as <a2_0>PET scans and CAT scans<a2_0/>, began to exert their influence as well, leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain, rather than cognition. These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as <a3_0>artificial intelligence<a3_0/>."}
