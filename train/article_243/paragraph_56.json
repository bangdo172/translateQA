The \"invisible hand\" mentioned in a lost page in the middle of a chapter in the middle of the to \"Wealth of Nations\", <a0_0>1776<a0_0/>, advances as Smith's central message.[clarification needed] It is played down that this \"invisible hand\" acts only \"<a1_0>frequently<a1_0/>\" and that it is \"no part of his [the individual's] intentions\" because competition leads to <a2_0>lower prices<a2_0/> by imitating \"his\" invention.
