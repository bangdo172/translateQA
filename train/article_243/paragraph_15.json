In 628 AD, Brahmagupta suggested that <a2_0>gravity was a force of attraction<a2_0/>. He also lucidly explained the use of zero as both <a3_0>a placeholder and a decimal digit<a3_0/>, along with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally throughout the world. <a4_0>Arabic<a4_0/> translations of the two astronomers' texts were soon available in the Islamic world, introducing what would become Arabic numerals to the Islamic World by the 9th century. During the 14th\u201316th centuries, the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics made significant advances in astronomy and especially mathematics, including fields such as trigonometry and analysis. In particular, Madhava of Sangamagrama is considered the \"founder of mathematical analysis\"."}
