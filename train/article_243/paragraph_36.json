This was followed by the first known model of <a2_0>planetary motion<a2_0/> given by Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century, which proposed that <a3_0>the planets follow elliptical orbits<a3_0/>, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. Galileo (\"<a4_0>Father of Modern Physics<a4_0/>\") also made use of experiments to validate physical theories, a key element of the scientific method."}
