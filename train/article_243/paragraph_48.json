Equally important in the rise of ecology, however, were microbiology and soil science\u2014particularly <a1_0>the cycle of life concept<a1_0/>, prominent in the work Louis Pasteur and Ferdinand Cohn. The word ecology was coined by <a2_0>Ernst Haeckel<a2_0/>, whose particularly holistic view of nature in general (and Darwin's theory in particular) was important in the spread of ecological thinking. In the 1930s, Arthur Tansley and others began developing the field of ecosystem ecology, which combined experimental soil science with physiological concepts of energy and the techniques of field biology. The history of ecology in the 20th century is closely tied to that of environmentalism; the Gaia hypothesis, first formulated <a3_0>in the 1960s<a3_0/>, and spreading in the 1970s, and more recently the scientific-religious movement of <a4_0>Deep Ecology<a4_0/> have brought the two closer together."}
