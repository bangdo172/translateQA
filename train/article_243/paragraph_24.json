This led to an early scientific method being developed in the Muslim world, where significant progress in methodology was made, beginning with the experiments of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) on optics from c. 1000, in his <a1_0>Book of Optics<a1_0/>. <a2_0>The law of refraction of light<a2_0/> was known to the Persians. The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally empirical orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as <a3_0>the father of optics<a3_0/>, especially for his empirical proof of <a4_0>the intromission theory of light<a4_0/>. Some have also described Ibn al-Haytham as the \"first scientist\" for his development of the modern scientific method."}
