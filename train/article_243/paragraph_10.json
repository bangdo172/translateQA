In <a1_0>the Hellenistic age<a1_0/> scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of mathematics and <a4_0>deliberate empirical research<a4_0/>, in their scientific investigations. Thus, clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers, to medieval Muslim philosophers and scientists, to the European Renaissance and Enlightenment, to the secular sciences of the modern day.
