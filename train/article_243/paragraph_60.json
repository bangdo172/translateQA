This structural functionalism approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for <a2_0>inequalities present in the status quo<a2_0/>. In reaction, <a3_0>conflict theory<a3_0/> was developed, which was based in part on the philosophies of Karl Marx. Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which <a4_0>different groups compete for control over resources<a4_0/>. Symbolic interactionism also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking. Erving Goffman saw social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing \"backstage\" and attempting to control their audience through impression management. While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought, other approaches exist, including feminist theory, post-structuralism, rational choice theory, and postmodernism."}
