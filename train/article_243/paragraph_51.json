In this treatise, the behaviors and relationships of the people, the King, the State, the Government Superintendents, Courtiers, Enemies, Invaders, and Corporations are analysed and documented. Roger Boesche describes the Artha\u015b\u0101stra as \"a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes <a1_0>brutal measures<a1_0/> he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good.\""}
