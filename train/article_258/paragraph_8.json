Other estimates are of at least <a2_0>30,000 to 40,000<a2_0/> protestors with 5,000 arrested and jailed, and an unknown number of casualties. Jeltoqsan leaders say over 60,000 Kazakhs participated in the protests. According to the Kazakh SSR government, there were two deaths during the riots, including a volunteer police worker and a student. Both of them had died due to <a3_0>blows to the head<a3_0/>. About 100 others were detained and several others were sentenced to terms in labor camps.
