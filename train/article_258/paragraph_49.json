Gorbachev resolved to regain control of Azerbaijan; the events that ensued are known as \"<a3_0>Black January<a3_0/>.\" Late on January 19, 1990, after blowing up the central television station and cutting the phone and radio lines, <a4_0>26,000<a4_0/> Soviet troops entered the Azerbaijani capital Baku, smashing barricades, attacking protesters, and firing into crowds.

More than 700 civilians were wounded, hundreds were detained, but only a few were actually tried for alleged criminal offenses."}
