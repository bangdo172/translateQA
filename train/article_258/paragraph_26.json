This example fueled a limited experiment with democracy in Poland, which quickly led to the toppling of the Communist government in <a2_0>Warsaw<a2_0/> that summer \u2013 which in turn sparked uprisings that overthrew communism in the other five Warsaw Pact countries before the end of <a3_0>1989<a3_0/>, the year the Berlin Wall fell. These events showed that the people of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union did not support Gorbachev's drive to modernize Communism; rather, they preferred to <a4_0>abandon it<a4_0/> altogether."}
