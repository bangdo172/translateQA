In the streets, the center of public manifestations was the <a1_0>Stephen the Great Monument<a1_0/> in <a2_0>Chi\u015fin\u0103u<a2_0/>, and the adjacent park harboring Aleea Clasicilor (The \"Alee of the Classics [of the Literature]\"). On January 15, 1988, in a tribute to Mihai Eminescu at his bust on the Aleea Clasicilor, Anatol \u015ealaru submitted a proposal to continue the meetings. In the public discourse, the movement called for national awakening, freedom of speech, revival of Moldavian traditions, and for attainment of official status for the <a3_0>Romanian<a3_0/> language and return to the Latin alphabet. The transition from \"movement\" (an informal association) to \"front\" (a formal association) was seen as a natural \"upgrade\" once a movement gained momentum with the public, and the Soviet authorities no longer dared to crack down on it."}
