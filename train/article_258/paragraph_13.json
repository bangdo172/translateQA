Signatures were collected in Tartu, and students assembled in the university's main hall to express lack of confidence in the government. At a demonstration on May 1, 1987, young people showed up with banners and slogans despite an official ban. On August 15, 1987, former political prisoners formed the <a2_0>MRP-AEG group<a2_0/> (Estonians for the Public Disclosure of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), which was headed by <a3_0>Tiit Madisson<a3_0/>. In September 1987, the Edasi newspaper published a proposal by Edgar Savisaar, Siim Kallas, Tiit Made, and Mikk Titma calling for Estonia's transition to <a4_0>autonomy<a4_0/>. Initially geared toward economic independence, then toward a certain amount of political autonomy, the project, Isemajandav Eesti (\"A Self-Managing Estonia\") became known according to its Estonian acronym, IME, which means \"miracle\". On October 21, a demonstration dedicated to those who gave their lives in the 1918\u20131920 Estonian War of Independence took place in V\u00f5ru, which culminated in a conflict with the militia. For the first time in years, the blue, black, and white national tricolor was publicly displayed."}
