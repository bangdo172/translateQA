CAF members in operational occupations generally wear the DEU to which their occupation \"belongs.\" CAF members in <b1_0>non-operational occupations<b1_0/> (the \"purple\" trades) are allocated a uniform according to the \"distribution\" of their branch within the <b3_0>CAF<b3_0/>, association of the branch with one of the former services, and the individual's initial preference. Therefore, on any given day, in any given CAF unit, all three coloured uniforms may be seen."}
