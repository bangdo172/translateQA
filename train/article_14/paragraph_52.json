Members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, including pro-democracy activist Szeto Wah, waved novelty inflatable <a0_0>plastic Olympic flames<a0_0/>, which they said symbolised <a5_0>democracy.<a5_0/> They wanted accountability for the <a1_0>Tiananmen Square protests<a1_0/> of 1989 and the implementation of democracy in Hong Kong. Political activist and Legislative Council member <a6_0>Leung Kwok-hung<a6_0/> (Longhair) also joined the protest, saying \"I'm very proud that in Hong Kong we still have people brave enough to speak out.\" Pro-democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch supporters with insults like \"running dog,\" \"traitor,\" \"get out!,\" and \"I love the Communist Party.\" At the same time, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage. Onlookers were saying \"Aren't you Chinese?\" in Mandarin putonghua as they tried to cover the orange banners with a large Chinese national flag. One woman had an orange sign that said, \"Olympic flame for democracy\", while a man carried a poster with a tank and the slogan \"One world, two dreams\". A university student and former RDHK radio host <a2_0>Christina Chan<a2_0/> wrapped the <a7_0>Tibetan snow lion flag<a7_0/> around her body and later began waving it. Several onlookers heckled Chan, shouting \"What kind of Chinese are you?\" and \"What a shame!\" In the end, she and some of the protesters were taken away against their will by the authorities via a <a3_0>police<a3_0/> vehicle \"for their own protection.\" Chan is currently[when?] suing the Hong Kong government, claiming <a4_0>her human rights were breached.<a4_0/> (case number HCAL139/08)"}
