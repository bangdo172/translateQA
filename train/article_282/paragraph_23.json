Streets, boulevards and avenues are homogeneous, surprisingly high (up to <a4_0><b9_0>seven stories<b9_0/><a4_0/>) and broad examples of German urban lay-out and of this architectural style that summons and mixes up five centuries of European architecture as well as <b5_0>Neo-Egyptian<b5_0/>, Neo-Greek and <b6_0>Neo-Babylonian<b6_0/> styles. The former imperial palace <a2_0>Palais du Rhin<a2_0/>, the most political and thus heavily criticized of all German Strasbourg buildings epitomizes the grand scale and stylistic sturdiness of this period. But the two most handsome and ornate buildings of these times are the \u00c9cole internationale des Pontonniers (the former <a3_0>H\u00f6here M\u00e4dchenschule<a3_0/>, <b8_0>girls college<b8_0/>) with its towers, turrets and multiple round and square angles and the \u00c9cole des Arts d\u00e9coratifs with its lavishly ornate fa\u00e7ade of <b7_0>painted bricks, woodwork and majolica<b7_0/>."}
