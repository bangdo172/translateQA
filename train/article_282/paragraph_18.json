It was composed by a group of 25 young men aged from 14 to 18 years old who led several attacks against the German occupation. The actions culminated with the attack of the <a1_0>Gauleiter Robert Wagner<a1_0/>, the highest commander of Alsace directly under the order of Hitler. In March 1942, Marcel Weinum was prosecuted by the Gestapo and sentenced to be <a2_0>beheaded<a2_0/> at the age of 18 in <b6_0>April 1942<b6_0/> in Stuttgart, Germany. His last words will be: \"If I have to die, I shall die but with a pure heart\". From 1943 the city was bombarded by <a3_0>Allied aircraft<a3_0/>. While the First World War had not notably damaged the city, Anglo-American bombing caused extensive destruction in raids of which at least one was allegedly carried out by mistake. In August 1944, several buildings in the Old Town were damaged by bombs, particularly the Palais Rohan, the Old Customs House (Ancienne Douane) and the Cathedral. On <a4_0><b9_0>23 November 1944<b9_0/><a4_0/>, the city was officially liberated by the 2nd <b7_0>French<b7_0/> Armoured Division under <b8_0>General Leclerc<b8_0/>. He achieved the oath that he made with his soldiers, after the decisive Capture of Kufra. With the Oath of Kuffra, they swore to keep up the fight until the French flag flew over the Cathedral of Strasbourg."}
