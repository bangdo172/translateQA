Many tried to escape from the incorporation, join the French Resistance, or desert the Wehrmacht but many couldn't because they were running the risk of having their families sent to work or concentration camps by the <a1_0>Germans<a1_0/>. Many of these men, especially those who did not answer the call immediately, were pressured to \"volunteer\" for service with the SS, often by direct threats on their families. This threat obliged the majority of them to remain in the German army. After the war, the few that survived were often accused of being traitors or collaborationists, because this tough situation was not known in the rest of France, and they had to face the incomprehension of many. In July <b5_0>1944<b5_0/>, <b6_0><b8_0>1500<b8_0/><b6_0/> malgr\u00e9-nous were released from Soviet captivity and sent to <a2_0>Algiers<a2_0/>, where they joined the Free French Forces. Nowadays history recognizes the suffering of those people, and museums, public discussions and memorials have been built to commemorate this terrible period of history of this part of Eastern France (Alsace and Moselle).
