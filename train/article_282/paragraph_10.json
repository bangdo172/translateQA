During this time, many churches and monasteries were either destroyed or severely damaged. The cathedral lost hundreds of its <a2_0>statues<a2_0/> (later replaced by copies in the 19th century) and in April <b5_0><b8_0>1794<b8_0/><b5_0/>, there was talk of tearing its spire down, on the grounds that it was against the principle of equality. The tower was saved, however, when in May of the same year citizens of Strasbourg crowned it with a giant <a3_0>tin<a3_0/> Phrygian cap.
