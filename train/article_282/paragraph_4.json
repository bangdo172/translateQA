The outline of the Roman \"castrum\" is visible in the street pattern in the Grande Ile. Many <a0_0>Roman artifacts<a0_0/> have also been found along the current Route des Romains, the road that led to Argentoratum, in the suburb of K\u0153nigshoffen. This was where the largest burial places were situated, as well as the densest concentration of civilian dwelling places and commerces next to the camp. Among the most outstanding finds in K\u0153nigshoffen were (found in 1911\u201312) the fragments of a grand Mithraeum that had been shattered by early <a2_0>Christians<a2_0/> in the fourth century. From the fourth century, Strasbourg was the seat of the Bishopric of Strasbourg (made an Archbishopric in <a3_0><b7_0>1988<b7_0/><a3_0/>). Archaeological excavations below the current \u00c9glise Saint-\u00c9tienne in <b5_0><b6_0>1948<b6_0/><b5_0/> and <b4_0>1956<b4_0/> unearthed the apse of <b8_0>a church<b8_0/> dating back to the late fourth or early fifth century, considered to be the oldest church in Alsace. It is supposed that this was the first seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Strasbourg."}
