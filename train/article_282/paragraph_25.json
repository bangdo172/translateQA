The Jardin botanique de l'Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg (botanical garden) was created under the German administration next to the Observatory of Strasbourg, built in <a3_0><b5_0>1881<b5_0/><a3_0/>, and still owns some greenhouses of those times. The <a4_0>Parc des Contades<a4_0/>, although the oldest park of the city, was completely remodeled after World War II. The futuristic Parc des Poteries is an example of European park-conception in the late 1990s. The Jardin des deux Rives, spread over Strasbourg and Kehl on both sides of the Rhine opened in 2004 and is the most extended (60-hectare) park of the agglomeration. The most recent park is <b7_0>Parc du Heyritz<b7_0/> (<b6_0>8,7 ha<b6_0/>), opened in 2014 along a canal facing the h\u00f4pital civil."}
