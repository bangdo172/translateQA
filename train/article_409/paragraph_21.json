Red, green and blue light combined together makes <a1_0>white<a1_0/> light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television. For example, purple on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to used by Cennino Cennini in <a3_0>the <b8_0>Renaissance<b8_0/><a3_0/> to make <b7_0>violet<b7_0/>, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment: it is created by combining <a4_0>red and blue<a4_0/> light at equal intensity on a black screen. Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light."}
