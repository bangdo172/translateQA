Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, <a1_0>scatter <b5_0>more strongly<b5_0/><a1_0/>, and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye. At sunrise and sunset, when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the <b6_0>blue and green<b6_0/> components are <a2_0>removed almost completely<a2_0/>, leaving the <a3_0>longer<a3_0/> wavelength <b7_0>orange and red<b7_0/> light. The remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the horizon its red glow."}
