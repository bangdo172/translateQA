The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of <a2_0><b6_0>iron oxide<b6_0/><a2_0/>. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as <a3_0><b7_0>Rayleigh scattering<b7_0/><a3_0/>, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called <a4_0><b8_0>anthocyanins<b8_0/><a4_0/>, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. <b9_0>One to two percent<b9_0/> of the human population has red hair; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin."}
