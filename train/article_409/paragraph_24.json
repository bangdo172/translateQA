In <a1_0>1962<a1_0/> the <b6_0>red helium\u2013neon laser<b6_0/> was invented, and these two types of lasers were widely used in many scientific applications including holography, and in education. <a2_0>Red helium\u2013neon<a2_0/> lasers were used commercially in LaserDisc players. The use of red laser diodes became widespread with the commercial success of <b7_0>modern DVD players<b7_0/>, which use <a3_0>a 660 nm laser<a3_0/> diode technology. Today, red and red-orange laser diodes are widely available to the public in the form of extremely inexpensive laser pointers. Portable, high-powered versions are also available for various applications. More recently, <a4_0>671 nm <b8_0><b9_0>diode-pumped solid state<b9_0/> (DPSS) lasers<b8_0/><a4_0/> have been introduced to the market for all-DPSS laser display systems, particle image velocimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and holography."}
