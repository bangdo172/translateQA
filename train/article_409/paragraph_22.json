The sRGB number of <b7_0>pure red<b7_0/>, for example, is <a2_0>255, 00, 00<a2_0/>, which means the red component is at its maximum intensity, and there is no green or blue. The sRGB number for <b8_0>crimson<b8_0/> is <a3_0>220, 20, 60<a3_0/>, which means that the red is slightly less intense and therefore darker, there is some green, which leans it toward orange; and there is a larger amount of blue,which makes it slightly blue-violet."}
