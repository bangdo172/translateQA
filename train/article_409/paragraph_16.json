Beginning in <a1_0>the 1740s<a1_0/>, this <b7_0>bright red color was used to dye or print cotton<b7_0/> textiles in England, the Netherlands and France. Turkey red used <a2_0>madder<a2_0/> as the colorant, but the process was longer and more complicated, involving multiple soaking of the fabrics in lye, olive oil, sheep's dung, and other ingredients. The fabric was more expensive but resulted in a fine bright and lasting red, similar to <a3_0>carmine<a3_0/>, perfectly suited to cotton. The fabric was widely exported from Europe to Africa, the Middle East and America. In <a4_0>19th<a4_0/> century America, it was widely used in <b8_0>making the traditional patchwork quilt<b8_0/>."}
