For example, in mandrills, red coloration of <a0_0>the face<a0_0/> is greatest in alpha males, increasingly less prominent in lower ranking subordinates, and directly correlated with levels of <a4_0>testosterone<a4_0/>. Red can also affect the perception of <b8_0>dominance<b8_0/> by others, leading to significant differences in mortality, reproductive success and parental investment between individuals displaying red and those not. In humans, wearing red has been linked with <a1_0><b7_0>increased performance<a1_0/> in competitions, including professional sport and multiplayer video games<b7_0/>. Controlled tests have demonstrated that wearing red does not increase performance or levels of testosterone during exercise, so the effect is likely to be produced by perceived rather than actual performance.
