The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of <a0_0>Christ's blood<a0_0/> (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire. The British flag bears the colors <b6_0>red, white, and blue<b6_0/>; it includes <a1_0>the cross of Saint George<a1_0/>, <a2_0>patron saint of England<a2_0/>, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Venezuela, also feature <b7_0>red<b7_0/>-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners. Red flags are also used to symbolize storms, <a4_0>bad water conditions<a4_0/>, and many other dangers. Navy flags are often <b9_0>red and yellow<b9_0/>. <b8_0>Red<b8_0/> is prominently featured in the flag of <a3_0>the United States Marine Corps<a3_0/>."}
