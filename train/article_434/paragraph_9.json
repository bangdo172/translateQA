The front is most pronounced in the Lewis Range, located primarily in Glacier National Park. Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the Northern Divide (which begins in Alaska's Seward Peninsula) crosses this region and turns east in Montana at Triple Divide Peak. It causes the Waterton River, Belly, and Saint Mary rivers to flow <a0_0>north<a0_0/> into Alberta, Canada. There they join the Saskatchewan River, which ultimately empties into <a1_0>Hudson Bay."}
