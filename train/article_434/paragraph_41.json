Hill<a0_0/> of the Great Northern began promoting settlement in the Montana prairie to fill his trains with settlers and goods. Other railroads followed suit. In <a1_0>1902<a1_0/>, the Reclamation Act was passed, allowing irrigation projects to be built in Montana's eastern river valleys. In <a2_0>1909<a2_0/>, Congress passed the Enlarged Homestead Act that expanded the amount of free land from 160 to <a3_0>320 acres<a3_0/> (0.6 to 1.3 km2) per family and in 1912 reduced the time to \"prove up\" on a claim to three years. In 1916, the Stock-Raising Homestead Act allowed homesteads of 640 acres in areas unsuitable for irrigation.  This combination of advertising and changes in the Homestead Act drew tens of thousands of homesteaders, lured by free land, with World War I bringing particularly high wheat prices. In addition, Montana was going through a temporary period of higher-than-average precipitation. Homesteaders arriving in this period were known as \"Honyockers\", or \"scissorbills.\" Though the word \"honyocker\", possibly derived from the ethnic slur \"hunyak,\" was applied in a derisive manner at homesteaders as being \"greenhorns\", \"new at his business\" or \"unprepared\", the reality was that a majority of these new settlers had previous farming experience, though there were also many who did not."}
