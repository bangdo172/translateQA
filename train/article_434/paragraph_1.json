The state tree, the ponderosa pine, was selected by Montana schoolchildren as the preferred state tree by an overwhelming majority in a referendum held in <a0_0>1908<a0_0/>. However, the legislature did not designate a state tree until <a1_0>1949<a1_0/>, when the Montana Federation of Garden Clubs, with the support of the state forester, lobbied for formal recognition. Schoolchildren also chose the western meadowlark as the state bird, in a 1930 vote, and the legislature acted to endorse this decision in 1931. Similarly, the secretary of state sponsored a children's vote in <a2_0>1981<a2_0/> to choose a state animal, and after 74 animals were nominated, the <a3_0>grizzly bear<a3_0/> won over the elk by a 2\u20131 margin. The students of Livingston started a statewide school petition drive plus lobbied the governor and the state legislature to name the <a4_0>Maiasaura<a4_0/> as the state fossil in 1985."}
