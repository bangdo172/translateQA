Since a conservative (such as the Republican Party) and liberal (such as the Democratic Party) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called <a1_0>Federalist and Republican<a1_0/>, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for <a2_0><b7_0>two decades<b7_0/><a2_0/> before they split over <b6_0>the spread of slavery<b6_0/>, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the <a4_0>Democratic Party<a4_0/>. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties <b8_0>siphoning votes<b8_0/> from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of <b5_0>1912<b5_0/> and George Wallace in the election of 1968). As third party movements have learned, the Electoral College's requirement of a nationally distributed majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed. Thus, such parties rarely win many electoral votes, although their popular support within a state may tip it toward one party or the other. Wallace had <b9_0>weak support<b9_0/> outside the South. More generally, parties with a broad base of support across regions or among economic and other interest groups, have a great chance of winning the necessary plurality in the U.S.'s largely single-member district, winner-take-all elections. The <a3_0>tremendous land area and large population of the country<a3_0/> are formidable challenges to political parties with a narrow appeal."}
