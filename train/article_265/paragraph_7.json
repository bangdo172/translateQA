The Home Rule League Party, campaigning for Home Rule for Ireland in the British Parliament was fundamentally changed by the great Irish political leader <a0_0>Charles Stewart Parnell<a0_0/> <b3_0>in the 1880s<b3_0/>. In 1882, he changed his party's name to <b4_0>the <a1_0>Irish Parliamentary Party<b4_0/><a1_0/> and created a well-organized grass roots structure, introducing membership to replace <b5_0>\"ad hoc\" informal groupings<b5_0/>. He created <b6_0>a new selection procedure<b6_0/> to ensure the professional selection of party candidates committed to taking their seats, and in 1884 he imposed <b7_0>a firm 'party pledge'<b7_0/> which obliged MPs to vote as a bloc in parliament on all occasions. The creation of a strict party whip and a formal party structure was unique at the time. His party's efficient structure and control contrasted with the loose rules and flexible informality found in the main British parties; \u2013 <a2_0>they soon came to model themselves on the Parnellite model."}
