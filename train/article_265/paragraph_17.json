This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland <b6_0>since the 1980s<b6_0/> and is almost always the case in <b7_0>Germany<b7_0/> on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, <a1_0>since the forming of <b8_0>the Republic of Iceland<b8_0/> there has never been a government not led by a coalition<a1_0/> (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since <a2_0>1989<a2_0/>, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael. <a3_0>Political change is often easier with a coalition government<a3_0/> than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, <a4_0>post World War II <b9_0>France and Italy<b9_0/><a4_0/> being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama briefly had such an advantage between 2009 and 2011."}
