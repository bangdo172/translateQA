International donors <a1_0>provide financing to political parties in developing countries<a1_0/> as a means to promote <b8_0>democracy and good governance<b8_0/>. Support can be purely financial or otherwise. Frequently it is provided as capacity development activities including the <b5_0>development of party manifestos, party constitutions and campaigning skills<b5_0/>. <a2_0>Developing links between ideologically linked parties<a2_0/> is another common feature of international support for a party. Sometimes this can be perceived as directly supporting the political aims of a political party, such as the support of the US government to the Georgian party behind the Rose Revolution. Other donors work on a more neutral basis, where multiple donors provide grants in countries accessible by all parties for various aims defined by the recipients.
