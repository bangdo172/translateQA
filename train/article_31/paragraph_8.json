The first programme broadcast \u2013 and thus the first ever, on a dedicated TV channel \u2013 was \"<a2_0>Opening of the BBC Television Service<a2_0/>\" at 15:00. The first major outside broadcast was the <b8_0>coronation of <a3_0>King George VI and Queen Elizabeth<b8_0/><a3_0/> in May 1937. The service was reaching an estimated 25,000\u201340,000 homes before the outbreak of World War II which caused the <b9_0>service to be suspended<b9_0/> in <a4_0>September 1939<a4_0/>. The VHF broadcasts would have provided an ideal radio beacon for German bombers homing in on London, and the engineers and technicians of the service would be needed for the war effort, in particular the radar programme."}
