Some districts of the city are divided by the mountains themselves. Historically, it was relatively difficult to reach the inner part of Sicily from the city because of the <b5_0>mounts<b5_0/>. The tallest peak of the range is <a2_0><b6_0>La Pizzuta<b6_0/><a2_0/>, about 1,333 m (4,373 ft.) high. However, historically, the most important mount is <b7_0>Monte Pellegrino<b7_0/>, which is <a3_0>geographically separated from the rest of the range by a plain<a3_0/>. The mount lies right in front of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Monte Pellegrino's cliff was described in the 19th century by <a1_0><b8_0>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,<b8_0/><a1_0/> as \"The most beautiful promontory in the world\", in his essay \"Italian Journey\"."}
