A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the <a1_0>Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio<a1_0/>, and others. In the early twentieth century Palermo expanded <b8_0>outside the old city walls<b8_0/>, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libert\u00e0. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the <a2_0>Art Nouveau<a2_0/> style. Many of these were designed by the famous architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge <a3_0>Teatro Massimo<a3_0/> was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, and built by the Rutelli & Mach\u00ec building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897."}
