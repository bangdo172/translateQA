", "id": "570c78d9fed7b91900d459df", "answers": [{"text": "financial sponsorships", "answer_start": 632}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "Prior to the 2011\u20132012 season, Barcelona had a long history of avoiding corporate sponsorship on the playing shirts. On 14 July 2006, the club announced a five-year agreement with <a0_0>UNICEF<a0_0/>, which includes having the UNICEF logo on their shirts. The agreement had the club donate <a1_0>\u20ac1.5 million<a1_0/> per year to UNICEF (0.7 percent of its ordinary income, equal to the <a2_0>UN International Aid Target<a2_0/>, cf. ODA) via the FC Barcelona Foundation. The FC Barcelona Foundation is an entity set up in 1994 on the suggestion of then-chairman of the Economical-Statutory Committee, <a3_0>Jaime Gil-Aluja<a3_0/>. The idea was to set up a foundation that could attract <a4_0>financial sponsorships<a4_0/> to support a non-profit sport company. In 2004, a company could become one of 25 \"Honorary members\" by contributing between \u00a340,000\u201360,000 (\u00a354,800\u201382,300) per year. There are also 48 associate memberships available for an annual fee of \u00a314,000 (\u00a319,200) and an unlimited number of \"patronages\" for the cost of \u00a34,000 per year (\u00a35,500). It is unclear whether the honorary members have any formal say in club policy, but according to the author Anthony King, it is \"unlikely that Honorary Membership would not involve at least some informal influence over the club\"."}
