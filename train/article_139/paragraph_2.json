Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over <a1_0>Real Madrid<a1_0/> because he could not play for a club associated with <a2_0>Francisco Franco<a2_0/>. He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George. Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973\u201374 season for the first time since 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5\u20130 at the Bernab\u00e9u along the way. He was crowned <a3_0>European Footballer of the Year<a3_0/> in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in <a4_0>1974<a4_0/>, while he was still with Barcelona."}
