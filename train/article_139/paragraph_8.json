He was dubbed the <a2_0>martyr<a2_0/> of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the <a3_0>Second Spanish Republic<a3_0/>.
