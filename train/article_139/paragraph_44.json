Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals <a0_0>Real Madrid<a0_0/>, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely <a1_0>hostile<a1_0/> reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in <a2_0>decline<a2_0/>, and managers came and went. van Gaal was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Louis van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as <a3_0>15th<a3_0/> in February 2003. This led to van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Anti\u0107, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Anti\u0107's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president <a4_0>Joan Gaspart<a4_0/> resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior."}
