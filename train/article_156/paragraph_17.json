Previous hypotheses emphasized that <a0_0><b5_0><b6_0>photosensitive<b5_0/> proteins<a0_0/> and circadian rhythms<b6_0/> may have originated together in the earliest cells, with the purpose of protecting <a1_0>replicating <b7_0>DNA<b7_0/><a1_0/> from high levels of damaging <a2_0>ultraviolet radiation<a2_0/> during the daytime. As a result, replication was relegated to the dark. However, evidence for this is lacking, since the simplest organisms with a circadian rhythm, the <b8_0>cyanobacteria<b8_0/>, do the opposite of this - they divide more in the daytime. Recent studies instead highlight the importance of co-evolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the <a4_0><b9_0>Great Oxidation Event<b9_0/><a4_0/> approximately 2.3 billion years ago. The current view is that circadian changes in environmental oxygen levels and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of daylight are likely to have driven a need to evolve circadian rhythms to preempt, and therefore counteract, damaging <a3_0>redox reactions<a3_0/> on a daily basis."}
