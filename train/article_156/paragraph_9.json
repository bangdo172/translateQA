Its onset in dim light, dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO), at roughly 21:00 (<a1_0>9 p.m<a1_0/>.) can be measured in the blood or the saliva. Its major metabolite can also be measured in morning urine. Both DLMO and the midpoint (in time) of the presence of the <a3_0>hormone<a3_0/> in the blood or saliva have been used as circadian markers. However, newer research indicates that the melatonin offset may be the more reliable marker. Benloucif et al. found that <a4_0>melatonin phase<a4_0/> markers were more stable and more highly correlated with <b8_0>the timing of sleep<b8_0/> than the <b7_0>core temperature minimum<b7_0/>. They found that both sleep offset and melatonin offset are more strongly correlated with phase markers than the onset of sleep. In addition, the declining phase of the melatonin levels is more reliable and stable than the termination of melatonin synthesis."}
