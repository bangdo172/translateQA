Behaviors showing rhythms include <b5_0>leaf movement, growth, germination, stomatal/gas exchange, enzyme activity, photosynthetic activity, and fragrance emission<b5_0/>, among others. Circadian rhythms occur as <b7_0>a plant<b7_0/> entrains to synchronize with the <a2_0>light cycle<a2_0/> of its surrounding environment. These <b6_0>rhythms<b6_0/> are endogenously generated and self-sustaining and are relatively constant over a range of ambient temperatures. Important features include two interacting transcription-translation feedback loops: proteins containing PAS domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions; and several photoreceptors that fine-tune the clock to different light conditions. <a3_0>Anticipation of changes<a3_0/> in the environment allows appropriate changes in a plant's physiological state, conferring an adaptive advantage. A better understanding of plant circadian rhythms has applications in <a4_0>agriculture<a4_0/>, such as helping farmers stagger crop harvests to extend crop availability and securing against massive losses due to weather."}
