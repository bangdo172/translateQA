Red and blue light are absorbed through <b5_0>several <a2_0>phytochromes and cryptochromes<b5_0/><a2_0/>. One phytochrome, <a3_0><b6_0>phyA<b6_0/><a3_0/>, is the main phytochrome in <b7_0>seedlings grown in the dark<b7_0/> but rapidly degrades in light to produce Cry1. <b8_0>Phytochromes B\u2013E<b8_0/> are more stable with <a4_0>phyB<a4_0/>, the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the light. The cryptochrome (cry) gene is also a light-sensitive component of the circadian clock and is thought to be involved both as a photoreceptor and as part of the clock's endogenous pacemaker mechanism. Cryptochromes 1\u20132 (involved in blue\u2013UVA) help to maintain the period length in the clock through a whole range of light conditions."}
