Though variation is great among normal chronotypes, the average human adult's temperature reaches its minimum at about <a1_0>05:00<a1_0/> (5 a.m.), about <a2_0>two hours<a2_0/> before habitual wake time. Baehr et al. found that, in young adults, the daily <b6_0><b7_0>body temperature minimum<b7_0/><b6_0/> occurred at about <a3_0>04:00<a3_0/> (4 a.m.) for morning types but at about <a4_0>06:00<a4_0/> (6 a.m.) for evening types. This minimum occurred at approximately the middle of the eight hour sleep period for <b8_0>morning types<b8_0/>, but closer to waking in evening types."}
