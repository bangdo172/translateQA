This was shown by Gene Block in isolated mollusk BRNs.[clarification needed] At the same time, <b6_0>different cells may communicate with each other<b6_0/> resulting in a synchronised output of electrical signaling. These may interface with <a2_0><b7_0>endocrine<b7_0/> glands<a2_0/> of the brain to result in periodic release of hormones. The receptors for these hormones may be located <b8_0>far across the body<b8_0/> and <a4_0>synchronise<a4_0/> the peripheral clocks of various organs. Thus, the information of the time of the day as relayed by the eyes travels to the clock in the brain, and, through that, clocks in the rest of the body may be synchronised. This is how the timing of, for example, <b9_0>sleep/wake, body temperature, thirst, and appetite<b9_0/> are coordinately controlled by the <a3_0>biological clock<a3_0/>.[citation needed]"}
