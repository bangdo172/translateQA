In 1918, <a1_0>J.S. Szymanski<a1_0/> showed that <b6_0>animals are capable of maintaining 24-hour activity patterns in the absence of external cues<b6_0/> such as light and changes in temperature. In the early 20th century, <b7_0>circadian rhythms<b7_0/> were noticed in the rhythmic feeding times of <a2_0>bees<a2_0/>. Extensive experiments were done by Auguste Forel, Ingeborg Beling, and Oskar Wahl to see whether this rhythm was due to an endogenous clock.[citation needed] Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer isolated the <b8_0>first clock mutant in Drosophila<b8_0/> in the early 1970s and mapped the <a3_0>\"period\"<a3_0/> gene, the first discovered genetic determinant of behavioral rhythmicity. Joseph Takahashi discovered the first mammalian <a4_0>circadian clock<a4_0/> mutation (clock\u039419) using mice in 1994. However, recent studies show that deletion of clock does not lead to a behavioral phenotype (the animals still have normal circadian rhythms), which questions its importance in rhythm generation."}
