They thus enable organisms to best capitalize on <b6_0>environmental<b6_0/> <a1_0>resources<a1_0/> (e.g. light and food) compared to those that cannot predict such availability.

However, rhythmicity appears to be as important in <b8_0>regulating and coordinating <a3_0>internal metabolic<a3_0/> processes<b8_0/>, as in coordinating with the environment. This is suggested by the maintenance (heritability) of circadian rhythms in <a4_0>fruit flies<a4_0/> after several hundred generations in constant laboratory conditions, as well as in creatures in constant darkness in the wild, and by the experimental elimination of behavioral, but not physiological, circadian rhythms in quail."}
