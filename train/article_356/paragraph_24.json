The Red Shirts were instrumental in suppressing the black Republican vote in some areas in 1876 and narrowly electing <a4_0><b9_0>Wade Hampton<b9_0/><a4_0/> as governor, and taking back control of the state legislature. Another riot occurred in Charleston the day after the election, when a prominent Republican leader was mistakenly reported killed."}
