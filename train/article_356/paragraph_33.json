Jenkins<b6_0/><a1_0/> in Charleston. The orphanage accepted <a2_0><b7_0>donations of musical instruments<b7_0/><a2_0/> and Rev. Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and <a3_0><b8_0>Avery Institute Graduates<b8_0/><a3_0/> to tutor the boys in music. As a result, Charleston musicians became proficient on a variety of instruments and were able to read music expertly. These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. William \"Cat\" Anderson, Jabbo Smith, and Freddie Green are but a few of the alumni from the Jenkins Orphanage band who became professional musicians in some of the best bands of the day. Orphanages around the country began to develop brass bands in the wake of the Jenkins Orphanage Band's success. At the Colored Waif's Home Brass Band in <a4_0><b9_0>New Orleans<b9_0/><a4_0/>, for example, a young trumpeter named Louis Armstrong first began to draw attention."}
