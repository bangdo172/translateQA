The old city is located on a peninsula at the point where, as Charlestonians say, \"The Ashley and the Cooper Rivers come together to form the Atlantic Ocean.\" The entire peninsula is very low, some is landfill material, and as such, frequently floods during heavy rains, storm surges, and unusually high tides.
