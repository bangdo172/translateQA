Congress responded with a completely rewritten law, <b7_0>the Endangered Species Act of 1973<b7_0/> which was signed by Nixon on December 28, 1973 (Pub.L. 93\u2013205). It was written by a team of lawyers and scientists, including the first appointed head of <a1_0>the Council on Environmental Quality<a1_0/> (CEQ),an outgrowth of <b9_0>NEPA<b9_0/> (The \"National Environmental Policy Act of 1969\") <a0_0>Dr. Russell E.

Dr. Bertrand is credited with writing the most challenged section of the Act, the \"takings\" clause - Section <b8_0>2<b8_0/>."}
