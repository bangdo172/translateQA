Although the legislation prohibits interstate and foreign transactions for list species, <a1_0>no provisions are made for in-state commerce<a1_0/>, allowing these animals to be sold to roadside zoos and private collectors. Additionally, <a2_0>the ESA allows listed species to be shipped across state lines as long as they are not sold<a2_0/>. According to Green and the CPI, this allows dealers to \"donate\" listed species through supposed \"breeding loans\" to anyone, and <a3_0>in return they can legally receive a reciprocal monetary \"donation\" from the receiving party.<a3_0/> Furthermore, an interview with an endangered species specialist at <a4_0>the <b8_0>US Fish and Wildlife Service<b8_0/> revealed that the agency does not have sufficient staff to perform undercover investigations<a4_0/>, which would catch these false \"donations\" and other mislabeled transactions."}
