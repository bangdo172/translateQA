By <a2_0>1922<a2_0/> the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, <a3_0>one-fifth<a3_0/> of the world's population at the time, and covered more than <a4_0>13,000,000<a4_0/> sq mi (33,670,000 km2), almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \"the empire on which the sun never sets\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories."}
