A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of <a0_0>1773<a0_0/>, Pitt's India Act of <a1_0>1784<a1_0/> and the Charter Act of <a2_0>1813<a2_0/> which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired. The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the <a3_0>Government of India Act<a3_0/> 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and <a4_0>Queen Victoria<a4_0/> was crowned the Empress of India. India became the empire's most valuable possession, \"the Jewel in the Crown\", and was the most important source of Britain's strength."}
