The ensuing <a1_0>Crimean War<a1_0/> (1854\u201356), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, and was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica, was a resounding defeat for <a2_0>Russia<a2_0/>. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in <a3_0>1876<a3_0/> and <a4_0>Russia<a4_0/> annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente. The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u201305 also limited its threat to the British."}
