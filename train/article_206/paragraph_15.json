The Battle of Plassey in <a1_0>1757<a1_0/>, in which the British, led by <a2_0>Robert Clive<a2_0/>, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India.
