Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union 1800 after the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and had suffered a severe famine between 1845 and 1852. Home rule was supported by the British Prime minister, <a0_0>William Gladstone<a0_0/>, who hoped that Ireland might follow in <a1_0>Canada<a1_0/>'s footsteps as a Dominion within the empire, but his 1886 Home Rule bill was defeated in Parliament. Although the bill, if passed, would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation, many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break-up of the empire. A second Home Rule bill was also defeated for similar reasons. A third bill was passed by Parliament in <a3_0>1914<a3_0/>, but not implemented because of the outbreak of <a4_0>the First World War<a4_0/> leading to the <a2_0>1916<a2_0/> Easter Rising."}
