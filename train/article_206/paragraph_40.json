Concerns over communist and foreign plots following <a1_0>the Ghadar Conspiracy<a1_0/> ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts. This led to tension, particularly in the <a2_0>Punjab<a2_0/> region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the event, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion. The subsequent <a3_0>Non-Co-Operation<a3_0/> movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years."}
