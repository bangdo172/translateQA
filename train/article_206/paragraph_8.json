An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in <a0_0>1604<a0_0/> lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective <a4_0>to find gold deposits<a4_0/>. Colonies in St Lucia (<a1_0>1605<a1_0/>) and Grenada (1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in St. Kitts (1624), Barbados (1627) and Nevis (1628). The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil, which depended on slave labour, and\u2014at first\u2014Dutch ships, to sell the slaves and buy the sugar. To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces\u2014a series of Anglo-Dutch Wars\u2014which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch. In <a2_0>1655<a2_0/>, England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish, and in <a3_0>1666<a3_0/> succeeded in colonising the Bahamas."}
