Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large Afrikaner (or Boer) population in <a2_0>1806<a2_0/>, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands, following the invasion of the Netherlands by France. British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of <a3_0>Boers<a3_0/>, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own\u2014mostly short-lived\u2014independent republics, during the Great Trek of the late 1830s and early 1840s. In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and with several African polities, including those of the Sotho and the Zulu nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic (1852\u201377; 1881\u20131902) and the Orange Free State (1854\u20131902). In <a4_0>1902<a4_0/> Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two Boer Republics following the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902)."}
