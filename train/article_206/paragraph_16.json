In North America, France's future as a colonial power there was effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to Rupert's Land, and the ceding of New France to <a2_0>Britain<a2_0/> (leaving a sizeable French-speaking population under British control) and Louisiana to <a3_0>Spain<a3_0/>. Spain ceded Florida to <a4_0>Britain<a4_0/>. Along with its victory over France in India, the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's most powerful maritime power."}
