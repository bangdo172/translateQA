That year, Gilbert sailed for the West Indies with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America, but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic. In <a1_0>1583<a1_0/> he embarked on a second attempt, on this occasion to the island of <a2_0>Newfoundland<a2_0/> whose harbour he formally claimed for England, although no settlers were left behind. Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, <a3_0>Walter Raleigh<a3_0/>, who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584. Later that year, Raleigh founded the colony of <a4_0>Roanoke<a4_0/> on the coast of present-day North Carolina, but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail."}
