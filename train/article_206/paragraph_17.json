This was summarised at the time by the slogan <a1_0>\"No taxation without representation\"<a1_0/>, a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in <a2_0>1776<a2_0/>, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in <a3_0>1778<a3_0/> tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms. American independence was acknowledged at the Peace of Paris in <a4_0>1783<a4_0/>."}
