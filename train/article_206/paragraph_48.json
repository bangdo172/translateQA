The Malayan Emergency, as it was called, began in <a0_0>1948<a0_0/> and lasted until 1960, but by <a1_0>1957<a1_0/>, Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the Federation of Malaya within the Commonwealth. In 1963, the 11 states of the federation together with Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo joined to form Malaysia, but in <a2_0>1965<a2_0/> <a3_0>Chinese<a3_0/>-majority Singapore was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations. Brunei, which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union and maintained its status until independence in <a4_0>1984<a4_0/>."}
