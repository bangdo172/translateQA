Since then, they have suffered from strong competition from <a0_0><b4_0>specialist stores<b4_0/><a0_0/>. Most recently the competition has intensified with the advent of larger-scale <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0>superstores<b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/> (Jones et al. 1994; Merrilees and Miller 1997). Competition was not the only reason for the department stores' weakening strength; the changing structure of cities also affected them. The compact and centralized 19th century city with its mass transit lines converging on the downtown was a perfect environment for department store growth. But as <a2_0><b7_0>residents moved out of the downtown areas to the suburbs<b7_0/><a2_0/>, the large, downtown department stores became inconvenient and lost business to the newer suburban shopping malls. In <a3_0><b8_0>2003<b8_0/><a3_0/>, U.S. department store sales were surpassed by big-box store sales for the first time (though some stores may be classified as \"big box\" by physical layout and \"department store\" by merchandise)."}
