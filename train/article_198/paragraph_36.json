J. C. Penney had four stores in 1908, 312 in 1920, and <a0_0><b4_0><b5_0>1452<b5_0/><b4_0/><a0_0/> in 1930. Sears, Roebuck & Company, a giant mail-order house, opened its first eight retail stores in 1925, and operated 338 by 1930, and <a3_0><b8_0>595<b8_0/><a3_0/> by 1940. The chains reached a <a1_0><b6_0>middle-class audience<b6_0/><a1_0/>, that was more interested in value than in upscale fashions. <a2_0><b7_0>Sears<b7_0/><a2_0/> was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability, and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists \u2013 set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, \"windowless\" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns."}
