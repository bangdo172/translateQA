The company's innovative marketing promoted <a1_0><b6_0>the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity<b6_0/><a1_0/> and its techniques were adopted by modern department stores the world over. The store was extensively promoted through <a2_0><b7_0>paid advertising<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The shop floors were structured so that goods could be made more accessible to customers. There were elegant restaurants with modest prices, a library, reading and writing rooms, special reception rooms for French, German, American and \"Colonial\" customers, a First Aid Room, and a Silence Room, with soft lights, deep chairs, and double-glazing, all intended to keep customers in the store as long as possible. Staff members were taught to be on hand to assist customers, but not too aggressively, and to sell the merchandise. Selfridge attracted <a3_0><b8_0>shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits<b8_0/><a3_0/>; \u2013 in 1909, Louis Bl\u00e9riot's monoplane was exhibited at Selfridges (Bl\u00e9riot was the first to fly over the English Channel), and the first public demonstration of television by John Logie Baird took place in the department store in 1925."}
