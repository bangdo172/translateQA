He offered European retail merchandise at fixed prices on a variety of dry goods, and advertised a policy of providing <a1_0><b6_0>\"free entrance\" to all potential customers<b6_0/>.<a1_0/> Though it was clad in white marble to look like a Renaissance palazzo, the building's cast iron construction permitted large plate glass windows that permitted major seasonal displays, especially in the Christmas shopping season. In 1862, Stewart built a new store on a full city block with eight floors and <a2_0><b7_0>nineteen<b7_0/><a2_0/> departments of dress goods and furnishing materials, carpets, glass and china, toys and sports equipment, ranged around a central glass-covered court. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for <a3_0><b8_0>cash and not credit<b8_0/><a3_0/>, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, departmentalization, vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as <a4_0><b9_0>waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases<b9_0/><a4_0/>. His innovations were quickly copied by other department stores."}
