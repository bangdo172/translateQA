Today Myer and David Jones, located nationally, are practically the national department stores duopoly in Australia. When Russian-born migrant, Sidney Myer, came to Australia in <a1_0><b6_0>1899<b6_0/><a1_0/> he formed the Myer retail group with his brother, Elcon Myer. In 1900, they opened the first Myer department store, in <a2_0><b7_0>Bendigo, Victoria<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Since then, the Myer retail group has grown to be Australia's largest retailer. Both, Myer and David Jones, are <a3_0><b8_0>up-market chains<b8_0/><a3_0/>, offering a wide variety of products from mid-range names to luxury brands. Other retail chain stores such as Target (unrelated to the American chain of the same name), <a4_0><b9_0>Venture<b9_0/><a4_0/> (now defunct), Kmart and Big W, also located nationally, are considered to be Australia's discount department stores. Harris Scarfe, though only operating in four states and one territory, is a department store using both the large full-line and small discount department store formats. Most department stores in Australia have their own credit card companies, each having their own benefits while the discount department stores do not have their own credit card rights."}
