Marshall Field's Served as a model for other departments stores in that it had <a2_0><b7_0>exceptional customer service<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Field's also brought with it the now famous Frango mints brand that became so closely identified with Marshall Field's and Chicago from the now defunct Frederick & Nelson Department store.
