Therefore, Byzantine music remained <a1_0>monophonic<a1_0/> and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis), Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, this method which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic <a2_0>Byzantine chant<a2_0/>; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power."}
