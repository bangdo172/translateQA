By the beginning of the 15th century, the Ottoman advance meant that Byzantine territory in Greece was limited mainly to its then-largest city, <a1_0>Thessaloniki<a1_0/>, and the Peloponnese (Despotate of the Morea). After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Morea was the last remnant of the Byzantine Empire to hold out against <a2_0>the Ottomans<a2_0/>. However, this, too, fell to the Ottomans in <a3_0>1460<a3_0/>, completing the Ottoman conquest of mainland Greece. With the Turkish conquest, many <a4_0>Byzantine Greek scholars<a4_0/>, who up until then were largely responsible for preserving Classical Greek knowledge, fled to the West, taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly contributing to the Renaissance."}
