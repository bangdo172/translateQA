The New Testament was written in <a0_0>Greek<a0_0/>, and some of its sections (Corinthians, Thessalonians, Philippians, Revelation of St. John of Patmos) attest to the importance of churches in Greece in early Christianity. Nevertheless, much of Greece clung tenaciously to <a1_0>paganism<a1_0/>, and ancient Greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late 4th century AD, when they were outlawed by the Roman emperor <a3_0>Theodosius I<a3_0/> in 391-392. The last recorded Olympic games were held in <a2_0>393<a2_0/>, and many temples were destroyed or damaged in the century that followed. In Athens and rural areas, paganism is attested well into the sixth century AD and even later. The closure of the Neoplatonic Academy of Athens by the emperor <a4_0>Justinian<a4_0/> in 529 is considered by many to mark the end of antiquity, although there is evidence that the Academy continued its activities for some time after that. Some remote areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remained pagan until well into the 10th century AD."}
