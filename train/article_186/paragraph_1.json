Greece was first unified under <a0_0>Philip of Macedon<a0_0/> in the fourth century BC. His son <a1_0>Alexander the Great<a1_0/> rapidly conquered much of the ancient world, spreading Greek culture and science from the eastern Mediterranean to the Indus River. Annexed by <a2_0>Rome<a2_0/> in the second century BC, Greece became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire. The <a3_0>first century AD<a3_0/> saw the establishment of the Greek Orthodox Church, which shaped the modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox World. Falling under Ottoman dominion in the mid-15th century, the modern nation state of Greece emerged in <a4_0>1830<a4_0/> following the war of independence. Greece's rich historical legacy is reflected in large part by its 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, among the most in Europe and the world."}
