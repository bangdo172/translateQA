There is a special communications marking that signals that intelligence-related messages can be shared with these four countries. An indication of the United States' close operational cooperation is the creation of a new message distribution label within the main U.S. military communications network. Previously, the marking of NOFORN (i.e., <a1_0>No Foreign Nationals<a1_0/>) required the originator to specify which, if any, non-U.S. countries could receive the information. A new handling caveat, <a2_0>USA/AUS/CAN/GBR/NZL Five Eyes<a2_0/>, used primarily on intelligence messages, gives an easier way to indicate that the material can be shared with Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and New Zealand."}
