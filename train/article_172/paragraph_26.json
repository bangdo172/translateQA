Unlike its predecessor, the 1983 Code of Canon Law did not explicitly name Masonic orders among the secret societies it condemns. It states: \"A person who joins an association which plots against the Church is to be punished with a just penalty; one who promotes or takes office in such an association is to be punished with an interdict.\" This named omission of Masonic orders caused both Catholics and Freemasons to believe that the ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons may have been lifted, especially after the perceived liberalisation of Vatican II. However, the matter was clarified when <a1_0><b4_0>Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger<b4_0/><a1_0/> (later Pope Benedict XVI), as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a Declaration on Masonic Associations, which states: \"... <b5_0>the Church's negative judgment in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged<b5_0/> since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden. The faithful who enroll in Masonic associations are in a state of grave sin and may not receive Holy Communion.\" For its part, <a2_0>Freemasonry has never objected to Catholics joining their fraternity<a2_0/>. Those <b6_0>Grand Lodges<b6_0/> in amity with UGLE deny the Church's claims. The UGLE now states that \"Freemasonry does not seek to replace a Mason's religion or provide a substitute for it.\""}
