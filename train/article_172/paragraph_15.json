In <a1_0><a6_0><b11_0>1775<b11_0/><a6_0/><a1_0/>, an African-American named Prince Hall, along with fourteen other African-Americans, was initiated into a British military lodge with a warrant from the Grand Lodge of Ireland, having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in Boston. When the military Lodge left North America, those fifteen men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In <a7_0>1784<a7_0/>, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Premier Grand Lodge of England (GLE) and formed African Lodge, Number 459. When the UGLE was formed in <a8_0>1813<a8_0/>, all <a2_0><b12_0>U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls<b12_0/><a2_0/> \u2013 due largely to the War of 1812. Thus, separated from both UGLE and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge re-titled itself as <a9_0>the <a3_0>African Lodge, Number 1<a9_0/><a3_0/> \u2013 and <a4_0><b13_0>became a de facto \"Grand Lodge\"<b13_0/><a4_0/> (this Lodge is not to be confused with the various Grand Lodges on the Continent of Africa). As with the rest of U.S. Freemasonry, Prince Hall Freemasonry soon grew and organised on a Grand Lodge system for each state."}
