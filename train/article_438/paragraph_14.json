Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds. Pairs of Sight hounds (or long-dogs), such as greyhounds, may be used <a9_0>to pursue<a9_0/> a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers. Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags (deer) or mink. <a8_0>Deer stalking<a8_0/> with rifles is carried out <a4_0>on foot without hounds, using stealth<a4_0/>."}
