Even figures considered godly are described to have engaged in <a6_0>hunting<a6_0/>. One of the names of the god Shiva is <a1_0>Mrigavyadha<a1_0/>, which translates as <a2_0>\"the <a7_0>deer hunter<a7_0/>\"<a2_0/> (mriga means deer; vyadha means hunter). The word Mriga, in many Indian languages including Malayalam, not only stands for deer, but for all animals and animal instincts (Mriga Thrishna). Shiva, as Mrigavyadha, is the one who destroys the <a3_0><b11_0>animal instincts<b11_0/><a3_0/> in <a8_0>human beings<a8_0/>. In the epic Ramayana, Dasharatha, the father of Rama, is said to have the ability to <a4_0>hunt <b12_0>in the dark<b12_0/><a4_0/>. During one of his hunting expeditions, he accidentally killed <b13_0>Shravana<b13_0/>, mistaking him for game. During Rama's exile in <b14_0>the forest<b14_0/>, Ravana kidnapped his wife, Sita, from their hut, while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer, and his brother Lakshman went after him. According to the Mahabharat, Pandu, the father of the Pandavas, accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow, mistaking them for a deer.
