Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of <a5_0>hounds<a5_0/>, with the illegal use of trap guns, trap cages and snare nets. With approximately <a1_0>12,000<a1_0/> sport hunters applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very <a3_0>high<a3_0/>. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for <a2_0><b8_0>poached wild game<b8_0/><a2_0/> (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be <b9_0>fairly high<b9_0/>. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as of 2013). It appears that the <a6_0>red brocket deer<a6_0/> population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad piping guans and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal hunters pay <a7_0>very small fees<a7_0/> to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or <b10_0>hunting-ethics training<b10_0/>. There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority is <b11_0>under-staffed and under-funded<b11_0/>, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting <b12_0>occurring both in and out of season<b12_0/>, and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management."}
