As cockroaches move very quickly, they need to be video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More <a0_0>sedate<a0_0/> locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (<a1_0>Phasmatodea<a1_0/>). A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the <a2_0>water<a2_0/>, especially members of the <a4_0>Gerridae<a4_0/> family, commonly known as <a3_0>water striders<a3_0/>. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species."}
