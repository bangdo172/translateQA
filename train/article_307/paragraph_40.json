A <a3_0>semiochemical<a3_0/> is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of <a4_0>semiochemicals<a4_0/> include pheromones and kairomones. One example is the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation."}
