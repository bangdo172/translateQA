Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and <a1_0>diffusive ventilation<a1_0/>, to discontinuous gas exchange.:65\u201368 During <a2_0>continuous gas exchange<a2_0/>, oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle. In <a3_0>discontinuous gas exchange<a3_0/>, however, the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest. Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by <a4_0>diffusion<a4_0/> rather than physically taking in the oxygen. Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration. As larvae, many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water, while others need to rise to the water surface to replenish air supplies which may be held or trapped in special structures."}
