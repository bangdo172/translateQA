The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg with a number of live <a3_0>caterpillars<a3_0/> on which the young feed when hatched. Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four caterpillars per cell. The number of caterpillars is different among species, but always the same for each sex of larva. The male solitary wasp in the genus Eumenes is <a4_0>smaller<a4_0/> than the female, so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her cell."}
