Many species have <a2_0>acute<a2_0/> vision capable of detecting <a3_0>minute<a3_0/> movements. The eyes may include simple eyes or ocelli as well as compound eyes of varying sizes. Many species are able to detect light in the <a4_0>infrared<a4_0/>, ultraviolet and the visible light wavelengths. Color vision has been demonstrated in many species and phylogenetic analysis suggests that UV-green-blue trichromacy existed from at least the Devonian period between 416 and 359 million years ago."}
