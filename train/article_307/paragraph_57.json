For example, because of its small size, short generation time and high fecundity, the common <a1_0>fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster<a1_0/> is a model organism for studies in the genetics of higher eukaryotes. D. melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like <a2_0>genetic<a2_0/> linkage, interactions between genes, chromosomal genetics, development, behavior and evolution. Because genetic systems are well conserved among <a3_0>eukaryotes<a3_0/>, understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies can help to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans. The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000, reflecting the organism's important role in biological research. It was found that <a4_0>70%<a4_0/> of the fly genome is similar to the human genome, supporting the evolution theory."}
