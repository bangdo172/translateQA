They obtain their toxicity by <a2_0>sequestering<a2_0/> the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some <a3_0>Lepidoptera<a3_0/> manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of M\u00fcllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray <a4_0>chemicals<a4_0/> from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators."}
