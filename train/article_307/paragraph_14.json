Of all the insect orders, <a2_0>Orthoptera<a2_0/> displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the <a3_0>apex<a3_0/> (dorsal region), is situated between the <a4_0>compound<a4_0/> eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90\u00b0 to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.:13"}
