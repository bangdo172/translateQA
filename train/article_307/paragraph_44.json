Most insects, however, lead <a3_0>short<a3_0/> lives as adults, and rarely interact with one another except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of parental care, where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the <a4_0>growing offspring<a4_0/>, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps."}
