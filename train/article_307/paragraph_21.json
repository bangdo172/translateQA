The <a1_0>salivary ducts<a1_0/> lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the <a2_0>salivarium<a2_0/>, located <a3_0>behind the hypopharynx<a3_0/>. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down. Some insects, like flies, have extra-oral digestion. Insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down. This strategy allows insects to extract a significant proportion of the available nutrients from the food source.:31 <a4_0>The gut<a4_0/> is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the foregut, midgut and hindgut."}
