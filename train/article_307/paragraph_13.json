The segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but <a3_0>interconnected<a3_0/> units, or <a4_0>tagmata<a4_0/>: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs\u2014one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax\u2014and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures.:22\u201348 Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts."}
