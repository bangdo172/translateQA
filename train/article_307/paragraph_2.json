As it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a <a0_0><a8_0>tripedal<a0_0/> gait<a8_0/> in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating <a7_0>triangles<a7_0/>. Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight. Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water, with larval adaptations that include <a1_0>gills<a1_0/>, and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming. Some species, such as <a2_0>water striders<a2_0/>, are capable of walking on the surface of water. Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain bees, ants and termites, are social and live in large, well-organized colonies. Some insects, such as earwigs, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young. Insects can <a9_0>communicate<a9_0/> with each other in a variety of ways. Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances. Other species communicate with sounds: crickets <a3_0>stridulate<a3_0/>, or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males. <a4_0>Lampyridae<a4_0/> in the beetle order Coleoptera communicate with light."}
