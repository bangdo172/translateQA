Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into <a0_0>paddle-like<a0_0/> structures. Dragonfly naiads use <a1_0>jet<a1_0/> propulsion, forcibly expelling water out of their <a2_0>rectal chamber<a2_0/>. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking on the surface of water. They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but <a3_0>recessed<a3_0/> in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit <a4_0>pygidial<a4_0/> gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen)."}
