Some insects perform complex ecological roles; <a3_0>blow-flies<a3_0/>, for example, help consume carrion but also spread diseases. Insect pollinators are essential to the life-cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the <a1_0>terrestrial<a1_0/> portion of the biosphere (including humans) would be devastated.
