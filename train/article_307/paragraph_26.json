Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of <a1_0>internal tubes<a1_0/> and sacs through which <a2_0>gases<a2_0/> either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering <a3_0>oxygen<a3_0/> directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the <a4_0>circulatory system<a4_0/> is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity.:61\u201365 Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles."}
