These low sounds are simply the sounds made by the insect's <a1_0>movement<a1_0/>. Through <a2_0>microscopic stridulatory structures<a2_0/> located on the insect's muscles and joints, the normal sounds of the insect moving are amplified and can be used to warn or <a3_0>communicate<a3_0/> with other insects. Most sound-making insects also have tympanal organs that can perceive airborne sounds. Some species in Hemiptera, such as the corixids (water boatmen), are known to communicate via <a4_0>underwater<a4_0/> sounds. Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted through surfaces."}
