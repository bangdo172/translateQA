A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear a striking resemblance to <a2_0>wasps<a2_0/>, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and M\u00fcllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found <a3_0>in Lepidoptera<a3_0/>. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine Viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine Monarch. Later research has discovered that the Viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the Monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of M\u00fcllerian mimicry. In M\u00fcllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. <a4_0>Taxa<a4_0/> from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known M\u00fcllerian complexes."}
