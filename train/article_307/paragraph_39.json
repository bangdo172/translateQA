Vibrations can also be used to communicate between entirely <a1_0>different species<a1_0/>; lycaenid (<a3_0>gossamer-winged butterfly<a3_0/>) caterpillars which are <a4_0>myrmecophilous<a4_0/> (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way. The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression; the Death's-head Hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity."}
