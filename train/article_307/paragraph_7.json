Many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators. Such insects often advertise their toxicity using <a9_0>warning <a3_0>colors<a9_0/><a3_0/>. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics. Over time, this has led to complex groups of coevolved species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like <a4_0>pollination<a4_0/>, are beneficial to both organisms. Coevolution has led to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems."}
