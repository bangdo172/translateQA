Since it is impossible to entirely eliminate pest insects from the human food chain, insects are inadvertently present in many foods, especially grains.

According to cultural materialist anthropologist Marvin Harris, the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other protein sources such as fish or livestock."}
