The rectum absorbs <a3_0>90%<a3_0/> of the water in these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through <a4_0>the anus<a4_0/> (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.:71\u201372, 78\u201380"}
