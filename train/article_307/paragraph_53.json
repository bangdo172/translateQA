Most flowering plants require <a1_0>an animal<a1_0/> to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by <a2_0>insects<a2_0/>. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of <a3_0>energy rich nectar<a3_0/> it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as <a4_0>pollination syndromes<a4_0/>. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology."}
