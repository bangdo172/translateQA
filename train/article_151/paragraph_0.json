It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the <a1_0>pituitary<a1_0/> gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The <a2_0>testes<a2_0/> primarily release testosterone, and the <a3_0>ovaries<a3_0/> predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop <a4_0>gynecomastia<a4_0/> due to an imbalance of sex hormones, tissue responsiveness or obesity."}
