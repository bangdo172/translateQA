While cultural variation exists for legal rights and their corresponding ages, considerable consistency is found across cultures. Furthermore, since the advent of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in <a0_0>1989<a0_0/> (children here defined as under 18), almost every country in the world (except the <a1_0>U.S. and South Sudan<a1_0/>) has legally committed to advancing an anti-discriminatory stance towards young people of all ages. This includes protecting children against unchecked child labor, enrollment in the military, prostitution, and pornography. In many societies, those who reach a certain age (often 18, though this varies) are considered to have reached the age of majority and are legally <a3_0>regarded as adults who are responsible for their actions<a3_0/>. People below this age are considered minors or children. A person below the age of majority may gain adult rights through <a2_0>legal emancipation<a2_0/>."}
