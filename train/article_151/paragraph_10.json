For females, it is menarche, the onset of <a2_0>menstruation<a2_0/>, which occurs, on average, between ages 12 and 13. The age of menarche is influenced by heredity, but a girl's <a3_0>diet and lifestyle<a3_0/> contribute as well. Regardless of genes, a girl must have a certain proportion of body fat to attain menarche. Consequently, girls who have a high-fat diet and who are not physically active begin menstruating earlier, on average, than girls whose diet contains less fat and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise (e.g. ballet and gymnastics). Girls who experience malnutrition or are in societies in which children are expected to perform physical labor also begin menstruating at <a4_0>later<a4_0/> ages."}
