This process is <a0_0>different<a0_0/> for females and males. Before puberty, there are nearly no sex differences in fat and muscle distribution; during puberty, <a1_0>boys<a1_0/> grow muscle much faster than girls, although both sexes experience rapid muscle development. In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for <a2_0>girls<a2_0/>. Frequently, the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around <a3_0>three to one<a3_0/>, while for girls it is about <a4_0>five to four<a4_0/>. This may help explain sex differences in athletic performance."}
