One is the <a0_0>constructivist<a0_0/> view of cognitive development. Based on the work of Piaget, it takes a <a2_0>quantitative, state-theory<a2_0/> approach, hypothesizing that adolescents' cognitive improvement is relatively <a1_0>sudden and drastic<a1_0/>. The second is the information-processing perspective, which derives from the study of <a3_0>artificial intelligence<a3_0/> and attempts to explain cognitive development in terms of the growth of specific components of the thinking process."}
