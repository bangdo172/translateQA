While adolescents may engage in casual sexual encounters (often referred to as <a0_0>hookups<a0_0/>), most sexual experience during this period of development takes place <a1_0>within<a1_0/> romantic relationships. Adolescents can use technologies and <a2_0>social media<a2_0/> to seek out romantic relationships as they feel it is a safe place to try out dating and identity exploration. From these social media encounters, a further relationship may begin. Kissing, hand holding, and hugging signify satisfaction and commitment. Among young adolescents, \"heavy\" sexual activity, marked by <a3_0>genital stimulation<a3_0/>, is often associated with violence, depression, and poor relationship quality. This effect does not hold true for sexual activity in late adolescence that takes place within a romantic relationship. Some research suggest that there are genetic causes of early sexual activity that are also risk factors for delinquency, suggesting that there is a group who are at risk for both early sexual activity and emotional distress. For old adolescents, though, sexual activity in the context of romantic relationships was actually correlated with <a4_0>lower<a4_0/> levels of deviant behavior after controlling for genetic risks, as opposed to sex outside of a relationship (hook-ups)"}
