Most teens said they had kissed their partners, held hands with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than <a2_0>romantic<a2_0/> events (holding hands) and <a0_0>social events<a0_0/> (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results <a1_0>focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents<a1_0/> and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences."}
