The first stage, known as <a1_0>sensitization<a1_0/>, usually starts in <a2_0>childhood<a2_0/>, and is marked by the child's becoming aware of same-sex attractions. The second stage, <a3_0><a4_0>identity confusion<a4_0/><a3_0/>, tends to occur a few years later. In this stage, the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation, and begins to engage sexual experiences with same-sex partners. In the third stage of identity assumption, which usually takes place a few years after the adolescent has left home, adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends, and assumes a self-definition as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. In the final stage, known as commitment, the young adult adopts their sexual identity as a lifestyle. Therefore, this model estimates that the process of coming out begins in childhood, and continues through the early to mid 20s. This model has been contested, and alternate ideas have been explored in recent years."}
