Development in the <a3_0>limbic<a3_0/> system plays an important role in determining rewards and punishments and processing emotional experience and social information. Changes in the levels of the neurotransmitters <a4_0>dopamine and serotonin<a4_0/> in the limbic system make adolescents more emotional and more responsive to rewards and stress. The corresponding increase in emotional variability also can increase adolescents' vulnerability. The effect of serotonin is <a1_0>not<a1_0/> limited to the limbic system: Several serotonin receptors have their gene expression change dramatically during adolescence, particularly in the human frontal and prefrontal cortex ."}
