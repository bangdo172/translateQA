Culture has been defined as the \"<a0_0>symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a community framework for what is valued<a0_0/>\". Culture is learned and socially shared, and it affects <a1_0>all<a1_0/> aspects of an individual's life. Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and belief system development, for instance, are all things that are likely to vary by culture. Furthermore, distinguishing characteristics of youth, including dress, music and other uses of media, employment, art, food and beverage choices, recreation, and language, all constitute a youth culture. For these reasons, culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture. However, \"culture\" should <a3_0>not<a3_0/> be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity. Many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group. Furthermore, to avoid ethnocentrism, researchers must be careful <a2_0>not to define the culture's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs<a2_0/>."}
