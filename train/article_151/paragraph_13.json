At the time that the penis develops, the <a4_0>seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the bulbourethral gland<a4_0/> also enlarge and develop. The first ejaculation of seminal fluid generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth, although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically, since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of <a0_0>masturbation<a0_0/>. Boys are generally fertile before they have an adult appearance."}
