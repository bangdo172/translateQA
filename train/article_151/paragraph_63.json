Through a process called <a2_0>synaptic pruning<a2_0/>, unnecessary neuronal connections in the brain are eliminated and the amount of grey matter is pared down. However, this does not mean that the brain loses functionality; rather, it becomes <a3_0>more efficient<a3_0/> due to increased myelination (insulation of axons) and the reduction of unused pathways."}
