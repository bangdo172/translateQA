This allows the individual to think and reason in a wider perspective. A combination of behavioural and fMRI studies have demonstrated development of <a1_0>executive functions<a1_0/>, that is, cognitive skills that enable the control and coordination of thoughts and behaviour, which are generally associated with the <a2_0>prefrontal cortex<a2_0/>. The thoughts, ideas and concepts developed at this period of life greatly influence one's future life, playing a major role in character and personality formation."}
