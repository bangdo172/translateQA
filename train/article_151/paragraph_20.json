This questionnaire has been used to gauge <a2_0>differences in cultural perceptions of adolescent autonomy<a2_0/>, finding, for instance, that <a1_0>White<a1_0/> parents and adolescents tend to expect autonomy earlier than those of Asian descent. It is, therefore, clear that cultural differences exist in perceptions of adolescent autonomy, and such differences have implications for the lifestyles and development of adolescents. In sub-Saharan African youth, the notions of individuality and freedom may not be useful in understanding adolescent development. Rather, African notions of childhood and adolescent development are relational and interdependent."}
