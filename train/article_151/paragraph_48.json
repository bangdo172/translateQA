Through experience outside the family circle, they learn that rules they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic. They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of <a2_0>common sense<a2_0/>\u2014not touching a hot stove\u2014and those that are based on <a1_0>culturally-relative<a1_0/> standards (codes of etiquette, not dating until a certain age), a delineation that younger children do not make. This can lead to a period of questioning authority in all domains."}
