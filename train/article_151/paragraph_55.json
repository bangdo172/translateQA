Psychologists have identified three main types of autonomy: <a0_0>emotional independence, behavioral autonomy, and cognitive autonomy<a0_0/>. Emotional autonomy is defined in terms of an adolescent's relationships with others, and often includes the development of more mature emotional connections with adults and peers. <a2_0>Behavioral<a2_0/> autonomy <a1_0>encompasses an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern<a1_0/>. Cultural differences are especially visible in this category because it concerns issues of dating, social time with peers, and time-management decisions. Cognitive autonomy describes <a3_0>the capacity for an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation<a3_0/>. Converging influences from adolescent cognitive development, expanding social relationships, an increasingly adultlike appearance, and the acceptance of more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of autonomy for adolescents. Proper development of autonomy has been tied to good mental health, high self-esteem, self-motivated tendencies, positive self-concepts, and self-initiating and regulating behaviors. Furthermore, it has been found that adolescents' mental health is best when their feelings about autonomy <a4_0>match closely<a4_0/> with those of their parents."}
