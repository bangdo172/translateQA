Exploring these possibilities may result in abrupt changes in self-presentation as the adolescent chooses or rejects qualities and behaviors, trying to guide the actual self toward the <a2_0>ideal<a2_0/> self (<a0_0>who the adolescent wishes to be<a0_0/>) and away from the feared self (<a1_0>who the adolescent does not want to be<a1_0/>). For many, these distinctions are uncomfortable, but they also appear to motivate achievement through behavior consistent with the ideal and distinct from the feared possible selves."}
