Males experience their growth spurt about <a1_0>two years later<a1_0/>, on average, than <a0_0>females<a0_0/>. During their peak height velocity (the time of most rapid growth), adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a <a4_0>toddler<a4_0/>\u2014about <a2_0>4 inches (10.3 cm) a year<a2_0/> for males and <a3_0>3.5 inches (9 cm)<a3_0/> for females. In addition to changes in height, adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight (Marshall, 1978). The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one's adult body weight. Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty."}
