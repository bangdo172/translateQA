During early adolescence, adolescents often associate in cliques, <a1_0>exclusive, single-sex groups of peers with whom they are particularly close<a1_0/>. Despite the common notion that cliques are an inherently negative influence, they may <a2_0>help adolescents become socially acclimated and form a stronger sense of identity<a2_0/>. Within a clique of highly athletic male-peers, for example, the clique may create a stronger sense of fidelity and competition. Cliques also have become somewhat a \"collective parent,\" i.e. telling the adolescents what to do and not to do. Towards late adolescence, cliques often merge into mixed-sex groups as teenagers begin romantically engaging with one another. These small friend groups then break down further as socialization becomes more couple-oriented. On a larger scale, adolescents often associate with crowds, groups of individuals who share a common interest or activity. Often, crowd identities may be the basis for stereotyping young people, such as jocks or nerds. In large, multi-ethnic high schools, there are often ethnically-determined crowds. While crowds are very influential during early and middle adolescence, they lose salience during high school as students identify more individually."}
