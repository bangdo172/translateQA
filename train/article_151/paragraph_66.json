In addressing this question, it is important to distinguish whether adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors (prevalence), whether they make risk-related decisions similarly or differently than adults (cognitive processing perspective), or whether they use the same processes but value different things and thus arrive at different conclusions. The <a3_0>behavioral decision-making theory<a3_0/> proposes that adolescents and adults <a2_0>both<a2_0/> weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action. However, research has shown that <a1_0>adolescents<a1_0/> seem to give more weight to rewards, particularly social rewards, than do adults."}
