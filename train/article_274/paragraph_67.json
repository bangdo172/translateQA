It has been making ends meet on a month-to-month basis with the help of bond money held in a state escrow account and has instituted mandatory unpaid days off for many city workers. Those troubles, along with underfunded city services, such as police and fire departments, and ineffective turnaround plans from Bing and the City Council led the state of Michigan to appoint an emergency manager for Detroit on March 14, 2013. On June 14, 2013 Detroit defaulted on $2.5 billion of debt by withholding $39.7 million in interest payments, while Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr met with bondholders and other creditors in an attempt to restructure the city's $18.5 billion debt and avoid bankruptcy. On <a3_0>July 18, 2013<a3_0/>, the City of Detroit filed for <a2_0>Chapter 9<a2_0/> bankruptcy protection. It was declared bankrupt by U.S. judge <a1_0>Stephen Rhodes<a1_0/> on December 3, with its <a4_0>$18.5 billion<a4_0/> debt he said in accepting the city's contention that it is broke and that negotiations with its thousands of creditors were infeasible."}
