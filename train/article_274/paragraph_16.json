After taking office, Young emphasized increasing racial diversity in the police department. Young also worked to improve Detroit's transportation system, but tension between Young and his suburban counterparts over regional matters was problematic throughout his mayoral term. In 1976, the federal government offered <a2_0>$600 million<a2_0/> for building a regional rapid transit system, under a single regional authority. But the inability of Detroit and its <a3_0>suburban neighbors<a3_0/> to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit. Following the failure to reach an agreement over the larger system, the City moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator portion of the system, which became known as the <a1_0>Detroit People Mover<a1_0/>."}
