The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called <a1_0>refinancing facilities<a1_0/>. In these facilities, bonds are not purchased but used in reverse transactions: <a2_0><b5_0>repurchase agreements, or collateralised loans<b5_0/><a2_0/>. These two transactions are similar, i.e. bonds are used as collaterals for loans, the difference being of legal nature.
