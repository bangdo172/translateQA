Loans totalling \u20ac489.2 bn (US$640 bn) were announced. The loans were not offered to European states, but government securities issued by European states would be acceptable collateral as would mortgage-backed securities and other commercial paper that can be demonstrated to be secure. The programme was announced on 8 December 2011 but observers were surprised by the volume of the loans made when it was implemented. Under its LTRO it loaned \u20ac489bn to 523 banks for an exceptionally long period of three years at a rate of just one percent. The by far biggest amount of \u20ac325bn was tapped by banks in <a0_0><b4_0>Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain<b4_0/><a0_0/>.
