They also have <a1_0><b6_0>parapodia<b6_0/><a1_0/> for locomotion. Most textbooks still use the traditional division into <a2_0><b7_0>polychaetes<b7_0/><a2_0/> (almost all marine), <a3_0><b9_0>oligochaetes<b9_0/><a3_0/> (which include earthworms) and leech-like species. Cladistic research since 1997 has radically changed this scheme, viewing leeches as a sub-group of <a4_0>oligochaetes<a4_0/> and <b8_0>oligochaetes<b8_0/> as a sub-group of polychaetes. In addition, the Pogonophora, Echiura and Sipuncula, previously regarded as separate phyla, are now regarded as sub-groups of polychaetes. Annelids are considered members of the Lophotrochozoa, a \"super-phylum\" of protostomes that also includes molluscs, brachiopods, flatworms and nemerteans."}
