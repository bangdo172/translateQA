Vertebrates have a different system, in which one neuron controls a group of muscle fibers. Most <b6_0>annelids<b6_0/>' longitudinal nerve trunks include giant axons (<a1_0><b4_0>the output signal lines of nerve cells<b4_0/><a1_0/>). Their large diameter decreases their resistance, which allows them to transmit signals exceptionally fast. This enables these worms to withdraw rapidly from danger by <a2_0><b5_0>shortening their bodies<b5_0/><a2_0/>. Experiments have shown that cutting the giant axons prevents this escape response but does not affect normal movement."}
