Many polychaetes have a muscular <a1_0><b5_0>pharynx<b5_0/><a1_0/> that can be everted (<a0_0>turned inside out to extend<a0_0/> it). In these animals the foremost few segments often lack septa so that, when the muscles in these segments contract, the sharp increase in fluid pressure from all these segments everts the pharynx very quickly. Two families, the <a2_0><b6_0>Eunicidae and Phyllodocidae<b6_0/><a2_0/>, have evolved jaws, which can be used for <a3_0><b7_0>seizing prey, biting off pieces of vegetation, or grasping dead and decaying matter<b7_0/><a3_0/>. On the other hand, some predatory polychaetes have neither jaws nor eversible pharynges. Selective deposit feeders generally live in tubes on the sea-floor and use palps to find food particles in the sediment and then wipe them into their mouths. Filter feeders use \"crowns\" of <a4_0><b8_0>palps covered in cilia<b8_0/><a4_0/> that wash food particles towards their mouths. Non-selective deposit feeders ingest soil or marine sediments via mouths that are generally unspecialized. Some clitellates have sticky pads in the roofs of their mouths, and some of these can evert the pads to capture prey. Leeches often have an eversible proboscis, or a muscular pharynx with two or three teeth."}
