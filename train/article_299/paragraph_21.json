About <a1_0><b5_0>14%<b5_0/><a1_0/> use a similar external fertilization but produce yolk-rich eggs, which <a2_0><b6_0>reduce the time the larva needs to spend among the plankton<b6_0/><a2_0/>, or eggs from which miniature adults emerge rather than larvae. The rest care for the fertilized eggs until they hatch \u2013 some by producing <a3_0><b7_0>jelly<b7_0/><a3_0/>-covered masses of eggs which they tend, some by attaching the eggs to their bodies and a few species by keeping the eggs within their bodies until they hatch. These species use a variety of methods for sperm transfer; for example, in some the females collect sperm released into the water, while in others the males have a penis that inject sperm into the female. There is no guarantee that this is a representative sample of polychaetes' reproductive patterns, and it simply reflects scientists' current knowledge."}
