In leeches there are no septa, the <a1_0><b6_0>connective tissue layer of the body wall<b6_0/><a1_0/> is so thick that it occupies much of the body, and the <a2_0><b7_0>two<b7_0/><a2_0/> coelomata are widely separated and run the length of the body. They function as the main blood vessels, although they are side-by-side rather than upper and lower. However, they are lined with <a3_0><b8_0>mesothelium<b8_0/><a3_0/>, like the coelomata and unlike the blood vessels of other annelids. Leeches generally use <a4_0><b9_0>suckers at their front and rear ends<b9_0/><a4_0/> to move like inchworms. The anus is on the upper surface of the pygidium."}
