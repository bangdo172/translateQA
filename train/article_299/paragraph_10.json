The brains of polychaetes are generally <a4_0><b7_0>in the prostomium<b7_0/><a4_0/>, while those of clitellates are <a3_0><b6_0>in the peristomium or sometimes the first segment behind the peristomium<b6_0/><a3_0/>. In some very mobile and active polychaetes the brain is enlarged and more complex, with visible hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain sections. The rest of <b8_0>the central nervous system<b8_0/> is generally \"ladder-like\", consisting of a pair of nerve cords that run through the bottom part of the body and have in each segment paired ganglia linked by a transverse connection. From each segmental ganglion a branching system of local nerves runs into the body wall and then encircles the body. However, in most polychaetes <b9_0>the two main nerve cords<b9_0/> are fused, and in the tube-dwelling genus Owenia the single nerve chord has no ganglia and is located in the epidermis."}
