When their cells divide <a1_0><b4_0>after the 4-cell stage, descendants of these 4 cells form a spiral pattern<b4_0/><a1_0/>. In these phyla the \"fates\" of the embryo's cells, in other words the roles their descendants will play in the adult animal, are the same and can be predicted from a very early stage. Hence this development pattern is often described as \"<a2_0><b5_0>spiral determinate cleavage<b5_0/><a2_0/>\"."}
