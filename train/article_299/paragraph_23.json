All have well-developed gonads, and all copulate. Earthworms store their partners' sperm in spermathecae (\"sperm stores\") and then the clitellum produces a cocoon that collects ova from <b7_0>the ovaries<b7_0/> and then sperm from the spermathecae. Fertilization and development of earthworm eggs takes place in the cocoon. Leeches' eggs are fertilized <a2_0>in the ovaries<a2_0/>, and then transferred to <a3_0>the cocoon<a3_0/>.
