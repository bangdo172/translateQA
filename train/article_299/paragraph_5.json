Their bodies are long, with segments that are divided externally by <a0_0><b5_0>shallow ring-like constrictions called annuli<b5_0/><a0_0/> and internally by <a1_0><b6_0>septa (\"partitions\")<b6_0/><a1_0/> at the same points, although in some species the septa are incomplete and in a few cases missing. Most of the segments contain the same sets of organs, although sharing <a2_0><b7_0>a common gut, circulatory system and nervous system<b7_0/><a2_0/> makes them inter-dependent. Their bodies are covered by <a3_0><b8_0>a cuticle<b8_0/><a3_0/> (outer covering) that does not contain cells but is secreted by cells in the skin underneath, is made of tough but flexible <a4_0><b9_0>collagen<b9_0/><a4_0/> and does not molt \u2013 on the other hand arthropods' cuticles are made of the more rigid \u03b1-chitin, and molt until the arthropods reach their full size. Most annelids have closed circulatory systems, where the blood makes its entire circuit via blood vessels."}
