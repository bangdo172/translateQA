The simplest are unjointed and form paired bundles near the top and bottom of each side of each segment. The parapodia (\"<b3_0>limbs<b3_0/>\") of annelids that have them often bear more complex chetae at their tips \u2013 for example jointed, comb-like or hooked. Chetae are made of moderately flexible \u03b2-chitin and are formed by follicles, each of which has a chetoblast (\"<a0_0><b4_0>hair-forming<b4_0/><a0_0/>\") cell at the bottom and muscles that can extend or retract the cheta. The chetoblasts produce chetae by forming <a1_0><b5_0>microvilli<b5_0/><a1_0/>, fine hair-like extensions that increase the area available for secreting the cheta. When the cheta is complete, the microvilli withdraw into the chetoblast, leaving parallel tunnels that run almost the full length of the cheta. Hence annelids' chetae are structurally different from the setae (\"<a2_0><b6_0>bristles<b6_0/><a2_0/>\") of arthropods, which are made of the more rigid \u03b1-chitin, have a single internal cavity, and are mounted on flexible joints in shallow pits in the cuticle."}
