For a cross-check the study used an analysis of <a2_0><b7_0>11<b7_0/><a2_0/> genes (including the original 3) in 10 taxa. This analysis agreed that clitellates, pogonophorans and echiurans were on various branches of the polychaete family tree. It also concluded that the classification of polychaetes into <a3_0><b8_0>Scolecida, Canalipalpata and Aciculata<b8_0/><a3_0/> was useless, as the members of these alleged groups were scattered all over the family tree derived from comparing the 81 taxa. In addition, it also placed sipunculans, generally regarded at the time as a separate phylum, on another branch of the polychaete tree, and concluded that leeches were a sub-group of <a4_0><b9_0>oligochaetes<b9_0/><a4_0/> rather than their sister-group among the clitellates. Rouse accepted the analyses based on molecular phylogenetics, and their main conclusions are now the scientific consensus, although the details of the annelid family tree remain uncertain."}
