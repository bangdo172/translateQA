In the <a0_0><b3_0>glaciated areas of North America<b3_0/><a0_0/>, for example, almost all native earthworms are thought to have been killed by the glaciers and the worms currently found in those areas are all introduced from other areas, primarily from <a1_0><b4_0>Europe<b4_0/><a1_0/>, and, more recently, from Asia. <a2_0><b5_0>Northern hardwood forests<b5_0/><a2_0/> are especially negatively impacted by invasive worms through the loss of leaf duff, soil fertility, changes in soil chemistry and the loss of ecological diversity. Especially of concern is Amynthas agrestis and at least one state (Wisconsin) has listed it as a prohibited species."}
