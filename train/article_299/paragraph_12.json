Nuchal (\"<a1_0>on the neck<a1_0/>\") organs are paired, ciliated structures found only in <a2_0><b6_0>polychaetes<b6_0/><a2_0/>, and are thought to be <a3_0><b7_0>chemosensors<b7_0/><a3_0/>. Some polychaetes also have various combinations of <a4_0><b8_0>ocelli<b8_0/><a4_0/> (\"little eyes\") that detect the direction from which light is coming and camera eyes or compound eyes that can probably form images. The compound eyes probably evolved independently of arthropods' eyes. Some tube-worms use ocelli widely spread over their bodies to detect the shadows of fish, so that they can quickly withdraw into their tubes. Some burrowing and tube-dwelling polychaetes have statocysts (tilt and balance sensors) that tell them which way is down. A few polychaete genera have on the undersides of their heads palps that are used both in feeding and as \"feelers\", and some of these also have antennae that are structurally similar but probably are used mainly as \"feelers\"."}
