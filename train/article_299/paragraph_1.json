Each segment has the same sets of organs and, in most polychaetes, has a pair of parapodia that many species use for locomotion. <a0_0><b5_0>Septa<b5_0/><a0_0/> separate the segments of many species, but are poorly defined or absent in others, and <a1_0><b6_0>Echiura and Sipuncula<b6_0/><a1_0/> show no obvious signs of segmentation. In species with well-developed septa, the blood circulates entirely within blood vessels, and the vessels in segments near the <a2_0><b7_0>front<b7_0/><a2_0/> ends of these species are often built up with muscles that act as hearts. The septa of such species also enable them to change the shapes of individual segments, which facilitates movement by <a3_0><b8_0>peristalsis<b8_0/><a3_0/> (\"ripples\" that pass along the body) or by undulations that improve the effectiveness of the parapodia. In species with incomplete septa or none, the blood circulates through the main body cavity without any kind of pump, and there is a wide range of locomotory techniques \u2013 some burrowing species <a4_0><b9_0>turn their pharynges inside out to drag themselves<b9_0/><a4_0/> through the sediment."}
