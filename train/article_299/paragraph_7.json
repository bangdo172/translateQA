These are secreted by the one-cell deep epidermis (outermost skin layer). A few marine annelids that live in tubes lack cuticles, but their tubes have a similar structure, and <a2_0><b7_0>mucus-secreting glands in the epidermis<b7_0/><a2_0/> protect their skins. Under the epidermis is <a3_0><b8_0>the dermis<b8_0/><a3_0/>, which is made of connective tissue, in other words a combination of cells and non-cellular materials such as collagen. Below this are two layers of muscles, which develop from the lining of the coelom <a4_0>(body cavity<a4_0/>): circular muscles make a segment longer and slimmer when they contract, while under them are longitudinal muscles, usually four distinct strips, whose contractions make the segment shorter and fatter. Some annelids also have oblique internal muscles that connect the underside of the body to each side."}
