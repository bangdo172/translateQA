Parapodia are <a3_0><b7_0>unjointed paired extensions of the body wall<b7_0/><a3_0/>, and their muscles are derived from the circular muscles of the body. They are often supported internally by one or more large, thick chetae. The parapodia of burrowing and tube-dwelling <b6_0>polychaetes<b6_0/> are often just <a1_0><b5_0>ridges whose tips bear hooked chetae<b5_0/><a1_0/>. In active crawlers and swimmers the parapodia are often divided into large upper and lower paddles on a very short trunk, and the paddles are generally fringed with chetae and sometimes with cirri (<a0_0><b4_0>fused bundles of cilia<b4_0/><a0_0/>) and gills."}
