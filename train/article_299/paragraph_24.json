Some burrow while others live entirely on the surface, <a2_0><b7_0>generally in moist leaf litter<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The burrowers loosen the soil so that <a3_0><b8_0>oxygen and water can penetrate it<b8_0/><a3_0/>, and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing organic and mineral matter, by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms, and by concentrating minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily. Earthworms are also important prey for birds ranging in size from robins to <a4_0><b9_0>storks<b9_0/><a4_0/>, and for mammals ranging from shrews to badgers, and in some cases conserving earthworms may be essential for conserving endangered birds."}
