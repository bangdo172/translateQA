Higher levels of <a1_0>carbon dioxide<a1_0/> in the atmosphere are thought to have caused the world <b6_0>temperature gradient from north to south to become almost flat<b6_0/>: <a2_0>temperatures<a2_0/> were about the same across the planet. Average <b9_0>temperatures were also higher<b9_0/> than today by about 10\u00b0C. In fact, by the middle Cretaceous, equatorial ocean waters (perhaps as warm as 20 \u00b0C in the deep ocean) may have been too warm for sea life,[dubious \u2013 discuss][citation needed] and land areas near the equator may have been <a3_0>deserts<a3_0/> despite their proximity to water. The <b8_0>circulation of oxygen<b8_0/> to the deep ocean may also have been disrupted.[dubious \u2013 discuss] For this reason, large volumes of organic matter that was unable to decompose accumulated, eventually being deposited as \"<a4_0>black shale<a4_0/>\"."}
