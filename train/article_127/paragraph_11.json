The Mesozoic was a time of significant <a2_0>tectonic<a2_0/>, climate and <a3_0><b6_0>evolutionary<b6_0/><a3_0/> activity. The era witnessed the gradual <b7_0>rifting<b7_0/> of the supercontinent Pangaea into separate landmasses that would eventually move into their current positions. The climate of the Mesozoic was varied, alternating between warming and cooling periods. Overall, however, the Earth was hotter than it is today. Non-avian dinosaurs appeared in the <b8_0>Late Triassic<b8_0/> and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates early in the Jurassic, occupying this position for about 135 million years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous. Birds first appeared in the Jurassic, having evolved from a branch of <b9_0>theropod<b9_0/> dinosaurs. The first mammals also appeared during the Mesozoic, but would remain small\u2014less than 15 kg (33 lb)\u2014until the <a4_0>Cenozoic<a4_0/>."}
