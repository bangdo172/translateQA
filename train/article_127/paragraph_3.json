The Late Cretaceous featured a <a1_0><b5_0>cooling<b5_0/><a1_0/> trend that would continue on in the Cenozoic period. Eventually, <a2_0>tropics<a2_0/> were restricted to the equator and areas beyond the tropic lines featured <a3_0>extreme seasonal changes<a3_0/> in weather. Dinosaurs still thrived as new species such as <b6_0>Tyrannosaurus<b6_0/>, <b9_0>Ankylosaurus<b9_0/>, Triceratops and Hadrosaurs dominated the food web. In the oceans, Mosasaurs ruled the seas to fill the role of the <b7_0>Ichthyosaurs<b7_0/>, and huge plesiosaurs, such as Elasmosaurus, evolved. Also, the first flowering plants evolved. At the end of the Cretaceous, the Deccan traps and other volcanic eruptions were poisoning the atmosphere. As this was continuing, it is thought that a large meteor smashed into earth, creating the Chicxulub Crater in an event known as the <a4_0>K-T Extinction<a4_0/>, the fifth and most recent mass extinction event, in which 75% of life on earth went extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. Everything over 10 kilograms went extinct. The age of the dinosaurs was over."}
