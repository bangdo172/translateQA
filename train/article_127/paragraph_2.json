It is also known as the \"<a3_0>Great Dying<a3_0/>\" because it is considered the largest mass extinction in the Earth's history. The upper (Cretaceous) boundary is set at the Cretaceous\u2013Tertiary (KT) extinction event (now more accurately called the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene (or <a4_0>K\u2013Pg) extinction<a4_0/> event), which may have been caused by the impactor that created Chicxulub Crater on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.
