The sole major <b8_0>Mesozoic orogeny<b8_0/> occurred in what is now the <a1_0>Arctic<a1_0/>, creating the Innuitian orogeny, the Brooks Range, the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges in Siberia, and the Khingan Mountains in Manchuria. This orogeny was related to the opening of the Arctic Ocean and subduction of the North China and Siberian cratons under the Pacific Ocean. Nevertheless, the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea. <a2_0><b7_0>Pangaea<b7_0/><a2_0/> gradually split into a northern continent, <a3_0><b6_0>Laurasia<b6_0/><a3_0/>, and a southern continent, <a4_0>Gondwana<a4_0/>. This created the passive continental margin that characterizes most of the Atlantic coastline (such as along the U.S. East Coast) today."}
