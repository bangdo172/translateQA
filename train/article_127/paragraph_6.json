The Early Cretaceous saw the <a1_0><b5_0>expansion of seaways<b5_0/><a1_0/>, and as a result, the decline and extinction of sauropods (except in South America). Many <b7_0>coastal shallows<b7_0/> were created, and that caused <a2_0>Ichthyosaurs<a2_0/> to die out. <a3_0>Mosasaurs<a3_0/> evolved to replace them as head of the seas. Some island-hopping dinosaurs, like Eustreptospondylus, evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient Europe. Other dinosaurs rose up to fill the empty space that the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction left behind, such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus. Of the most successful would be the <a4_0><b6_0>Iguanodon<b6_0/><a4_0/> which spread to every continent. Seasons came back into effect and the poles got seasonally colder, but dinosaurs still inhabited this area like the <b8_0>Leaellynasaura<b8_0/> which inhabited the polar forests year-round, and many dinosaurs migrated there during summer like Muttaburrasaurus. Since it was too cold for crocodiles, it was the last stronghold for large amphibians, like <b9_0>Koolasuchus<b9_0/>. Pterosaurs got larger as species like Tapejara and Ornithocheirus evolved."}
