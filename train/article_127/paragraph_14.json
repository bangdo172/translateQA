With its high specific heat capacity, water acts as a temperature-stabilizing heat reservoir, and land areas near large bodies of water\u2014especially the oceans\u2014experience less variation in temperature. Because much of the land that constituted Pangaea was distant from the oceans, temperatures fluctuated greatly, and the interior of Pangaea probably included expansive areas of <a2_0>desert<a2_0/>. Abundant red beds and evaporites such as halite support these conclusions, but evidence exists that the generally <b6_0>dry climate<b6_0/> of the Triassic was punctuated by episodes of <a3_0><a4_0>increased rainfall<a4_0/><a3_0/>. Most important humid episodes were the Carnian Pluvial Event and one in the Rhaetian, few million years before the Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event."}
