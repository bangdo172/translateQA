Through the study of past literature we are able to learn about how society has evolved and about the societal norms during each of the different periods all throughout history. This can even help us to understand references made in more <b12_0>modern<b12_0/> literature because authors often make references to <a4_0>Greek mythology and other <b7_0>old religious texts or historical moments<b7_0/><a4_0/>. Not only is there literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves, and how they have evolved throughout history (like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science, for example) but we can also learn about these things in fictional works. Authors often include historical moments in their works, like when <a2_0><b13_0><b16_0>Lord Byron<b16_0/><b13_0/><a2_0/> talks about the <b9_0>Spanish and <b17_0>the French<b17_0/><b9_0/> in <b8_0>\u2018\u2018Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage: Canto I\u2019\u2019<b8_0/> and expresses his opinions through his character <b14_0>Childe Harold<b14_0/>. Through <b18_0>literature<b18_0/> we are able to continuously uncover new information about history. It is easy to see how all academic fields have roots in literature. Information became easier to pass down from generation to generation <a3_0>once we began to write it down<a3_0/>. Eventually everything was written down, from things like home remedies and cures for illness, or how to build shelter to traditions and religious practices. From there people were able to study literature, improve on ideas, further our knowledge, and academic fields such as the medical field or trades could be started. In much the same way as the literature that we study today continue to be updated as we continue to evolve and learn more and more."}
