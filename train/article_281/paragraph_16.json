Although a foundation in the liberal arts and sciences is required in all majors, there is no required common core curriculum; individual degree requirements are set by <a1_0><b6_0>the faculty<b6_0/> of each school<a1_0/>. Northwestern's full-time undergraduate and graduate programs operate on an <a4_0><b9_0>approximately 10<b9_0/><a4_0/>-week academic quarter system with the academic year beginning in late September and ending in early June. Undergraduates typically take <a3_0><b8_0>four<b8_0/><a3_0/> courses each quarter and twelve courses in an academic year and are required to complete <a2_0><b7_0>at least twelve<b7_0/><a2_0/> quarters on campus to graduate. Northwestern offers honors, accelerated, and joint degree programs in medicine, science, mathematics, engineering, and journalism. The comprehensive doctoral graduate program has high coexistence with undergraduate programs."}
