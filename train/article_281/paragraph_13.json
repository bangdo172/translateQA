New construction and renovation projects will be designed to provide <a1_0><b6_0>at least a 20%<a1_0/> improvement<b6_0/> over energy code requirements where technically feasible. The university also released at the beginning of the 2008\u201309 academic year the Evanston Campus Framework Plan, which outlines plans for <a2_0><b7_0>future development of the Evanston Campus<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The plan not only emphasizes the sustainable construction of buildings, but also discusses improving transportation by optimizing pedestrian and bicycle access. Northwestern has had a comprehensive recycling program in place since 1990. Annually more than <a3_0><b8_0>1,500<b8_0/><a3_0/> tons are recycled at Northwestern, which represents 30% of the waste produced on campus. Additionally, all landscape waste at the university is <a4_0><b9_0>composted<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
