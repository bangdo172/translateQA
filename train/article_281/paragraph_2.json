The first building, <a0_0><b5_0>Old College<b5_0/><a0_0/>, opened on November 5, 1855. To raise funds for its construction, Northwestern sold <a1_0><b6_0>$100 \"perpetual scholarships\"<b6_0/><a1_0/> entitling <a2_0>the <b7_0>purchaser and his heirs<b7_0/><a2_0/> to free tuition. Another building, University Hall, was built in 1869 of the same Joliet limestone as the Chicago Water Tower, also built in 1869, one of the few buildings in the heart of Chicago to survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. In 1873 the <a3_0><b8_0>Evanston College for Ladies<b8_0/><a3_0/> merged with Northwestern, and <a4_0>Frances Willard<a4_0/>, who later gained fame as a suffragette and as one of the founders of the Woman's <b9_0>Christian Temperance<b9_0/> Union (WCTU), became the school's first dean of women. Willard Residential College (1938) is named in her honor. Northwestern admitted its first women students in 1869, and the first woman was graduated in 1874."}
