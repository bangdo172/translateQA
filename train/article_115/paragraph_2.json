Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation almost always results in the <a1_0>death<a1_0/> of the prey. The other main category of consumption is <a2_0>detritivory<a2_0/>, the consumption of dead organic matter. It can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours, for example, where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for <a3_0>their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse<a3_0/>. Selective pressures imposed on one another has led to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in <a4_0>various antipredator adaptations<a4_0/>."}
