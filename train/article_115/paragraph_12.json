The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as <a1_0>snails, clams, and squids<a1_0/>, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as <a2_0>earthworms and leeches<a2_0/>. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the <a3_0>common presence of trochophore larvae<a3_0/>, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. Now, this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla. The Lophotrochozoa also include the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a <a4_0>lophophore<a4_0/>. These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. but it now appears that the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic, with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids. They include the Brachiopoda or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record, the Entoprocta, the Phoronida, and possibly the Bryozoa or moss animals."}
