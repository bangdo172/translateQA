The largest animal phylum belongs here, the Arthropoda, including <a1_0>insects, spiders, crabs<a1_0/>, and their kin. All these organisms have a body divided into <a2_0>repeating segments<a2_0/>, typically with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the <a3_0>Onychophora and Tardigrada<a3_0/>, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the <a4_0>Nematoda<a4_0/> or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water. A number are important parasites. Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom."}
