In sponges, blastula larvae <a1_0>swim to a new location<a1_0/> and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber, and two separate germ layers \u2014 <a2_0>an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm<a2_0/>.
