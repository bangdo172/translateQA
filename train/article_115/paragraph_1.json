This may be calcified to form structures like <a2_0>shells, bones, and spicules<a2_0/>. During development, it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized, making complex structures possible. In contrast, other multicellular organisms, like plants and fungi, have cells held in place by <a3_0>cell walls<a3_0/>, and so develop by progressive growth. Also, unique to animal cells are the following intercellular junctions: <a4_0>tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes<a4_0/>."}
