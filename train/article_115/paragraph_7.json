Their closest known living relatives are the <a1_0>choanoflagellates<a1_0/>, collared flagellates that have a morphology similar to the choanocytes of certain sponges. Molecular studies place animals in a supergroup called the <a2_0>opisthokonts<a2_0/>, which also include the <a3_0>choanoflagellates, fungi and a few small parasitic protists<a3_0/>. The name comes from <a4_0>the posterior location of the flagellum in motile cells<a4_0/>, such as most animal spermatozoa, whereas other eukaryotes tend to have anterior flagella."}
