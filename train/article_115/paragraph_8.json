For the most part, they are bilaterally symmetric, and often have a specialized head with feeding and sensory organs. The body is triploblastic, i.e. all three germ layers are well-developed, and tissues form distinct organs. The digestive chamber has <a1_0>two<a1_0/> openings, a <a2_0>mouth and an anus<a2_0/>, and there is also an internal body cavity called a <a3_0>coelom or pseudocoelom<a3_0/>. There are exceptions to each of these characteristics, however \u2014 for instance adult echinoderms are radially symmetric, and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures."}
