These were originally considered some of the most primitive Bilateria, but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors. A number of parasites are included in this group, such as the <a1_0>flukes and tapeworms<a1_0/>. Flatworms are acoelomates, <a2_0>lacking a body cavity<a2_0/>, as are their closest relatives, the microscopic <a3_0>Gastrotricha<a3_0/>. The other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate. The most prominent are the Rotifera or rotifers, which are common <a4_0>in aqueous environments<a4_0/>. They also include the Acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms, the Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and possibly the Cycliophora. These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are called the Gnathifera."}
