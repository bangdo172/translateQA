Animals from <a0_0>both groups possess a complete digestive tract<a0_0/>. However, in protostomes, the first opening of the gut to appear in embryological development (the archenteron) develops into the mouth, with the anus forming secondarily. In <a1_0>deuterostomes<a1_0/> the anus forms first, with the mouth developing secondarily. In most protostomes, cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm, called <a2_0>schizocoelous development<a2_0/>, but in deuterostomes, it forms through invagination of the endoderm, called <a3_0>enterocoelic pouching<a3_0/>. Deuterostome embryos undergo <a4_0>radial cleavage<a4_0/> during cell division, while protostomes undergo spiral cleavage."}
