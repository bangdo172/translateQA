Most plants use <a1_0>light<a1_0/> to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other biomolecules, characteristically containing reduced carbon in the form of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Starting with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into <a2_0>chemical energy<a2_0/> in the form of simple sugars (e.g., glucose), with the release of molecular oxygen. These sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth, including the production of other biomolecules. When an animal eats plants (or eats other animals which have eaten plants), the reduced carbon compounds in the food <a3_0>become a source of energy and building materials for the animal<a3_0/>. They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and <a4_0>giving the animal the energy required for motion<a4_0/>."}
