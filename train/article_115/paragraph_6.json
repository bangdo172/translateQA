Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period indicate the presence of <a1_0>triploblastic worms<a1_0/>, like metazoans, roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as <a2_0>earthworms<a2_0/>. During the beginning of the Tonian period <a3_0>around 1 billion years ago<a3_0/>, there was a decrease in Stromatolite diversity, which may indicate the appearance of grazing animals, since stromatolite diversity increased when grazing animals went extinct at the End Permian and End Ordovician extinction events, and decreased shortly after the grazer populations recovered. However the discovery that tracks very similar to these early trace fossils are produced today by the giant single-celled protist <a4_0>Gromia sphaerica<a4_0/> casts doubt on their interpretation as evidence of early animal evolution."}
