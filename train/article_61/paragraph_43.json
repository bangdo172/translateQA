People must remember to <a2_0>change their clocks<a2_0/>; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of <a3_0>multiple DST rules<a3_0/>, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 <a0_0>twice<a0_0/>, possibly leading to <a1_0>confusion<a1_0/>."}
