The European Union shifts all at once, at 01:00 UTC or 02:00 CET or 03:00 EET; for example, <a0_0>Eastern European Time<a0_0/> is always <a3_0>one hour<a3_0/> ahead of Central European Time. Most of North America shifts at 02:00 local time, so its zones do not shift at the same time; for example, Mountain Time is temporarily (for one hour) zero hours ahead of Pacific Time, instead of one hour ahead, in the autumn and <a1_0>two hours<a1_0/>, instead of one, ahead of Pacific Time in the spring. In the past, Australian districts went even further and did not always agree on start and end dates; for example, in 2008 most DST-observing areas shifted clocks forward on October 5 but Western Australia shifted on <a2_0>October 26<a2_0/>. In some cases only part of a country shifts; for example, in the US, <a4_0>Hawaii<a4_0/> and most of Arizona do not observe DST."}
