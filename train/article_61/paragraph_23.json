Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it after the war. <a0_0>Britain<a0_0/> was an exception: it retained DST nationwide but over the years adjusted transition dates for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on <a1_0>Easter<a1_0/> mornings. The US was more typical: Congress repealed DST after <a2_0>1919<a2_0/>. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid <a3_0>golf<a3_0/>er, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden. Only a few US cities retained DST locally thereafter, including <a4_0>New York<a4_0/> so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York. Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding opposed DST as a \"deception\". Reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer, he ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 08:00 rather than 09:00 during summer 1922. Some businesses followed suit though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated."}
