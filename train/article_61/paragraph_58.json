This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems that set the clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with <a1_0>a rescue boot disk<a1_0/>. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only <a2_0>a single system-wide setting<a2_0/>. In <a3_0>2008<a3_0/> Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least <a4_0>two<a4_0/> fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft."}
