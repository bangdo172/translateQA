This database is used by many computer software systems, including most Unix-like operating systems, Java, and the Oracle RDBMS; HP's \"<a4_0>tztab<a4_0/>\" database is similar but incompatible. When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary <a1_0>system maintenance<a1_0/>. In Unix-like systems the <a2_0>TZ<a2_0/> environment variable specifies the location name, as in TZ=':America/New_York'. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable isn't set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the /etc/localtime file, which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in <a3_0>timezone-independent epoch time<a3_0/>; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display."}
