Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows Vista supports at most <a2_0>two<a2_0/> start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both <a3_0>1987<a3_0/>\u2013<a4_0>2006<a4_0/> and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps."}
