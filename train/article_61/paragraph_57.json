For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied each year and was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for <a0_0>1995<a0_0/> only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft <a1_0>marked Israel as not having DST<a1_0/>, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually <a2_0>twice a year<a2_0/>. <a3_0>The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law<a3_0/> established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to <a4_0>the Gregorian calendar<a4_0/>."}
