For example, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, is at 106\u00b039\u2032 W longitude, slightly west of center of the idealized Mountain Time Zone (105\u00b0 W), but the time in Saskatchewan is <a2_0>Central Standard Time<a2_0/> (90\u00b0 W) year-round, so Saskatoon is always about <a1_0>67<a1_0/> minutes ahead of mean solar time, thus effectively observing daylight saving time year-round. Conversely, northeast India and a few other areas skew time zones eastward, in effect observing <a3_0>negative DST<a3_0/>. The United Kingdom and Ireland experimented with year-round DST from 1968 to <a4_0>1971<a4_0/> but abandoned it because of its unpopularity, particularly in northern regions."}
