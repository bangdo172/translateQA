Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the <a1_0>morning<a1_0/>. As <a4_0>Franklin<a4_0/>'s 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of <a2_0>incandescent<a2_0/> lighting, which used to be a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, <a3_0>climate<a3_0/>, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies."}
