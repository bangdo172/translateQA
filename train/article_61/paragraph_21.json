The proposal attracted many supporters, including Balfour, Churchill, Lloyd George, MacDonald, <a0_0>Edward VII<a0_0/> (who used half-hour DST at Sandringham), the managing director of Harrods, and the manager of the National Bank. However, the opposition was stronger: it included Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, Christie (the Astronomer Royal), George Darwin, <a1_0>Napier Shaw<a1_0/> (director of the Meteorological Office), many agricultural organizations, and theatre owners. After many hearings the proposal was narrowly defeated in a Parliament committee vote in <a2_0>1909<a2_0/>. Willett's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914, to no avail. The US was even more skeptical: <a3_0>Andrew Peters<a3_0/> introduced a DST bill to the US House of Representatives in May 1909, but it soon died in committee."}
