For example, Roman <a0_0>water clocks<a0_0/> had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, <a1_0>hora tertia<a1_0/>, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted <a2_0>75<a2_0/> minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some Mount Athos monasteries and all <a3_0>Jewish<a3_0/> ceremonies."}
