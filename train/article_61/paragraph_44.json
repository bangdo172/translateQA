Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; <a2_0>software developers<a2_0/> must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules, or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the <a3_0>Coordinated Universal Time<a3_0/> (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, <a4_0>Unix-based<a4_0/> computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally."}
