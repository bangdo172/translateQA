This strategy was to a degree forced upon France: <a1_0>geography, coupled with the superiority of the British navy, made it difficult<a1_0/> for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to French colonies. Similarly, <a2_0>several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative<a2_0/> for any French ruler. Given these military necessities, the French government, unsurprisingly, based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in Europe: it would keep most of its army on the continent, hoping for victories closer to home. The plan was to fight to the end of hostilities and then, <a3_0>in treaty negotiations, to trade territorial acquisitions in Europe to regain lost overseas possessions.<a3_0/> This approach did not serve France well in the war, as the colonies were indeed lost, but although much of the European war went well, by its end <a4_0>France had few counterbalancing European successes."}
