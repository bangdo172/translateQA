The Prussians then occupied Saxony; after the Siege of Pirna, the <a2_0>Saxon army surrendered in October 1756, and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army<a2_0/>. The <a3_0>attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage<a3_0/> across Europe and <a4_0>led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition<a4_0/>. The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia. Far from being easy, Frederick's early successes proved indecisive and very costly for Prussia's smaller army. This led him to remark that he did not fight the same Austrians as he had during the previous war."}
