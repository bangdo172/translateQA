The now-isolated <a2_0>France<a3_0/> was forced to accede to the Austro-Russian alliance<a2_0/> or face ruin. Thereafter, on May 1, 1756, the First Treaty of Versailles was signed, in which both nations pledged <a4_0>24.000 troops<a4_0/> to defend each other in the case of an attack. This diplomatic revolution proved to be an important cause of the war; although both treaties were self-defensive in nature, the actions of both coalitions made the war virtually inevitable."}
