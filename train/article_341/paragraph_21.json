Hegel agrees with <a1_0><b6_0>Kierkegaard<b6_0/><a1_0/> that both reality and humans are incomplete, inasmuch as we are in time, and reality develops through time. But the relation between time and eternity is outside time and this is the \"logical structure\" that Hegel thinks we can know. Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between <b7_0>ontology and epistemology<b7_0/>. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of <a2_0><b8_0>abstraction<b8_0/><a2_0/>, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings. In addition, because <a3_0>we are finite beings<a3_0/>, we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as God, so we cannot know God exists, since that which transcends <b9_0>time<b9_0/> simultaneously transcends <a4_0>human understanding<a4_0/>."}
