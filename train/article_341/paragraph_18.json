For Hegel there must be <b6_0>some identity of thought and being<b6_0/> for the \"subject\" (<a1_0>any human observer<a1_0/>)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (<a2_0>any external entity<a2_0/>, possibly even another human) at all. Under <b7_0>Hegel<b7_0/>'s concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have <a0_0>Spirit<a0_0/> (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from <b8_0>Spirit<b8_0/> to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is himself, because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes <a3_0>Absolute Spirit<a3_0/>, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of <a4_0>self<a4_0/>-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" The picture Hegel presents is \"a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.\""}
