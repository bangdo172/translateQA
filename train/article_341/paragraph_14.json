He defined the ideal as being mental pictures that constitute <a4_0><b8_0><b9_0>subjective<b9_0/><a4_0/> knowledge<b8_0/>. The ideal, for him, is what can be attributed to <a1_0>our own minds<a1_0/>. The images in our head are what comprise the ideal. Schopenhauer emphasized that we are restricted to <a2_0><b6_0>our own consciousness<b6_0/><a2_0/>. The world that appears is only a representation or mental picture of objects. We directly and immediately know only <a3_0>representations<a3_0/>. All objects that are external to the mind are known indirectly through the <b7_0>mediation of our mind<b7_0/>. He offered a history of the concept of the \"ideal\" as \"ideational\" or \"existing in the mind as an image\"."}
