Thus Kant defines idealism as \"the assertion that we can never be certain <b6_0>whether all of our putative outer experience is not mere imagining<b6_0/>\". He claimed that, according to idealism, \"the reality of external objects does not admit of <b7_0>strict proof<b7_0/>. On the contrary, however, the reality of the object of our internal sense (of myself and state) is clear immediately through consciousness.\"  However, not all idealists restrict the real or the knowable to our immediate subjective experience. <b8_0>Objective<b8_0/> idealists make claims about a transempirical world, but simply deny that this world is essentially divorced from or ontologically prior to the mental. Thus Plato and <a3_0><b9_0>Gottfried Leibniz<b9_0/><a3_0/> affirm an objective and knowable reality transcending our subjective awareness\u2014a rejection of epistemological idealism\u2014but propose that this reality is grounded in ideal entities, a form of metaphysical idealism. Nor do all metaphysical idealists agree on the nature of the ideal; for Plato, the fundamental entities were non-mental abstract forms, while for <a4_0>Leibniz<a4_0/> they were proto-mental and concrete monads."}
