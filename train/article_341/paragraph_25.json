M. E. McTaggart<b7_0/> of <a0_0>Cambridge<a0_0/> University, argued that <a2_0>minds<a2_0/> alone exist and only relate to each other through <a3_0>love<a3_0/>. Space, time and material objects are <a4_0>unreal<a4_0/>. In The Unreality of Time he argued that time is an illusion because it is impossible to produce a coherent account of a sequence of events. <b6_0>The Nature of Existence<b6_0/> (<a1_0><b5_0>1927<b5_0/><a1_0/>) contained his arguments that space, time, and matter cannot possibly be real. In his Studies in Hegelian Cosmology (Cambridge, 1901, p196) he declared that metaphysics are not relevant to <b8_0>social and political action<b8_0/>. McTaggart \"thought that Hegel was wrong in supposing that metaphysics could show that the state is more than a means to the good of the individuals who compose it\". For McTaggart \"philosophy can give us very little, if any, guidance in action... Why should <b9_0>a Hegelian citizen<b9_0/> be surprised that his belief as to the organic nature of the Absolute does not help him in deciding how to vote? Would a Hegelian engineer be reasonable in expecting that his belief that all matter is spirit should help him in planning a bridge?"}
