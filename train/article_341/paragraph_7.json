Arne Gr\u00f8n calls this doctrine \"the classic example of a metaphysical idealism as a transcendent idealism\", while <a1_0>Simone Klein<a1_0/> calls Plato \"the earliest representative of metaphysical objective idealism\". Nevertheless, Plato holds that matter is real, though transitory and imperfect, and is perceived by our body and its senses and given existence by the eternal ideas that are perceived directly by our rational soul. Plato was therefore a <a2_0><b6_0>metaphysical and epistemological<b6_0/><a2_0/> dualist, an outlook that modern idealism has striven to avoid: Plato's thought cannot therefore be counted as idealist in the modern sense, although <a3_0><b7_0>quantum<b7_0/><a3_0/> physics' assertion that man's consciousness is an immutable and primary requisite for not merely perceiving but shaping matter, and thus his reality, would give more credence to <b8_0>Plato<b8_0/>'s dualist position.[citation needed]"}
