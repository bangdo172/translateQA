A. Luce and John <a3_0>Foster<a3_0/> are other <a0_0>subjectivists<a0_0/>. Luce, in <a1_0><b6_0>Sense without Matter<b6_0/><a1_0/> (<a2_0><b5_0>1954<b5_0/><a2_0/>), attempts to bring <a4_0><b9_0>Berkeley<b9_0/><a4_0/> up to date by modernizing <b7_0>his vocabulary<b7_0/> and putting the issues he faced in modern terms, and treats the Biblical account of matter and the psychology of perception and nature. Foster's <b8_0>The Case for Idealism<b8_0/> argues that the physical world is the logical creation of natural, non-logical constraints on human sense-experience. Foster's latest defense of his views is in his book A World for Us: The Case for Phenomenalistic Idealism."}
