Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of <b7_0>knowing any <a1_0>mind-independent<a1_0/> thing<b7_0/>. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas\u2014especially <a3_0><b8_0>beliefs and values<b8_0/><a3_0/>\u2014shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit.
