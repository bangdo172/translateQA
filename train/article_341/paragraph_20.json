Individual human will ought, at the State's highest level of development, to properly coincide with the will of the <a3_0>State<a3_0/>. Climacus rejects Hegel's <b8_0>suppression of <a2_0>individuality<b8_0/><a2_0/> by pointing out it is impossible to create a valid set of rules or system in any society which can adequately describe existence for any one individual. Submitting one's will to the State denies personal freedom, choice, and responsibility."}
