The theology of Christian Science includes a form of idealism: it teaches that <b8_0>all that truly exists is God and God's ideas<b8_0/>; that the world as it appears to the senses is a distortion of the underlying spiritual reality, a distortion that may be corrected (both conceptually and in terms of human experience) through a reorientation (spiritualization) of thought."}
