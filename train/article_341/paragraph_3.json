It comes via idea from the <a3_0>Greek<a3_0/> idein (\u1f30\u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd), meaning \"<a0_0><b6_0>to see<b6_0/><a0_0/>\". The term entered the English language by <a1_0><b4_0>1743<b4_0/><a1_0/>. In ordinary use, as when speaking of <b5_0>Woodrow Wilson<b5_0/>'s political idealism, it generally suggests the priority of ideals, principles, values, and goals over concrete realities. Idealists are understood to represent the world as it might or should be, unlike <a2_0><b7_0>pragmatists<b7_0/><a2_0/>, who focus on the world as it presently is. In the arts, similarly, idealism <b8_0>affirms imagination and attempts to realize a mental conception of beauty<b8_0/>, a standard of perfection, juxtaposed to aesthetic naturalism and realism."}
