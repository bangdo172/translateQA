Qualitative infinity, on the other hand, would be more self-determining and hence more fully real. Similarly finite natural things are less \"real\"\u2014because they are <a2_0>less self-determining<a2_0/>\u2014than spiritual things like <b9_0>morally responsible people, <a3_0>ethical communities<a3_0/> and God<b9_0/>.
