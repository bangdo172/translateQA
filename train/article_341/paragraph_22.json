E. Moore<b7_0/>'s radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not understand <b4_0>the statement that something is real<b4_0/>. We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to <a0_0>Moore<a0_0/>. The 1903 article <b3_0>The Refutation of Idealism<b3_0/> is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism <b5_0>esse est percipi<b5_0/>, \"to be is to be perceived\", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are necessarily connected so that \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" are identical - \"to be yellow\" is \"to be experienced as yellow\". But it also seems there is a difference between \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" and \"that esse is held to be percipi, solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it\". Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by <a2_0>Berkeley<a2_0/>. This argument did not show that the <b6_0>GEM<b6_0/> (in post\u2013Stove vernacular, see below) is logically invalid."}
