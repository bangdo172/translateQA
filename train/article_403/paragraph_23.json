While the intense training has become longer, it also has shifted to include a deployment phase. This deployment phase, now called the <a1_0>BEAST<a1_0/>, places the trainees in a surreal environment that they may experience once they deploy. While the trainees do tackle the massive obstacle courses along with the BEAST, the other portions include defending and protecting their base of operations, forming a structure of leadership, <a2_0>directing search and recovery<a2_0/>, and basic self aid buddy care. During this event, the <a3_0>Military Training Instructors<a3_0/> (MTI) act as mentors and enemy forces in a deployment exercise."}
