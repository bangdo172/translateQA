While all USAF military personnel are referred to as Airmen, the term also refers to the pay grades of E-1 through E-4, which are below the level of non-commissioned officers (NCOs). Above the pay grade of E-4 (i.e., pay grades E-5 through E-9) all ranks fall into the category of NCO and are further subdivided into \"NCOs\" (pay grades E-5 and E-6) and \"Senior NCOs\" (<a2_0>pay grades E-7 through E-9<a2_0/>); the term \"Junior NCO\" is sometimes used to refer to <a3_0>staff sergeants and technical sergeants<a3_0/> (pay grades E-5 and E-6)."}
