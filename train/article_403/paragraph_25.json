Michael Moseley<a2_0/>. Gates in effect fired both men for \"systemic issues associated with declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance.\" This followed an investigation into two embarrassing incidents involving mishandling of nuclear weapons: specifically a nuclear weapons incident aboard a B-52 flight between Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB, and an accidental shipment of nuclear weapons components to <a3_0>Taiwan<a3_0/>. The resignations were also the culmination of disputes between the Air Force leadership, populated primarily by non-nuclear background fighter pilots, versus Gates. To put more emphasis on nuclear assets, the USAF established the nuclear-focused Air Force Global Strike Command on <a4_0>24 October 2008<a4_0/>."}
