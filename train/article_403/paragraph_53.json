Magruder, Jr defines USAF culture as a combination of the rigorous application of advanced technology, individualism and progressive airpower theory. <a0_0>Major General Charles J. Dunlap, Jr.<a0_0/> adds that the U.S. Air Force's culture also includes an egalitarianism bred from officers perceiving themselves as their service's principal \"warriors\" working with small groups of enlisted airmen either as the service crew or the onboard crew of their aircraft. Air Force officers have never felt they needed the formal social \"distance\" from their enlisted force that is common in the other U.S. armed services. Although the paradigm is changing, for most of its history, the Air Force, completely unlike its sister services, has been <a1_0>an organization in which mostly its officers fought<a1_0/>, not its enlisted force, the latter being <a2_0>primarily a rear echelon support force<a2_0/>. When the enlisted force did go into harm's way, such as members of multi-crewed aircraft, the close comradeship of shared risk in tight quarters created traditions that shaped a somewhat different kind of officer/enlisted relationship than exists elsewhere in the military."}
