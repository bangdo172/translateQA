If a crisis occurs, rapid generation and, if necessary, <a1_0>deployment of nuclear strike capabilities<a1_0/> will demonstrate US resolve and may prompt an adversary to alter the course of action deemed threatening to our national interest. Should deterrence fail, the <a2_0>President<a2_0/> may authorize a precise, tailored response to terminate the conflict at the lowest possible level and lead to a rapid cessation of hostilities. Post-conflict, regeneration of a credible nuclear deterrent capability will deter further aggression. The Air Force may present a credible force posture in either the <a4_0>Continental United States<a4_0/>, within a theater of operations, or both to effectively deter the range of potential adversaries envisioned in the 21st century. This requires the ability to engage targets globally using a variety of methods; therefore, the Air Force should possess the ability to induct, train, assign, educate and exercise individuals and units to rapidly and effectively execute missions that support <a3_0>US NDO objectives<a3_0/>. Finally, the Air Force regularly exercises and evaluates all aspects of nuclear operations to ensure high levels of performance."}
