Because of <a1_0>budget constraints<a1_0/>, the USAF planned to reduce the service's size from 360,000 active duty personnel to 316,000. The size of the active duty force in 2007 was roughly 64% of that of what the USAF was at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991. However, the reduction was ended at approximately <a2_0>330,000<a2_0/> personnel in 2008 in order to meet the demand signal of combatant commanders and associated mission requirements. These same constraints have seen a sharp reduction in <a3_0>flight hours for crew training<a3_0/> since 2005 and the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Personnel directing Airmen's Time Assessments."}
