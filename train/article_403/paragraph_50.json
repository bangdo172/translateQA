Many of these fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities, and some are dual-roled as fighter-bombers (e.g., the <a1_0>F-16 Fighting Falcon<a1_0/>); the term \"fighter\" is also sometimes used colloquially for dedicated ground-attack aircraft. Other missions include interception of bombers and other fighters, reconnaissance, and patrol. The <a2_0>F-16<a2_0/> is currently used by the USAF Air Demonstration squadron, the Thunderbirds, while a small number of both man-rated and non-man-rated <a3_0>F-4 Phantom II<a3_0/> are retained as QF-4 aircraft for use as Full Scale Aerial Targets (FSAT) or as part of the USAF Heritage Flight program. These extant QF-4 aircraft are being replaced in the FSAT role by <a4_0>early model F-16 aircraft converted to QF-16 configuration<a4_0/>. The USAF has 2,025 fighters in service as of September 2012."}
