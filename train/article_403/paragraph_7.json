A major goal of DCA operations, in concert with OCA operations, is to provide an area from which forces can operate, secure from air and missile threats. The DCA mission comprises both active and passive defense measures. Active defense is \"the <a2_0>employment of limited offensive action and counterattacks<a2_0/> to deny a contested area or position to the enemy\" (JP 1-02). It includes both <a3_0>ballistic<a3_0/> missile defense and air breathing threat defense, and encompasses point defense, area defense, and high value airborne asset defense. Passive defense is \"measures taken to reduce the probability of and to minimize the effects of damage caused by hostile action without the intention of taking the initiative\" (JP 1-02). It includes detection and warning; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense; camouflage, concealment, and deception; hardening; reconstitution; dispersion; redundancy; and mobility, <a4_0>counter-measures<a4_0/>, and stealth."}
