The workhorses of the USAF Air Mobility Command are the <a1_0>C-130 Hercules, C-17 Globemaster III, and C-5 Galaxy<a1_0/>. These aircraft are largely defined in terms of their range capability as strategic airlift (C-5), strategic/tactical (C-17), and tactical (C-130) airlift to reflect the needs of the land forces they most often support. The CV-22 is used by the Air Force for the <a2_0>U.S. Special Operations Command<a2_0/> (USSOCOM). It conducts long-range, special operations missions, and is equipped with extra fuel tanks and terrain-following radar. Some aircraft serve specialized transportation roles such as executive/embassy support (C-12), Antarctic Support (<a3_0>LC-130H<a3_0/>), and USSOCOM support (C-27J, C-145A, and C-146A). The WC-130H aircraft are former <a4_0>weather reconnaissance aircraft<a4_0/>, now reverted to the transport mission."}
