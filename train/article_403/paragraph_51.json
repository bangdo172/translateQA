The USAF aircraft are equipped primarily for providing the fuel via a <a1_0>tail-mounted refueling boom<a1_0/>, and can be equipped with \"probe and drogue\" refueling systems. Air-to-air refueling is extensively used in <a2_0>large-scale operations<a2_0/> and also used in normal operations; fighters, bombers, and cargo aircraft rely heavily on the lesser-known \"tanker\" aircraft. This makes these aircraft an essential part of the Air Force's global mobility and the U.S. force projection. The <a3_0>KC-46A Pegasus<a3_0/> is undergoing testing and is projected to be delivered to USAF units starting in 2017."}
