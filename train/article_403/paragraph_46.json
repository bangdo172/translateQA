Many attack aircraft, even ones that look like fighters, are optimized to <a0_0>drop bombs<a0_0/>, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks', despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a <a1_0>bomber<a1_0/> is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas <a2_0>fighter bombers and attack aircraft<a2_0/> are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of <a3_0>aerial refueling<a3_0/>, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations. The <a4_0>US, Russia, and the People's Republic of China<a4_0/> operate strategic bombers."}
