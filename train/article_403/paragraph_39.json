The Air Force mirrored the Army from 1976 to 1991 with an E-4 being either a Senior Airman wearing three stripes without a star or a Sergeant (referred to as \"Buck Sergeant\"), which was noted by the presence of the central star and considered an NCO. Despite not being an NCO, a Senior Airman who has <a2_0>completed Airman Leadership School<a2_0/> can be a supervisor according to the AFI 36-2618."}
