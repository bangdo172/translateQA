Because of their political and military importance, destructive power, and the potential consequences of an accident or unauthorized act, nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems require special consideration and protection against risks and threats inherent in their peacetime and wartime environments. The Air Force, in conjunction with other entities within the <a4_0>Departments of Defense or Energy<a4_0/>, achieves a high standard of protection through a stringent nuclear surety program. This program applies to materiel, personnel, and procedures that contribute to the safety, security, and control of nuclear weapons, thus assuring no nuclear accidents, incidents, loss, or <a1_0>unauthorized or accidental use<a1_0/> (a Broken Arrow incident). The Air Force continues to pursue safe, secure and effective nuclear weapons consistent with operational requirements. Adversaries, allies, and the American people must be highly confident of the Air Force's ability to secure nuclear weapons from accidents, theft, loss, and accidental or unauthorized use. This day-to-day commitment to <a2_0>precise and reliable nuclear operations<a2_0/> is the cornerstone of the credibility of the NDO mission. Positive nuclear command, control, communications; <a3_0>effective nuclear weapons security<a3_0/>; and robust combat support are essential to the overall NDO function."}
