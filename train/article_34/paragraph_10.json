The Church had always dealt harshly with strands of Christianity that it considered heretical, but before the <b6_0>11th century<b6_0/> these tended to centre around individual preachers or small localised sects, like <a2_0>Arianism, Pelagianism, Donatism, Marcionism and Montanism<a2_0/>. The diffusion of the almost <b7_0>Manichaean sect of <a3_0>Paulicians<b7_0/><a3_0/> westwards gave birth to the famous 11th and 12th century heresies of Western Europe. The first one was that of Bogomils in modern day Bosnia, a sort of sanctuary between Eastern and Western Christianity. By the 11th century, <b8_0>more organised groups such as the <a4_0>Patarini, the Dulcinians, the Waldensians and the Cathars<a4_0/> were beginning to appear<b8_0/> in the towns and cities of northern Italy, southern France and Flanders."}
