During the thirty-eight years of <a1_0><b6_0><b7_0>Henry VIII<a1_0/>'s<b7_0/><b6_0/> reign, about sixty heretics, mainly Protestants, were executed and a rather greater number of Catholics lost their lives on grounds of political offences such as treason, notably <a2_0><b8_0>Sir Thomas More and Cardinal John Fisher<b8_0/><a2_0/>, for refusing to accept the king's supremacy over the Church in England. Under <a3_0><b9_0>Edward VI<b9_0/><a3_0/>, the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by Mary I; even so two radicals were executed in Edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation, the other for denying Christ's divinity). Under Mary, around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction. When Elizabeth I came to the throne, the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 Act of Supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of \"...a subversive fifth column.\" The last execution of a \"heretic\" in England occurred under James VI and I in <a4_0>1612<a4_0/>. Although the charge was technically one of \"blasphemy\" there was one later execution in Scotland (still at that date an entirely independent kingdom) when in 1697 Thomas Aikenhead was accused, among other things, of denying the doctrine of the Trinity."}
