In May 2013, <b8_0>Obama<b8_0/> stated that the goal is \"to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America\"; which coincided with the <b11_0>U.S. Office of Management and Budget<b11_0/> having changed the wording from \"Overseas Contingency Operations\" to \"<a4_0>Countering Violent Extremism<a4_0/>\" in <b9_0>2010<b9_0/>."}
