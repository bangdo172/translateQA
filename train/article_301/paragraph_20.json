While on a trip to Delhi in 2002, U.S. Secretary of Defense <a1_0>Donald Rumsfeld<a1_0/> suggested that <a2_0>Al-Qaeda<a2_0/> was active in Kashmir, though he did not have any hard evidence. An investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that Al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan's National Intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence. A team of <a3_0>Special Air Service and Delta Force<a3_0/> was sent into Indian-administered Kashmir in 2002 to hunt for <b7_0>Osama bin Laden<b7_0/> after reports that he was being sheltered by the Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. U.S. officials believed that Al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan. <a4_0><b8_0>Fazlur Rehman Khalil<b8_0/><a4_0/>, the leader of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, signed al-Qaeda's 1998 declaration of holy war, which called on Muslims to attack all Americans and their allies. Indian sources claimed that In 2006, Al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir; this worried the Indian government. India also claimed that Al-Qaeda has strong ties with the <b9_0>Kashmir<b9_0/> militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan. While on a visit to Pakistan in January 2010, U.S. Defense secretary Robert Gates stated that Al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan."}
