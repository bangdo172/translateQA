Wright argued that it does not require a trained anthropologist to classify an array of Englishmen, West Africans, and Chinese with 100% accuracy by features, skin color, and type of hair despite so much variability within each of these groups that every <a3_0>individual<a3_0/> can easily be distinguished from every other. However, it is customary to use the term <a4_0>race<a4_0/> rather than subspecies for the major subdivisions of the human species as well as for minor ones."}
