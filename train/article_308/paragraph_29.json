W. F. Edwards argued that rather than using a locus-by-locus analysis of variation to derive taxonomy, it is possible to construct a human classification system based on <a0_0>characteristic genetic patterns<a0_0/>, or clusters inferred from multilocus genetic data. Geographically based human studies since have shown that such genetic clusters can be derived from analyzing of a large number of loci which can assort individuals sampled into groups analogous to traditional continental racial groups. Joanna Mountain and Neil Risch cautioned that while genetic clusters may one day be shown to correspond to <a1_0>phenotypic variations between groups<a1_0/>, such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and complex traits remains <a2_0>poorly<a2_0/> understood. However, Risch denied such limitations render the analysis useless: \"Perhaps just using someone's actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age. Does that mean we should throw it out? ... Any category you come up with is going to be <a3_0>imperfect<a3_0/>, but that doesn't preclude you from using it or the fact that it has <a4_0>utility<a4_0/>.\""}
