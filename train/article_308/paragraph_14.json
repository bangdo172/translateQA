That is, \"the designation 'subspecies' is used to indicate an objective degree of <a1_0>microevolutionary divergence<a1_0/>\" One objection to this idea is that it does not specify what <a2_0>degree of differentiation<a2_0/> is required. Therefore, any population that is somewhat <a3_0>biologically different<a3_0/> could be considered a subspecies, even to the level of a local population. As a result, Templeton has argued that it is necessary to impose a threshold on the <a4_0>level of difference<a4_0/> that is required for a population to be designated a subspecies."}
