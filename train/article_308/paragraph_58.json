One is the system used in <a1_0>the 2001 Census<a1_0/> when individuals identify themselves as belonging to a particular ethnic group: W1 (White-British), W2 (White-Irish), W9 (Any other white background); M1 (White and black Caribbean), M2 (White and black African), M3 (White and Asian), M9 (Any other mixed background); A1 (Asian-Indian), A2 (Asian-Pakistani), A3 (Asian-Bangladeshi), A9 (Any other Asian background); B1 (Black Caribbean), B2 (Black African), B3 (Any other black background); O1 (Chinese), O9 (Any other). The other is categories used by the police when they <a2_0>visually<a2_0/> identify someone as belonging to an ethnic group, e.g. at the time of a stop and search or an arrest: White \u2013 North European (IC1), White \u2013 South European (IC2), Black (IC3), Asian (IC4), Chinese, Japanese, or South East Asian (IC5), Middle Eastern (IC6), and Unknown (IC0). \"IC\" stands for \"<a3_0>Identification Code<a3_0/>;\" these items are also referred to as Phoenix classifications. Officers are instructed to \"record the response that has been given\" even if the person gives an answer which may be incorrect; their own perception of the person's ethnic background is recorded separately. Comparability of the information being recorded by officers was brought into question by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in September 2007, as part of its Equality Data Review; one problem cited was the number of reports that contained an ethnicity of \"<a4_0>Not Stated<a4_0/>.\""}
