It was thought that such <a2_0>large geographic distances<a2_0/> would maximize the genetic variation between the groups sampled in the analysis and thus maximize the probability of finding cluster patterns unique to each group. In light of the historically recent acceleration of human <a3_0>migration<a3_0/> (and correspondingly, human <a4_0>gene<a4_0/> flow) on a global scale, further studies were conducted to judge the degree to which genetic cluster analysis can pattern ancestrally identified groups as well as geographically separated groups. One such study looked at a large multiethnic population in the United States, and \"detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each race/ethnicity group. Thus, ancient geographic ancestry, which is highly correlated with self-identified race/ethnicity\u2014as opposed to current residence\u2014is the major determinant of genetic structure in the U.S. population.\" (Tang et al.
