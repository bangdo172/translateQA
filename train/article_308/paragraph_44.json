The criteria for membership in these races diverged <a2_0>in the late 19th century<a2_0/>. <a3_0>During Reconstruction<a3_0/>, increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with \"one drop\" of known \"Black blood\" to be Black, regardless of appearance.3 By the early 20th century, this notion was made statutory in many states.4 Amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of \"Indian blood\" (called blood quantum). To be White one had to have perceived \"pure\" White ancestry. The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known African ancestry. This rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible African ancestry were defined as black. <a4_0>The one-drop rule<a4_0/> is specific to not only those with African ancestry but to the United States, making it a particularly African-American experience."}
