Today, <a1_0>approximately five percent<a1_0/> of the French population is non-European and non-white. This does not approach the number of non-white citizens in the United States (<a2_0>roughly 28\u201337%<a2_0/>, depending on how Latinos are classified; see Demographics of the United States). Nevertheless, it amounts to at least three million people, and has forced the issues of <a3_0>ethnic diversity<a3_0/> onto the French policy agenda. France has developed an approach to dealing with ethnic problems that stands in contrast to that of many advanced, industrialized countries. Unlike the United States, Britain, or even the Netherlands, France maintains a \"<a4_0>color-blind<a4_0/>\" model of public policy. This means that it targets virtually no policies directly at racial or ethnic groups. Instead, it uses geographic or class criteria to address issues of social inequalities. It has, however, developed an extensive anti-racist policy repertoire since the early 1970s. Until recently, French policies focused primarily on issues of hate speech\u2014going much further than their American counterparts\u2014and relatively less on issues of discrimination in jobs, housing, and in provision of goods and services."}
