In the diverse geographic context of Europe, ethnicity and ethnic origin are arguably more resonant and are less encumbered by the ideological baggage associated with \"race\". In <a2_0>European<a2_0/> context, historical resonance of \"race\" underscores its problematic nature. In some states, it is strongly associated with laws promulgated by the Nazi and <a3_0>Fascist<a3_0/> governments in Europe during the 1930s and 1940s. Indeed, in <a4_0>1996<a4_0/>, the European Parliament adopted a resolution stating that \"the term should therefore be avoided in all official texts\"."}
