In the <a1_0>18th century<a1_0/> the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation. But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the <a2_0>White<a2_0/>, European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes. The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus, inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human race Homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus, asiaticus, americanus, and afer, each associated with a different humour: sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic, respectively. Homo sapiens europaeus was described as <a3_0>active, acute, and adventurous<a3_0/>, whereas Homo sapiens afer was said to be <a4_0>crafty, lazy, and careless<a4_0/>."}
