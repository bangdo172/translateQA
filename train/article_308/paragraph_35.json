One of the researchers, Neil Risch, noted: \"we looked at the correlation between genetic structure [based on microsatellite markers] versus <a2_0>self<a2_0/>-description, we found 99.9% concordance between the two. We actually had a higher discordance rate between self-reported sex and markers on the X chromosome! So you could argue that <a3_0>sex<a3_0/> is also a problematic category. And there are differences between sex and gender; self-identification may not be correlated with <a4_0>biology<a4_0/> perfectly. And there is sexism.\""}
