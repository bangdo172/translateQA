These types grade into each other <a1_0>like the colors of the spectrum<a1_0/>, and not one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred preferentially to <a2_0>appearance<a2_0/>, not heredity, and appearance is a poor indication of <a3_0>ancestry<a3_0/>, because only a few genes are responsible for someone's skin color and traits: a person who is considered white may have more African ancestry than a person who is considered black, and the reverse can be also true about European ancestry. The complexity of racial classifications in <a4_0>Brazil<a4_0/> reflects the extent of miscegenation in Brazilian society, a society that remains highly, but not strictly, stratified along color lines. These socioeconomic factors are also significant to the limits of racial lines, because a minority of pardos, or brown people, are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward, and being seen as relatively \"whiter\" as their perceived social status increases (much as in other regions of Latin America)."}
