The <a1_0>mid-20th-century anthropologist<a1_0/> William C. Boyd defined race as: \"A population which differs significantly from other populations in regard to the frequency of one or more of the <a2_0>genes<a2_0/> it possesses. It is an arbitrary matter which, and how many, gene loci we choose to consider as a significant 'constellation'\". Leonard Lieberman and Rodney Kirk have pointed out that \"the paramount weakness of this statement is that if one gene can distinguish races then the number of races is as numerous as the <a3_0>number of human couples reproducing<a3_0/>.\" Moreover, the anthropologist Stephen Molnar has suggested that the discordance of clines inevitably results in a multiplication of races that renders the concept itself useless. The Human Genome Project states \"People who have lived in the same geographic region for many generations may have some <a4_0>alleles<a4_0/> in common, but no allele will be found in all members of one population and in no members of any other.\""}
