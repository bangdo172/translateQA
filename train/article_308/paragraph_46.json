In a 2007 review paper, \u0160trkalj suggested that the stark contrast of the racial approach between the United States and China was due to the fact that race is a factor for <a2_0>social cohesion<a2_0/> among the ethnically diverse people of China, whereas \"race\" is a very <a3_0>sensitive issue<a3_0/> in America and the racial approach is considered to undermine social cohesion - with the result that in the socio-political context of US academics scientists are encouraged not to use <a4_0>racial categories<a4_0/>, whereas in China they are encouraged to use them."}
