(2007) have argued that even when individuals can be reliably assigned to specific population groups, it may still be possible for two randomly chosen individuals from different populations/clusters to be more similar to each other than to a randomly chosen member of their own <a0_0>cluster<a0_0/>. They found that many <a1_0>thousands<a1_0/> of genetic markers had to be used in order for the answer to the question \"How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?\" to be \"never\". This assumed three population groups separated by large geographic ranges (European, African and East Asian). The entire world population is much more complex and studying an increasing number of groups would require an increasing number of <a2_0>markers<a2_0/> for the same answer. The authors conclude that \"<a3_0>caution<a3_0/> should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes.\" Witherspoon, et al. concluded that, \"The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them. It is also compatible with our \ufb01nding that, even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used, individuals are frequently more similar to members of <a4_0>other populations<a4_0/> than to members of their own population.\""}
