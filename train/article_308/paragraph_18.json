Phylogenetic analysis relies on the concept of derived characteristics that are not shared between groups, usually applying to populations that are allopatric (<a1_0>geographically<a1_0/> separated) and therefore discretely bounded. This would make a subspecies, evolutionarily speaking, <a2_0>a clade<a2_0/> \u2013 a group with a common evolutionary ancestor population. The smooth gradation of human genetic variation in general tends to rule out any idea that human population groups can be considered <a3_0>monophyletic<a3_0/> (cleanly divided), as there appears to always have been considerable gene flow between human populations. <a4_0>Rachel Caspari<a4_0/> (2003) have argued that clades are by definition monophyletic groups (a taxon that includes all descendants of a given ancestor) and since no groups currently regarded as races are monophyletic, none of those groups can be clades."}
