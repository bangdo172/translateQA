According to this ideology, races are <a1_0>primordial, natural, enduring and distinct<a1_0/>. It was further argued that some groups may be the result of <a2_0>mixture between formerly distinct populations<a2_0/>, but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups. Subsequent influential classifications by Georges Buffon, Petrus Camper and Christoph Meiners all classified \"<a3_0>Negros<a3_0/>\" as inferior to Europeans. In the United States the racial theories of <a4_0>Thomas Jefferson<a4_0/> were influential. He saw Africans as inferior to Whites especially in regards to their intellect, and imbued with unnatural sexual appetites, but described Native Americans as equals to whites."}
