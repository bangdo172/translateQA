While assimilated Amerindians and people with very high quantities of Amerindian ancestry are usually grouped as <a1_0>caboclos<a1_0/>, a subgroup of pardos which roughly translates as both mestizo and <a2_0>hillbilly<a2_0/>, for those of lower quantity of Amerindian descent a higher European genetic contribution is expected to be grouped as a pardo.
