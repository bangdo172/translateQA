Today, the word \"Latino\" is often used as a synonym for \"<a1_0>Hispanic<a1_0/>\". The definitions of both terms are <a2_0>non-race specific<a2_0/>, and include people who consider themselves to be of distinct races (Black, White, Amerindian, Asian, and mixed groups). However, there is a common misconception in the US that Hispanic/Latino is a race or sometimes even that national origins such as Mexican, Cuban, Colombian, Salvadoran, etc. are <a3_0>races<a3_0/>. In contrast to \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\", \"Anglo\" refers to non-Hispanic White Americans or non-Hispanic European Americans, most of whom speak the English language but are not necessarily <a4_0>of English descent<a4_0/>."}
