They claim that \"the molecular and biochemical proponents of this model explicitly use racial categories in their initial grouping of samples\". For example, the large and highly diverse macroethnic groups of East Indians, North Africans, and Europeans are presumptively grouped as <a1_0>Caucasians<a1_0/> prior to the analysis of their DNA variation. This is claimed to limit and skew <a2_0>interpretations<a2_0/>, obscure other lineage relationships, deemphasize the impact of more immediate clinal environmental factors on genomic diversity, and can cloud our understanding of the true patterns of affinity. They argue that however significant the empirical research, these studies use the term race in <a3_0>conceptually imprecise and careless<a3_0/> ways. They suggest that the authors of these studies find support for racial distinctions only because they began by assuming the validity of race. \"For empirical reasons we prefer to place emphasis on clinal variation, which recognizes the existence of adaptive human hereditary variation and simultaneously stresses that such variation is not found in <a4_0>packages<a4_0/> that can be labeled races.\""}
