In the centre are <b5_0>the large Marktkirche<b5_0/> (Church St. Georgii et Jacobi, preaching venue of the bishop of the Lutheran Landeskirche Hannovers) and the Old Town Hall. Nearby are the Leibniz House, the Nolte House, and the Beguine Tower. A very nice quarter of the Old Town is the Kreuz-Church-Quarter around the Kreuz Church with many nice little lanes. Nearby is the old <b6_0>royal sports hall<b6_0/>, now called the <a1_0>Ballhof theatre<a1_0/>. On the edge of the Old Town are the Market Hall, the Leine Palace, and the ruin of the <a2_0><b7_0>Aegidien Church<b7_0/><a2_0/> which is now a monument to the victims of war and violence. Through the Marstall Gate you arrive at the bank of the river Leine, where the world-famous <a3_0>Nanas of Niki de Saint-Phalle<a3_0/> are located. They are part of <b8_0>the Mile of Sculptures<b8_0/>, which starts from <a4_0>Trammplatz<a4_0/>, leads along the river bank, crosses K\u00f6nigsworther Square, and ends at the entrance of the Georgengarten. Near the Old Town is the <b9_0>district of Calenberger Neustadt<b9_0/> where the Catholic Basilica Minor of St. Clemens, the Reformed Church and the Lutheran Neust\u00e4dter Hof- und Stadtkirche St. Johannis are located."}
