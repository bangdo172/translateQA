The German spelling (with <a0_0>a double n<a0_0/>) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling, and the local government uses the <a1_0>German<a1_0/> spelling on English websites. The English pronunciation /\u02c8h\u00e6n\u0259v\u0259r/, with stress on the <a2_0>first<a2_0/> syllable and a reduced second syllable, is applied to both the German and English spellings, which is different from German pronunciation [ha\u02c8no\u02d0f\u0250], with stress on the <a3_0>second<a3_0/> syllable and a long second vowel. The <a4_0>traditional English spelling<a4_0/> is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British House of Hanover."}
