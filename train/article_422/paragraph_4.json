Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children, and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline, usually from David. His mother, previously a member (with David) of the <a1_0>River Brethren<a1_0/> sect of the Mennonites, joined the International Bible Students Association, later known as <a2_0>Jehovah's Witnesses<a2_0/>. The Eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915, though Eisenhower never joined the International Bible Students. His later decision to attend <a3_0>West Point<a3_0/> saddened his mother, who felt that warfare was \"rather wicked,\" but she did not overrule him.

He was baptized in the <a4_0>Presbyterian<a4_0/> Church in 1953."}
