Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about Nixon's repeating as the Vice President on his ticket; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition. He personally favored <a3_0>Robert B. Anderson<a3_0/>, a Democrat, who rejected his offer; Eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party.

The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations."}
