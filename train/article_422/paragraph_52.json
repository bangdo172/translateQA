The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the <a0_0>refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections<a0_0/>. In talks located in <a1_0>London<a1_0/> that year, they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections; the tables were then turned on <a2_0>Eisenhower<a2_0/>, when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections. In May of that year the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to <a3_0>Austria<a3_0/>, and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the U.S., U.K. and France. At the Geneva Conference Eisenhower presented a proposal called \"<a4_0>Open Skies<a4_0/>\" to facilitate disarmament, which included plans for Russia and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure. Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand."}
