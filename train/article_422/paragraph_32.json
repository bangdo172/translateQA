His main role was rapid demobilization of <a1_0>millions<a1_0/> of soldiers, a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping. Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs. However, in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets, <a2_0>Truman<a2_0/> was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon. Indeed, Eisenhower had <a3_0>opposed<a3_0/> the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, \"First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.\" Initially, Eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the Soviets. He even visited <a4_0>Warsaw<a4_0/> in 1945. Invited by Boles\u0142aw Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city. However, by mid-1947, as East\u2013West tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated, Eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion."}
