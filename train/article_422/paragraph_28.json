Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his <a0_0>21st Army Group<a0_0/>'s attack being made in the north, while Generals <a1_0>Bradley<a1_0/> (12th U.S. Army Group) and <a2_0>Devers<a2_0/> (Sixth U.S. Army Group) insisted they be given priority in the center and <a3_0>south<a3_0/> of the front (respectively). Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces, often by giving them tactical, though sometimes ineffective, latitude; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe. However, due to Eisenhower's persistence, the pivotal supply port at <a4_0>Antwerp<a4_0/> was successfully, albeit belatedly, opened in late 1944, and victory became a more distinct probability."}
