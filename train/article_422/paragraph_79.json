Eventually after leaving the White House, he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks.

In August 1966 he began to show symptoms of <a1_0>cholecystitis<a1_0/>, for which he underwent surgery on December 12, 1966, when his <a2_0>gallbladder<a2_0/> was removed, containing 16 gallstones. After Eisenhower's death in <a3_0>1969<a3_0/> (see below), an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma, a benign adrenaline-secreting tumor that may have made the President more vulnerable to heart disease. Eisenhower suffered <a4_0>seven<a4_0/> heart attacks in total from 1955 until his death."}
