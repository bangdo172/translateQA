In January 1948, after learning of plans in <a0_0>New Hampshire<a0_0/> to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming Republican National Convention, Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was \"not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office\"; \"life-long professional soldiers\", he wrote, \"in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason, [should] abstain from seeking high political office\". Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time. Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president; Republican <a3_0>Thomas E. Dewey<a3_0/> was considered the other probable winner, would presumably serve two terms, and Eisenhower, at age <a1_0>66<a1_0/> in 1956, would then be <a2_0>too old<a2_0/>."}
