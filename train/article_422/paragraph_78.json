This incident occurred during a <a1_0>cabinet meeting<a1_0/> when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his <a2_0>right hand<a2_0/>. The stroke had caused an aphasia. The president also suffered from Crohn's disease, <a3_0>chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine<a3_0/>, which necessitated surgery for a <a4_0>bowel obstruction<a4_0/> on June 9, 1956. To treat the intestinal block, surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine. His scheduled meeting with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He was still recovering from this operation during the Suez Crisis. Eisenhower's health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits, but he still indulged in alcohol. During a visit to England he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29, 1959; however, before dinner at Chequers on the next day his doctor General Howard Snyder recalled Eisenhower \"drank several gin-and-tonics, and one or two gins on the rocks ... three or four wines with the dinner\"."}
