His primary objective was to move forces successfully into <a0_0>Tunisia<a0_0/>, and intending to facilitate that objective, he gave his support to <a1_0>Fran\u00e7ois Darlan<a1_0/> as High Commissioner in North Africa, despite Darlan's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces. The Allied leaders were \"thunderstruck\" by this from a political standpoint, though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation. Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move. Darlan was assassinated on <a4_0>December 24<a4_0/> by <a2_0>Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle<a2_0/>. Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies, considering it a criminal rather than a military matter. Eisenhower later appointed General <a3_0>Henri Giraud<a3_0/> as High Commissioner, who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan's commander-in-chief, and who had refused to postpone the execution."}
