Believing that a general should not participate in politics, one author later wrote that \"figuratively speaking, [Eisenhower] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office\". As others asked him about his political future, Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job \"from dogcatcher to <a1_0>Grand High Supreme King of the Universe<a1_0/>\", and another that he could not serve as <a2_0>Army Chief of Staff<a2_0/> if others believed he had political ambitions. In 1945 Truman told Eisenhower during the <a4_0>Potsdam Conference<a4_0/> that if desired, the president would help the general win the 1948 election, and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower's running mate on the Democratic ticket if <a3_0>MacArthur<a3_0/> won the Republican nomination."}
