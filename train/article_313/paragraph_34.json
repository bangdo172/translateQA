Powerful women both wisely and unwisely wielded power at various occasions. After Ashikaga Yoshimasa, <a0_0>8th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate<a0_0/>, <a2_0>lost interest in politics<a2_0/>, his wife <a1_0>Hino Tomiko<a1_0/> largely ruled in his place. Nene, <a3_0>wife of <a4_0>Toyotomi Hideyoshi<a4_0/><a3_0/>, was known to overrule her husband's decisions at times and Yodo-dono, his concubine, became the de facto master of Osaka castle and the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi's death. Tachibana Ginchiyo was chosen to lead the Tachibana clan after her father's death. Chiyo, wife of Yamauchi Kazutoyo, has long been considered the ideal samurai wife. According to legend, she made her kimono out of a quilted patchwork of bits of old cloth and saved pennies to buy her husband a magnificent horse, on which he rode to many victories. The fact that Chiyo (though she is better known as \"Wife of Yamauchi Kazutoyo\") is held in such high esteem for her economic sense is illuminating in the light of the fact that she never produced an heir and the Yamauchi clan was succeeded by Kazutoyo's younger brother. The source of power for women may have been that samurai left their finances to their wives."}
