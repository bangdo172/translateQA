In Japanese, it was originally recorded in the Nara Period as a verb *samorapu (\"<a1_0>to watch, to keep watch, to observe, to be on the lookout for something; to serve, to attend<a1_0/>\"), which is believed to be derived from the frequentative form (*morapu \u5b88\u3089\u3075) of the verb moru (\u5b88\u308b, \"to watch, to guard, to be on the lookout; to keep, to protect, to take care of, to be in charge of, to have as one's ward\"). By the Heian period, this word had developed into the verb saburahu (\u3055\u3076\u3089\u3075, \"<a2_0>to serve, to attend<a2_0/>\"), from which a deverbal noun saburahi (\u3055\u3076\u3089\u3072, \"<a3_0>servant, attendant<a3_0/>\") was later derived, and this noun then yielded samurahi (\u3055\u3080\u3089\u3072) in <a4_0>the Edo period<a4_0/>.
