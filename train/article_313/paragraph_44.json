Samurai were usually loyal to their immediate superiors, who in turn allied themselves with higher lords. These loyalties to the higher lords often shifted; for example, the high lords allied under Toyotomi Hideyoshi (\u8c4a\u81e3\u79c0\u5409) were served by loyal samurai, but the feudal lords under them could shift their support to <a2_0>Tokugawa<a2_0/>, taking their samurai with them. There were, however, also notable instances where samurai would be disloyal to their lord or daimyo, when <a3_0>loyalty to the Emperor was seen to have supremacy<a3_0/>."}
