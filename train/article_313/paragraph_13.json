With no warfare since <a1_0>the early 17th century<a1_0/>, samurai gradually lost their military function during the Tokugawa era (also called <a2_0>the Edo period<a2_0/>). By the end of the Tokugawa era, samurai were aristocratic bureaucrats for the daimyo, with their daisho, the paired long and short swords of the samurai (cf. <a3_0>katana<a3_0/> and <a4_0>wakizashi<a4_0/>) becoming more of a symbolic emblem of power rather than a weapon used in daily life. They still had the legal right to cut down any commoner who did not show proper respect kiri-sute gomen (\u65ac\u308a\u6368\u3066\u5fa1\u514d?), but to what extent this right was used is unknown.
