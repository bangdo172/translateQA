Most commanders who did opposed or otherwise resisted/resented Hideyoshi ended up as part of the so-called <a1_0>Eastern Army<a1_0/>, while commanders loyal to Hideyoshi and his son (a notable exception to this trend was <a2_0>Kat\u014d Kiyomasa<a2_0/>, who deployed with Tokugawa and the Eastern Army) were largely committed to the Western Army; the two opposing sides (so named for the relative geographical locations of their respective commanders' domains) would later clash, most notably at the <a3_0>Battle of Sekigahara<a3_0/>, which was won by Tokugawa Ieyasu and the <a4_0>Eastern Forces<a4_0/>, paving the way for the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate."}
