The programs typically feature a samurai. Samurai films and westerns share a number of similarities and the two have influenced each other over the years. <a1_0>One of Japan\u2019s most renowned directors<a1_0/>, <a2_0>Akira Kurosawa<a2_0/>, greatly influenced the samurai aspect in western film-making.[citation needed] George Lucas\u2019 Star Wars series incorporated many aspects from the <a3_0>Seven Samurai<a3_0/> film. One example is that in the Japanese film, seven samurai warriors are hired by local farmers to protect their land from being overrun by bandits; In George Lucas\u2019 Star Wars: A New Hope, a similar situation arises. Kurosawa was inspired by the works of director John Ford and in turn Kurosawa's works have been remade into westerns such as The Seven Samurai into <a4_0>The Magnificent Seven<a4_0/> and Yojimbo into A Fistful of Dollars. There is also a 26 episode anime adaptation (Samurai 7) of The Seven Samurai. Along with film, literature containing samurai influences are seen as well."}
