Skilled in mounted combat and archery (ky\u016bd\u014d), these clan warriors became the Emperor's preferred tool for putting down rebellions.[citation needed] Though this is the first known use of the \"Shogun\" title, it was a temporary title, and was not imbued with political power until the 13th century. At this time (the 7th to 9th century) the Imperial Court officials considered them merely a military section under the control of the Imperial Court."}
