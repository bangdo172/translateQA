The <a2_0><b7_0>gaseous diffusion<b7_0/><a2_0/> process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the Manhattan Project. In this process, <a3_0><b8_0>uranium hexafluoride<b8_0/><a3_0/> is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium 238 is <a4_0><b9_0>heavier<b9_0/><a4_0/> it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers. Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion."}
