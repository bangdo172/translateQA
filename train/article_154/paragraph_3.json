Uranium is the <a0_0><b4_0>51st<b4_0/><a0_0/> element in order of abundance in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements. Along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron, it is only naturally formed <a1_0><b5_0>in supernovae<b5_0/><a1_0/>. The decay of uranium, <a2_0><b6_0>thorium<b6_0/><a2_0/>, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core <a3_0><b7_0><b8_0>liquid<b8_0/><b7_0/><a3_0/> and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics."}
