This leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess <a1_0><b5_0>carbonate<b5_0/><a1_0/> at alkaline pH. A <a2_0><b6_0><b7_0>Sphingomonas sp.<b7_0/><b6_0/><a2_0/> strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli."}
