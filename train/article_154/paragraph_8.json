While the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water), <a1_0><b5_0>uranium<b5_0/><a1_0/> carbonates are often soluble in water. This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form <a2_0><b6_0><b7_0>anionic complexes<b7_0/><b6_0/><a2_0/>."}
