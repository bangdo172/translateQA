Other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into <a1_0><b6_0>two<b6_0/><a1_0/> smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) <a2_0><b7_0>an explosion<b7_0/><a2_0/>. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a <a3_0><b8_0>neutron poison<b8_0/><a3_0/>, absorbing some of the <a4_0><b9_0>free neutrons<b9_0/><a4_0/>. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control)."}
