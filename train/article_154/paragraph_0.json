While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as <a1_0><b6_0>radium<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as <a2_0><b7_0>ballast<b7_0/><a2_0/> for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its <a3_0><b8_0>high density<b8_0/><a3_0/>, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a <a4_0><b9_0>weak<b9_0/><a4_0/> alpha emitter)."}
