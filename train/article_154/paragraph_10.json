All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: <a2_0><b7_0>uranium-239<b7_0/><a2_0/>, which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; <a3_0><b8_0>uranium-233<b8_0/><a3_0/>, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-236 and -240, which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244. It is also expected that <a4_0><b9_0>thorium-232<b9_0/><a4_0/> should be able to undergo double beta decay, which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally."}
