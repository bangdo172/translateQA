The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, people who work in factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The <a0_0><b5_0>Occupational Safety and Health Administration<b5_0/><a0_0/> (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as <a1_0><b6_0>0.25 mg/m3<b6_0/><a1_0/> over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a <a2_0><b7_0>recommended exposure limit<b7_0/><a2_0/> (REL) of <a3_0><b8_0>0.2 mg/m3<b8_0/><a3_0/> over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6 mg/m3. At levels of <a4_0><b9_0>10 mg/m3<b9_0/><a4_0/>, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health."}
