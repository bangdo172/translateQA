Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given <a2_0><b7_0>glycerol phosphate<b7_0/><a2_0/> (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water. The proteobacterium <a3_0><b8_0>Geobacter<b8_0/><a3_0/> has also been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground water. The mycorrhizal fungus <a4_0><b9_0>Glomus intraradices<b9_0/><a4_0/> increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant."}
