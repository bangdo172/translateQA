Both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions. <a1_0><b4_0>Triuranium octoxide<b4_0/><a1_0/> is (depending on conditions) the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature. <a2_0><b5_0>Uranium dioxide<b5_0/><a2_0/> is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel. At ambient temperatures, UO\n2 will gradually convert to U\n3O\n8. Because of their stability, uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal."}
