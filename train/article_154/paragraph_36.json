The ore deposit is <a2_0><b7_0>1.7 billion years<a2_0/> old<b7_0/>; then, uranium-235 constituted about <a3_0><b8_0>3%<b8_0/><a3_0/> of the total uranium on Earth. This is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur, provided other supporting conditions exist. The capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the U.S. federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the <a4_0><b9_0>Yucca Mountain<b9_0/><a4_0/> nuclear waste repository."}
