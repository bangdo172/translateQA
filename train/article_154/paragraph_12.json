Another fissile isotope, <a2_0><b7_0>uranium-233<b7_0/><a2_0/>, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree <a3_0><b8_0>uranium-233<b8_0/><a3_0/> have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. <a4_0><b9_0>Depleted uranium<b9_0/><a4_0/> (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating."}
