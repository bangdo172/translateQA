Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from <b6_0>uranium-<a1_0>238<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (<a3_0><b8_0>thermonuclear weapon<b8_0/><a3_0/>) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and <a2_0><b7_0>deuterium<b7_0/><a2_0/> to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile <b9_0>(<a4_0>unenriched<b9_0/><a4_0/>) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process."}
