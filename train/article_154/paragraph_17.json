It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography. The 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to <a1_0><b6_0>Martin Heinrich Klaproth<b6_0/><a1_0/>, who named the new element after the planet Uranus. <a2_0><b7_0>Eug\u00e8ne-Melchior P\u00e9ligot<b7_0/><a2_0/> was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by <a3_0><b8_0>Henri Becquerel<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi and others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in <a4_0><b9_0>Little Boy<b9_0/><a4_0/>, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety. See Nuclear proliferation."}
