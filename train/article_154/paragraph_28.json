Carbides of uranium include uranium monocarbide (UC), uranium dicarbide (UC\n2), and <a0_0><b2_0>diuranium tricarbide<b2_0/><a0_0/> (U\n2C\n3). Both UC and UC\n2 are formed by adding carbon to molten uranium or by exposing the metal to carbon monoxide at high temperatures. Stable below <a1_0><b3_0>1800 \u00b0C<b3_0/><a1_0/>, U\n2C\n3 is prepared by subjecting a heated mixture of UC and UC\n2 to mechanical stress. Uranium nitrides obtained by direct exposure of the metal to nitrogen include uranium mononitride (UN), uranium dinitride (UN\n2), and diuranium trinitride (U\n2N\n3)."}
