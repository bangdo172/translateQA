The fission products were at first mistaken for new elements of atomic numbers 93 and 94, which the <a3_0><b8_0>Dean of the Faculty of Rome<a3_0/>,<b8_0/> Orso Mario Corbino, christened ausonium and <a2_0><b7_0>hesperium<b7_0/><a2_0/>, respectively. The experiments leading to the discovery of uranium's ability to fission (break apart) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Hahn's laboratory in Berlin. <a4_0><b9_0>Lise Meitner<b9_0/><a4_0/> and her nephew, the physicist Otto Robert Frisch, published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process \"nuclear fission\". Soon after, Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction. Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939, and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235. Further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium, which, like uranium-235, is also fissile by thermal neutrons. These discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power."}
