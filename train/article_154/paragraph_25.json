The most common ionic forms are U3+ (brown-red), U4+ (<a0_0><b4_0>green<b4_0/><a0_0/>), UO+\n2 (unstable), and UO2+\n2 (yellow), for U(III), U(IV), U(V), and U(VI), respectively. A few solid and semi-metallic compounds such as UO and US exist for the formal oxidation state uranium(II), but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state. Ions of U3+ liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable. The UO2+\n2 ion represents the <a1_0><b5_0>uranium(VI)<b5_0/><a1_0/> state and is known to form compounds such as <a2_0><b6_0>uranyl carbonate<b6_0/><a2_0/>, uranyl chloride and uranyl sulfate. UO2+\n2 also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents, the most commonly encountered of which is <a3_0><b7_0>uranyl acetate<b7_0/><a3_0/>."}
