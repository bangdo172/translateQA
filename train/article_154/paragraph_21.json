Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains <a0_0><b5_0>0.01 to 0.25%<b5_0/><a0_0/> uranium oxides. Extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in <a3_0><b8_0>Saskatchewan<b8_0/><a3_0/>, <a2_0><b7_0>Canada<b7_0/><a2_0/> can contain up to <a4_0><b9_0>23%<b9_0/><a4_0/> uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion."}
