In Italy, Spain, Portugal and Poland, the encyclical was welcomed. In Latin America, much support developed for the Pope and his encyclical. As World Bank President <a0_0>Robert McNamara<a0_0/> declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting <a1_0>birth control<a1_0/> practices would get preferential access to resources, doctors in La Paz, <a2_0>Bolivia<a2_0/> called it insulting that money should be exchanged for the conscience of a Catholic nation. In <a4_0>Colombia<a4_0/>, <a3_0>Cardinal archbishop An\u00edbal Mu\u00f1oz Duque<a3_0/> declared, if American conditionality undermines Papal teachings, we prefer not to receive one cent. The Senate of Bolivia passed a resolution stating that Humanae vitae could be discussed in its implications for individual consciences, but was of greatest significance because the papal document defended the rights of developing nations to determine their own population policies. The Jesuit Journal Sic dedicated one edition to the encyclical with supportive contributions."}
