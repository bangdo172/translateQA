During the pontificate of Pius XII, the Vatican eased regulations on the use of <a0_0>Latin<a0_0/> in Roman Catholic liturgies, permitting some use of vernacular languages during baptisms, funerals and other events. In 1951 and 1955, the <a1_0>Easter liturgies<a1_0/> underwent revision, most notably including the reintroduction of the <a2_0>Easter Triduum<a2_0/>. The Second Vatican Council made no changes to the Roman Missal, but in the document Sacrosanctum Concilium mandated that a general revision of it take place. After the Vatican Council, in April 1969, Paul VI approved the \"new Order of <a3_0>Mass<a3_0/>\" promulgated in 1970, as stated in the Acta Apostolica Sedis to \"end experimentation\" with the Mass and which included the introduction of <a4_0>three<a4_0/> new Eucharistic Prayers to what was up to then a single Roman Canon."}
