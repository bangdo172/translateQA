In his 1976 consistory, <a0_0>five<a0_0/> of twenty cardinals originated from Africa, one of them a son of a tribal chief with fifty wives. Several prominent Latin Americans like Eduardo Francisco Pironio of <a1_0>Argentina<a1_0/>; Luis Aponte Martinez of Puerto Rico and Eug\u00eanio de Ara\u00fajo Sales and Aloisio Lorscheider from <a2_0>Brazil<a2_0/> were also elevated by him. There were voices within the Church at the time saying that the European period of the Church was coming to a close, a view shared by Britain's Cardinal Basil Hume. At the same time, the members of the College of Cardinals lost some of their previous influences, after Paul VI decreed, that not only cardinals but also bishops too may participate in committees of the <a3_0>Roman Curia<a3_0/>. The age limit of eighty years imposed by the Pope, a numerical increase of Cardinals by almost 100%, and a reform of the <a4_0>regal vestments<a4_0/> of the \"Princes of the Church\" further contributed to a service-oriented perception of Cardinals under his pontificate. The increased number of Cardinals from the Third World and the papal emphasis on related issues was nevertheless welcomed by many in Western Europe."}
