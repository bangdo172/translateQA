Published by his order in January <a0_0>1976<a0_0/> was a homily Persona Humana: Declaration on Certain Questions concerning Sexual Ethics, which outlawed pre or extra-marital sex, condemned homosexuality, and forbade masturbation. It provoked French author and former diplomat <a2_0>Roger Peyrefitte<a2_0/>, in an interview published by the magazine Tempo, to accuse Montini of hypocrisy, and of having a longtime lover who was a movie actor. According to rumors prevalent both inside the Curia and in Italian society, this was <a3_0>Paolo Carlini<a3_0/>, who had a bit part as a hairdresser in the Audrey Hepburn film Roman Holiday. Peyrefitte had previously published the accusation in two books, but the interview (previously published in a French gay magazine) brought the rumors to a wider public and caused an uproar. In a brief address to a crowd of approximately 20,000 in St. Peters Square on <a4_0>April 18<a4_0/>, Montini called the charges \"horrible and slanderous insinuations\" and appealed for prayers on his behalf. Special prayers for Montini were said in all Italian Roman Catholic churches in \"a day of consolation\". In 1984 a New York Times correspondent repeated the allegations."}
