However, the industry's self-censorship board, the <a3_0><b7_0>Comics Code Authority<b7_0/><a3_0/>, refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics, deeming the context of the story irrelevant.

The market reacted well to the storyline, and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year."}
