Once again, Marvel attempted to <b6_0>diversify<b6_0/>, and with <a0_0><b5_0>the updating of the Comics Code<b5_0/><a0_0/> achieved moderate to strong success with titles themed to horror (<b9_0>The Tomb of Dracula<b9_0/>), martial arts, (Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu), sword-and-sorcery (<a1_0>Conan the Barbarian, Red Sonja<a1_0/>), satire (<a2_0>Howard the Duck<a2_0/>) and science fiction (2001: A Space Odyssey, \"Killraven\" in Amazing Adventures, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, and, late in the decade, the long-running Star Wars series). Some of these were published in <a4_0>larger-format black and white magazines, under its Curtis Magazines imprint<a4_0/>. Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line. Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in <a3_0><b7_0>1972<b7_0/><a3_0/>, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux. Goodman increased the price and size of Marvel's November 1971 cover-dated comics from <b8_0>15 cents<b8_0/> for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages. DC followed suit, but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages, offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount."}
