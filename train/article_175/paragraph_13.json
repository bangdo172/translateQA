However, a 2007 investigation by The Los Angeles Times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundation's allocation of aid. First, sub-Saharan Africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the Gates Foundation, but \"by pouring most contributions into the fight against such high-profile killers as AIDS, <a2_0><b8_0>Gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained, higher-paid clinicians, diverting staff from basic care<b8_0/>\" in sub-Saharan Africa<a2_0/>. This \"brain drain\" adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers. Second, <a3_0>\"the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged <b6_0>basic needs such as nutrition and transportation<b6_0/><a3_0/>\".
