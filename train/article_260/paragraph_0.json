On the other hand, in some places the court named the \"Supreme Court\" is not in fact the highest court; examples include the New York Supreme Court, <a3_0>the Supreme Courts of several Canadian provinces/territories<a3_0/> and the former <b7_0>Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales<b7_0/>, which are all superseded by higher Courts of Appeal."}
