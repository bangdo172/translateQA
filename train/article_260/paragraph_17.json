This can be attributed to the fact that the Philippines was colonized by both Spain and the <b6_0>United States<b6_0/>, and the system of laws of both nations strongly influenced the development of Philippine laws and jurisprudence. Even as the body of Philippine laws remain mostly codified, the Philippine Civil Code expressly recognizes that decisions of the Supreme Court <b8_0>\"form part of the law of the land\"<b8_0/>, belonging to the same class as statutes. The <a2_0>1987 <b7_0>Philippine Constitution<b7_0/><a2_0/> also explicitly grants to the Supreme Court the power of judicial review over laws and executive actions. The Supreme Court is composed of <a3_0>1 Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices<a3_0/>.
