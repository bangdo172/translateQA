It is the highest judicial instance. The Supreme Court sits <b5_0>in <a0_0>Jerusalem<b5_0/><a0_0/>. The area of its jurisdiction is the entire State. A ruling of the Supreme Court is binding upon every court, other than the Supreme Court itself. The Israeli supreme court is <a1_0>both an appellate court and the high court of justice<a1_0/>. As an appellate court, the Supreme Court considers cases on appeal (<b6_0>both criminal and civil<b6_0/>) on judgments and other decisions of the District Courts. It also considers appeals on judicial and quasi-judicial decisions of various kinds, such as matters relating to the legality of Knesset elections and disciplinary rulings of the Bar Association. As the High Court of Justice (Hebrew: Beit Mishpat Gavoha Le'Zedek \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8 \u05d2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7; also known by its initials as Bagatz \u05d1\u05d2\"\u05e5), the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, primarily in matters regarding the legality of decisions of State authorities: Government decisions, those of local authorities and other bodies and persons performing public functions under the law, and direct challenges to the constitutionality of laws enacted by <a2_0>the Knesset<a2_0/>. The court has broad discretionary authority to rule on matters in which it considers it necessary to grant relief in the interests of justice, and which are not within the jurisdiction of another court or tribunal. The High Court of Justice grants <b7_0>relief through orders such as injunction, mandamus and Habeas Corpus, as well as through declaratory judgments<b7_0/>. The Supreme Court can also sit at a further hearing on its own judgment. In a matter on which the Supreme Court has ruled - whether as a court of appeals or as the High Court of Justice - with <a3_0>a panel of three or more justices<a3_0/>, it may rule at a further hearing with a panel of a larger number of justices. A further hearing may be held if the Supreme Court makes a ruling inconsistent with a previous ruling or if the Court deems that the importance, difficulty or novelty of a ruling of the Court justifies such hearing. The Supreme Court also holds the unique power of being able to order <a4_0>\"trial de novo\"<a4_0/> (<b8_0>a retrial<b8_0/>)."}
