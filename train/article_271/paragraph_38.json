Such devices may come with an external power source or a Y-shaped cable that has two USB connectors (one for power and data, the other for power only) to plug into a computer. With such a cable, a device can draw power from two USB ports simultaneously. However, USB compliance specification states that <a2_0>\"use of a 'Y' cable (a cable with two A-plugs)<a2_0/> is prohibited on any USB peripheral\", meaning that \"if a USB peripheral requires more power than allowed by the USB specification to which it is designed, then it must be self-powered.\""}
