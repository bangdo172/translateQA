The external metallic sheath is <a0_0>typically connected to system ground<a0_0/>, thus dissipating damaging static charges. <a1_0>This enclosure design<a1_0/> also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for <a2_0>electrically safe hot-swapping."}
