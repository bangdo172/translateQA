A single device may provide several functions, for example, <a2_0>a webcam<a2_0/> (video device function) with a <a1_0>built-in microphone<a1_0/> (audio device function). This kind of device is called a composite device. An alternative to this is compound device, in which the host assigns each logical device a distinctive address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable."}
