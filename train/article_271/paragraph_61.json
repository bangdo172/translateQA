Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire 400 is faster than <a3_0>USB 2.0 Hi-Bandwidth in real-use<a3_0/>, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard-drives. The newer FireWire 800 standard is twice as fast as FireWire 400 and faster than USB 2.0 Hi-Bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, Firewire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack."}
