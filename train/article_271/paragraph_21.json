For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no logic circuitry may be used: the hardware in the USB keyboard or mouse is designed to detect <a1_0>whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port<a1_0/>, and communicate using the <a2_0>appropriate protocol<a2_0/>. <a3_0>Converters<a3_0/> also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port. These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use <a4_0>a microcontroller<a4_0/> to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards."}
