The new mode's logo features a \"Superspeed+\" caption (stylized as SUPERSPEED+). The USB 3.1 standard increases <a3_0>the data signaling rate to 10 Gbit/s in the USB 3.1 Gen2 mode<a3_0/>, double that of USB 3.0 (referred to as USB 3.1 Gen1) and reduces line encoding overhead to just 3% by changing the encoding scheme to 128b/132b. The first USB 3.1 implementation demonstrated transfer speeds of 7.2 Gbit/s."}
