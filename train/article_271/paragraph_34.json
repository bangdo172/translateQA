The OTG device with the B-plug inserted is called the <a0_0>B-device<a0_0/> and by default assumes the role of peripheral. An OTG device with no plug inserted defaults <a1_0>to acting as a B-device<a1_0/>. If an application on the B-device requires the role of host, then the Host Negotiation Protocol (HNP) is used to temporarily transfer the host role to the B-device."}
