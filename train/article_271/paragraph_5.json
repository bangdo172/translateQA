Microsoft Windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for the devices. The first widely used version of <a3_0>USB<a3_0/> was 1.1, which was released in <a4_0>September 1998<a4_0/>. The 12 Mbit/s data rate was intended for higher-speed devices such as disk drives, and the lower 1.5 Mbit/s rate for low data rate devices such as joysticks. Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself. Following Apple's design decision to remove all legacy ports from the iMac, many PC manufacturers began building legacy-free PCs, which led to the broader PC market using USB as a standard."}
