(<a2_0>Improved mini-B connectors<a2_0/> have reached 5,000-cycle lifetimes.) <a3_0>Micro connectors<a3_0/> were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind; not only is design lifetime of the connector improved to 10,000 cycles, but it was also redesigned to place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the more durable rigid contacts are located in the micro-USB receptacles. Likewise, the springy part of the retention mechanism (parts that provide required gripping force) were also moved into plugs on the cable side."}
