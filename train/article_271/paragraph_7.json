Additionally, there is a Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2 \u2013 December 2010), which <a2_0>increases the power handling capability to 1.5 A<a2_0/> but <a3_0>does not allow concurrent data transmission<a3_0/>. The Battery Charging Specification requires that the physical ports themselves be capable of handling 5 A of current[citation needed] but limits the maximum current drawn to 1.5 A."}
