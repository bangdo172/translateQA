USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals <a0_0>closely associated with a host computer<a0_0/>, and in fact it connects <a1_0>the peripheral and host grounds<a1_0/>. This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions."}
