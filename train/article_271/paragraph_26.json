Features intended to accomplish include, a locking device was added and the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to the plug, so that the most-stressed part is <a2_0>on the cable side of the connection<a2_0/>. This change was made <a3_0>so that the connector on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear<a3_0/> instead of the more expensive micro-USB device. However the idea that these changes did in fact make the connector more durable in real world use has been widely disputed, with many contending that they are in fact, much less durable."}
