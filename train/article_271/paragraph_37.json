A device may draw a maximum of <a2_0>five unit loads<a2_0/> from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or <a3_0>six unit loads<a3_0/> in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits. Every device functions initially as low-power (including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases), but may request high-power, and get it if available on the providing bus."}
