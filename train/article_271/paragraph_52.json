After this, the transmitter ceases to drive the D+/D\u2212 lines and the aforementioned pull up resistors hold it in the J (idle) state. Sometimes skew due to hubs can add <a1_0>as much as one bit time before the SE0 of the end of packet<a1_0/>. This extra bit can also result in a <a2_0>\"bit stuff violation<a2_0/>\" if the six bits before it in the CRC are 1s. This bit should be ignored by receiver."}
