Such devices can use <a1_0>an external power supply<a1_0/>, which is allowed by the standard, or use <a2_0>a dual-input USB cable<a2_0/>, <a3_0>one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power<a3_0/>, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this."}
