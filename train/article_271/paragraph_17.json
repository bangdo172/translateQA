This was at first intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and has been extended to support flash drives. It has also been extended to support a wide variety of novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as <a2_0>extension<a2_0/>. The ability to boot a write-locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for <a3_0>maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium."}
