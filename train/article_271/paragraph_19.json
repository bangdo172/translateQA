These offer <a1_0>performance comparable to internal drives<a1_0/>, limited by the current number and types of attached USB devices, and by the upper limit of the USB interface (in practice about 30 MB/s for USB 2.0 and potentially 400 MB/s or more for USB 3.0). These external drives typically include <a3_0>a \"translating device\"<a3_0/> that bridges between a drive's interface to a USB interface port. Functionally, the drive appears to the user much like an internal drive. Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include eSATA, ExpressCard, FireWire (IEEE 1394), and most recently <a2_0>Thunderbolt<a2_0/>."}
