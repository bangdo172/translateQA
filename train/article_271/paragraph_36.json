The primary reason for this limit is the maximum allowed round-trip delay of about 1.5 \u03bcs. If USB host commands are unanswered by the USB device within the allowed time, the host considers the command lost. When adding USB device response time, delays from the maximum number of hubs added to the delays from connecting cables, the maximum acceptable delay per cable amounts to <a1_0>26 ns<a1_0/>. The USB 2.0 specification requires that <a2_0>cable delay be less than 5.2 ns per meter<a2_0/> (192 000 km/s, which is close to the maximum achievable transmission speed for standard copper wire)."}
