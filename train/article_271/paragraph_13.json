A pipe is <a0_0>a connection from the host controller to a logical entity<a0_0/>, found on a device, and named <a2_0>an endpoint<a2_0/>. Because pipes correspond <a3_0>1-to-1 to endpoints<a3_0/>, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A USB device could have <a4_0>up to 32 endpoints<a4_0/> (16 IN, 16 OUT), though it's rare to have so many. An endpoint is defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called \"enumeration\") and so is relatively permanent, whereas a pipe may be opened and closed."}
