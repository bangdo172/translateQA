This prevents users <a2_0>from accidentally connecting two USB power supplies to each other<a2_0/>, which could lead to short circuits and dangerously high currents, circuit failures, or even fire. USB does not support <a3_0>cyclic networks<a3_0/> and the standard connectors from incompatible USB devices are themselves incompatible."}
