It also has optional DRM features. MTP was designed for <a2_0>use with portable media players<a2_0/>, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary reason for this is that <a3_0>MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does<a3_0/>, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems."}
