A data packet must always be preceded by <a1_0>an address token<a1_0/>, and is usually followed by <a2_0>a handshake token from the receiver back to the transmitter<a2_0/>. The two packet types provide the 1-bit sequence number required by Stop-and-wait ARQ. If a USB host does not receive a response (such as an ACK) for data it has transmitted, it does not know if the data was received or not; the data might have been lost in transit, or it might have been received but the handshake response was lost."}
