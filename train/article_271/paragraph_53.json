A device that is HS capable first connects as <a2_0>an FS device (D+ pulled high)<a2_0/>, but upon receiving a USB RESET (both D+ and D\u2212 driven LOW by host for 10 to 20 ms) it pulls the D\u2212 line high, known as chirp K. This indicates to the host that the device is high bandwidth. If the host/hub is also HS capable, it chirps (returns alternating J and K states on D\u2212 and D+ lines) letting the device know that the hub operates at high bandwidth. The device has to receive at least three sets of KJ chirps before it changes to high bandwidth terminations and begins high bandwidth signaling. Because USB 3.0 uses wiring separate and additional to that used by USB 2.0 and USB 1.x, such bandwidth negotiation is not required."}
