The USB specification states that the required USB icon must be <a1_0>embossed on the \"topside\" of the USB plug<a1_0/>, which \"...provides easy user recognition and facilitates alignment during the mating process.\" The specification also shows that the \"recommended\" \"Manufacturer's logo\" (\"engraved\" on the diagram but not specified in the text) is on the opposite side of the USB icon. The specification further states, \"The USB Icon is also located <a2_0>adjacent<a2_0/> to each receptacle. Receptacles should be oriented to allow the icon on the plug <a3_0>to be visible during the mating process<a3_0/>.\" However, the specification does not consider the height of the device compared to the eye level height of the user, so the side of the cable that is \"visible\" when mated to a computer on a desk can depend on whether the user is standing or kneeling."}
