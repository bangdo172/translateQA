This kind of design was chosen <a1_0>to prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment<a1_0/>, as only the Type-A socket provides power. There are cables with Type-A connectors on both ends, but they should be used carefully. Therefore, in general, each of the different \"sizes\" requires four different connectors; USB cables have the Type-A and Type-B plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computer or electronic device.
