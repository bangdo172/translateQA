In addition to its extensive collections of <a1_0>American Art, European Art and ancient art,<a1_0/> the museum recently has hosted major exhibitions featuring <b6_0>Auguste Rodin<b6_0/> (in <a2_0>2000<a2_0/>) and Claude Monet (in 2006-07), each attracting more than <a3_0><b7_0>200,000<b7_0/><a3_0/> visitors. Unlike most prominent public museums, the North Carolina Museum of Art acquired a large number of the works in its permanent collection through purchases with <a4_0>public funds<a4_0/>. The museum's outdoor park is one of the largest such art parks in the country. The museum facility underwent a major expansion which greatly expanded the exhibit space that was completed in <b8_0>2010<b8_0/>. The 127,000 sf new expansion is designed by NYC architect <b9_0>Thomas Phifer<b9_0/> and Partners."}
