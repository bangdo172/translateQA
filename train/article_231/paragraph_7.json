They were unsuccessful. In 1900, <a2_0>the state legislature passed a new constitution<a2_0/>, with voter registration rules that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by <a3_0>1908<a3_0/>. Loss of the ability to vote disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office, local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive. It was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the <a4_0>mid-<b8_0>1960s<b8_0/><a4_0/> that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. No African American was elected to Congress until 1992."}
