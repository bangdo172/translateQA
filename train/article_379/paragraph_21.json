The myth of Danaus, whose origin is <a1_0><b6_0>Egypt<b6_0/><a1_0/>, is a foundation legend of Argos. <a2_0>His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to <b7_0>carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom<b7_0/><a2_0/>. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: \"river\". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The <a3_0>Denyen<a3_0/> seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia. Pottery similar to that of Mycenae itself has been found in Tarsus of Cilicia and it seems that some refugees from the Aegean went there after the collapse of the Mycenean civilization. These Cilicians seem to have been called Dananiyim, the same word as Danaoi who attacked Egypt in 1191 BC along with the Quaouash (or Weshesh) who may be Achaeans. They were also called Danuna according to a Hittite inscription and the same name is mentioned in the Amarna letters. Julius Pokorny reconstructs the name from the PIE root da:-: \"flow, river\", da:-nu: \"any moving liquid, drops\", da: navo \"people living by the river, Skyth. nomadic people (in Rigveda water-demons, fem.Da:nu primordial goddess), in Greek Danaoi, Egypt. Danuna\". It is also possible that the name Danaans is pre-Greek. <a4_0>A country Danaja with a city Mukana (propaply: Mycenea) is mentioned in <b8_0>inscriptions from Egypt<b8_0/><a4_0/> from Amenophis III (1390-1352 BC), Thutmosis III (1437 BC)."}
