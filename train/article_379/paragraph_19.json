He also claims that the great deluge must have occurred in the region around Dodona, where the Selloi dwelt. However, according to the Greek tradition it is more possible that the homeland of the Greeks was originally in central Greece. <a2_0>A modern theory derives the name Greek (Latin Graeci) from Graikos, \"<b6_0>inhabitant of Graia/Graea<b6_0/>,\" a town on the coast of Boeotia.<a2_0/> Greek colonists from Graia helped to found Cumae (900 BC) in Italy, where they were called Graeces. When the Romans encountered them they used this name for the colonists and then for all Greeks (Graeci.) The <a3_0>word <b7_0>\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1 graia \"old woman\" comes from the PIE root *\u01f5erh2-/*\u01f5reh2-, \"to grow old\"<b7_0/> via Proto-Greek *gera-/grau-iu<a3_0/>; the same root later gave \u03b3\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 geras (/keras/), \"gift of honour\" in Mycenean Greek. The Germanic languages borrowed the word Greeks with an initial \"k\" sound which probably was their initial sound closest to the Latin \"g\" at the time (Goth. Kreks). The area out of ancient Attica including Boeotia was called Gra\u00efke and is connected with the older deluge of Ogyges, the mythological ruler of Boeotia. The region was originally occupied by the Minyans who were autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people. In ancient Greek the name Ogygios came to mean \"from earliest days\"."}
