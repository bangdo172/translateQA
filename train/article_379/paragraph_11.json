The <a3_0><b8_0>interest in the Classical Greek heritage<b8_0/> was complemented by a renewed emphasis on Greek Orthodox identity<a3_0/>, which was reinforced in the late Medieval and Ottoman Greeks' links with their fellow Orthodox Christians in the Russian Empire. These were further strengthened following the fall of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461, after which and until the <a4_0><b9_0>second Russo-Turkish War<b9_0/><a4_0/> of 1828-29 hundreds of thousands of Pontic Greeks fled or migrated from the Pontic Alps and Armenian Highlands to southern Russia and the Russian South Caucasus (see also Greeks in Russia, Greeks in Armenia, Greeks in Georgia, and Caucasian Greeks)."}
