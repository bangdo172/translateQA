The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (\u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af). In Greek mythology, <a1_0><b6_0>Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes<b6_0/><a1_0/>, <a2_0>was son of <b7_0>Pyrrha and Deucalion<b7_0/>, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge.<a2_0/> It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin. Aristotle names ancient Hellas as an area in Epirus between Dodona and the Achelous river, the location of the great deluge of Deucalion, a land occupied by the Selloi and the \"Greeks\" who later came to be known as \"Hellenes\". Selloi were the priests of Dodonian Zeus and the word probably means \"sacrificers\" (compare Gothic saljan, \"present, sacrifice\"). There is currently no satisfactory etymology of the name Hellenes. Some scholars assert that the name Selloi changed to Sellanes and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However this etymology connects the name Hellenes with the Dorians who occupied Epirus and the relation with the name Greeks given by the Romans becomes uncertain. <a3_0>The name Hellenes seems to be older and it was probably used by the Greeks with the establishment of the Great Amphictyonic League.<a3_0/> This was an ancient association of Greek tribes <a4_0>with <b8_0>twelve founders<b8_0/><a4_0/> which was organized to protect the great temples of Apollo in Delphi (Phocis) and of Demeter near Thermopylae (Locris). According to the legend it was founded after the Trojan War by the eponymous Amphictyon, brother of Hellen."}
