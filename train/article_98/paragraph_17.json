Immediately after the legislation passed, the owners of the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel began converting it into the <a1_0><a2_0>Resorts International<a2_0/><a1_0/>. It was the first legal casino in the eastern United States when it opened on May 26, <a3_0>1978<a3_0/>. Other casinos were soon constructed along the Boardwalk and, later, in the marina district for a total of <a4_0>eleven<a4_0/> today. The introduction of gambling did not, however, quickly eliminate many of the urban problems that plagued Atlantic City. Many people have suggested that it only served to exacerbate those problems, as attested to by the stark contrast between tourism intensive areas and the adjacent impoverished working-class neighborhoods. In addition, Atlantic City has been less popular than Las Vegas, as a gambling city in the United States. Donald Trump helped bring big name boxing bouts to the city to attract customers to his casinos. The boxer Mike Tyson had most of his fights in Atlantic City in the 1980s, which helped Atlantic City achieve nationwide attention as a gambling resort. Numerous highrise condominiums were built for use as permanent residences or second homes. By end of the decade it was one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States."}
