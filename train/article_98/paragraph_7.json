The hotel was a hit and, in 1905\u201306, he chose to expand the hotel and bought another parcel of land next door to his Marlborough House. In an effort to make his new hotel a source of conversation, White hired the architectural firm of Price and McLanahan. The firm made use of reinforced concrete, a new building material invented by Jean-Louis Lambot in <a3_0>1848<a3_0/> (Joseph Monier received the patent in 1867). The hotel's Spanish and Moorish themes, capped off with its signature dome and chimneys, represented a step forward from other hotels that had a classically designed influence. White named the new hotel the <a4_0>Blenheim<a4_0/> and merged the two hotels into the Marlborough-Blenheim. Bally's Atlantic City was later constructed at this location."}
