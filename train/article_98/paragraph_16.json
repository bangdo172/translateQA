Prior to and during the advent of legalized gaming, many of these hotels were <a1_0>demolished<a1_0/>. The Breakers, the Chelsea, the Brighton, the Shelburne, the Mayflower, the Traymore, and the Marlborough-Blenheim were demolished in the <a2_0>1970s and 1980s<a2_0/>. Of the many pre-casino resorts that bordered the boardwalk, only the Claridge, the Dennis, the Ritz-Carlton, and the Haddon Hall survive to this day as parts of Bally's Atlantic City, a condo complex, and Resorts Atlantic City. The old Ambassador Hotel was purchased by <a4_0>Ramada<a4_0/> in 1978 and was gutted to become the <a3_0>Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City<a3_0/>, only reusing the steelwork of the original building. Smaller hotels off the boardwalk, such as the Madison also survived."}
