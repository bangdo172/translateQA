During Prohibition, which was enacted nationally in <a1_0>1919<a1_0/> and lasted <a4_0>until 1933<a4_0/>, much liquor was consumed and gambling regularly took place in the back rooms of nightclubs and restaurants. It was during Prohibition that racketeer and political boss Enoch L. \"Nucky\" Johnson rose to power. Prohibition was largely unenforced in Atlantic City, and, because alcohol that had been smuggled into the city with the acquiescence of local officials could be readily obtained at restaurants and other establishments, the resort's popularity grew further. The city then dubbed itself as \"<a2_0>The World's Playground<a2_0/>\". Nucky Johnson's income, which reached <a3_0>as much as $500,000 annually<a3_0/>, came from the kickbacks he took on illegal liquor, gambling and prostitution operating in the city, as well as from kickbacks on construction projects."}
