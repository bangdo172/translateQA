The neighborhood known as <a0_0>the \"Inlet\"<a0_0/> became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort's decline were multi-layered. First of all, the <a3_0>automobile<a3_0/> became more readily available to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had initially relied upon visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks. The car allowed them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a few days, rather than weeks. Also, the advent of suburbia played a huge role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as <a4_0>home air conditioning and swimming pools<a4_0/> diminished their interest in flocking to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer. But perhaps the biggest factor in the decline in Atlantic City's popularity came from <a1_0>cheap, fast jet service<a1_0/> to other premier resorts, such as <a2_0>Miami Beach and the Bahamas<a2_0/>."}
