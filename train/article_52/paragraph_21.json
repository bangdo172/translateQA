The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of inter-system interference, especially within <a2_0><a3_0>E1 and E2<a3_0/><a2_0/> bands, which are allocated for Galileo's publicly regulated service. However, under International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, <a4_0>the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency<a4_0/> will have priority to that frequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation's broadcasts. It now appears that <b6_0><b7_0>Chinese<b7_0/><b6_0/> COMPASS satellites will start transmitting in the E1, E2, E5B, and E6 bands before Europe's Galileo satellites and thus have primary rights to these frequency ranges."}
