The fifth orbiter was launched into space from Xichang Satellite Launch Center by an LM-3I carrier rocket on 1 <b5_0>August<b5_0/> 2010. Three months later, on 1 <b8_0>November<b8_0/> 2010, the sixth satellite was sent into orbit by LM-3C. Another satellite, the Beidou-2/Compass IGSO-5 (fifth inclined geosynchonous orbit) satellite, was launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center by a Long March-3A on 1 December 2011 (UTC)."}
