Plants and other photosynthetic organisms are at the base of most food chains because they use the <a0_0>energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil<a0_0/> and atmosphere, converting them into a form that can be used by animals. This is what ecologists call the <a1_0>first trophic level<a1_0/>. The modern forms of the major staple foods, such as maize, rice, wheat and other cereal grasses, pulses, bananas and plantains, as well as flax and cotton grown for their fibres, are the outcome of prehistoric selection over thousands of years from among wild ancestral plants with the most desirable characteristics. Botanists study how plants produce food and how to increase yields, for example through <a2_0>plant breeding<a2_0/>, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable <a3_0>problem in agriculture<a3_0/>, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems. Ethnobotany is the study of the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant\u2013people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany."}
