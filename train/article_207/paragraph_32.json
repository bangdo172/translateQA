One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by DNA methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not. Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and <a2_0>prevent that region of the DNA code<a2_0/> from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the <a3_0>differences<a3_0/> between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes <a4_0>may be temporary<a4_0/> or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life. Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be heritable, while others are reset in the germ cells."}
