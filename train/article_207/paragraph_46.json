The order is: <a0_0>Kingdom<a0_0/>; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); <a1_0>Species<a1_0/>. The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a <a2_0>single world-wide name<a2_0/> for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination is the name of the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in <a3_0>the genus<a3_0/> and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily <a4_0>italicised<a4_0/> (or underlined when italics are not available)."}
