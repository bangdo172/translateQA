The energy of <a1_0>sunlight<a1_0/>, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular respiration, is the basis of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them <a2_0>in the construction of cells and tissues<a2_0/>. Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the <a3_0>opposite of photosynthesis<a3_0/>."}
