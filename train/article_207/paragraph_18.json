Their energy is used in the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme rubisco to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the <a1_0>first product of photosynthesis<a1_0/> and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesized. Some of the glucose is converted to <a2_0>starch<a2_0/> which is stored in the chloroplast. Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while inulin, a polymer of <a3_0>fructose<a3_0/> is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family Asteraceae. Some of the glucose is converted to sucrose (common table sugar) <a4_0>for export to the rest of the plant<a4_0/>."}
