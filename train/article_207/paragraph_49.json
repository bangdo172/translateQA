The difference is that the <a2_0>genetic code itself is used<a2_0/> to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. Clive Stace describes this as having \"direct access to the genetic basis of evolution.\" As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals. Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below \u2013 fungi are more <a3_0>closely related to animals<a3_0/> than to plants."}
