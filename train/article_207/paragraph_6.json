The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (<a1_0>diagnostic keys<a1_0/>) or more closely related to the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from <a2_0>newly discovered countries<a2_0/> and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linn\u00e9 (Carl Linnaeus) published his <a3_0>Species Plantarum<a3_0/>, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the <a4_0>number of their male sexual organs<a4_0/>. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi."}
