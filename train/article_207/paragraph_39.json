Darwin experimented on the <a2_0>movements of plant shoots<a2_0/> and roots towards light and gravity, and concluded \"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle . . acts like <a1_0>the brain of one of the lower animals<a1_0/> . . directing the several movements\". About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which <a3_0>promotes cell growth<a3_0/>, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to <a4_0>form roots and shoots<a4_0/> by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification."}
