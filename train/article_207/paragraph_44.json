Leaves <a1_0>gather sunlight<a1_0/> and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called <a4_0>foliage leaves<a4_0/>. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing <a2_0>plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds<a2_0/>. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are <a3_0>woody plants<a3_0/>. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means."}
