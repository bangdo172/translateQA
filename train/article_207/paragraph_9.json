Raunki\u00e6r whose system for describing plant life forms is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, <a2_0>Arthur Tansley<a2_0/> and Frederic Clements. Clements is credited with the idea of <a1_0>climax vegetation<a1_0/> as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology. Building on the extensive earlier work of <a3_0>Alphonse de Candolle<a3_0/>, Nikolai Vavilov (1887\u20131943) produced accounts of the biogeography, centres of origin, and evolutionary <a4_0>history of economic plants<a4_0/>."}
