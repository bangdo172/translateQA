Subcellular transport of ions, electrons and molecules such as water and enzymes occurs across cell membranes. Minerals and water are transported <a0_0>from roots<a0_0/> to other parts of the plant in the transpiration stream. Diffusion, osmosis, and active transport and mass flow are all different ways transport can occur. Examples of elements that plants need to transport are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulphur. In vascular plants, these elements are extracted from the soil <a1_0>as soluble ions<a1_0/> by the roots and transported throughout the plant in the xylem. Most of the elements required for plant nutrition come from the <a2_0>chemical breakdown of soil<a2_0/> minerals. Sucrose produced by photosynthesis is transported from <a3_0>the leaves<a3_0/> to other parts of the plant in the phloem and plant hormones are transported <a4_0>by a variety of processes<a4_0/>."}
