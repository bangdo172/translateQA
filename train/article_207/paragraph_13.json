Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out <a1_0>photosynthesis<a1_0/>, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of <a2_0>organic molecules<a2_0/> that are used in the structural components of cells. As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release <a3_0>oxygen<a3_0/> into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing <a4_0>soil erosion<a4_0/>. Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil."}
