During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilized egg cell, <a1_0>the zygote<a1_0/>, gives rise to the many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it <a2_0>continues to divide<a2_0/>. The process results from the epigenetic <a3_0>activation of some genes and inhibition of others<a3_0/>."}
