A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha \u00d7 piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of <a1_0>wheat<a1_0/> are the result of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the <a2_0>pollen either fails to reach the stigma<a2_0/> or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by <a3_0>separate individuals<a3_0/>. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes."}
