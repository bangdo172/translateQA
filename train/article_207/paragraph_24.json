For example, <a0_0>plant phenology<a0_0/> can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical climatology, and the biological impact of climate change and global warming. Palynology, the analysis of <a1_0>fossil pollen deposits in sediments<a1_0/> from thousands or millions of years ago allows the reconstruction of past climates. Estimates of atmospheric <a2_0>CO2<a2_0/> concentrations since the Palaeozoic have been obtained from stomatal densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants. <a3_0>Ozone depletion<a3_0/> can expose plants to <a4_0>higher levels of ultraviolet radiation-B<a4_0/> (UV-B), resulting in lower growth rates. Moreover, information from studies of community ecology, plant systematics, and taxonomy is essential to understanding vegetation change, habitat destruction and species extinction."}
