Furthermore, it emphasizes structural dynamics. Modern systematics aims to reflect and discover <a0_0>phylogenetic<a0_0/> relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on <a1_0>DNA sequences<a1_0/> as data. <a2_0>Molecular analysis of DNA<a2_0/> sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering many of the questions about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research."}
