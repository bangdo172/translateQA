Adanson (1763), de Jussieu (1789), and Candolle (<a1_0>1819<a1_0/>) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The Candollean system reflected his ideas of the progression of <a2_0>morphological complexity<a2_0/> and the later classification by Bentham and Hooker, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species in 1859 and his <a3_0>concept of common descent<a3_0/> required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity."}
