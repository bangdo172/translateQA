Ideally, these organisms have <a0_0>small genomes<a0_0/> that are well known or completely sequenced, small stature and short generation times. <a3_0>Corn<a3_0/> has been used to study mechanisms of <a1_0>photosynthesis<a1_0/> and phloem loading of sugar in C4 plants. The single celled green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, while not an embryophyte itself, contains a green-pigmented chloroplast related to that of land plants, making it useful for study. A <a2_0>red alga<a2_0/> Cyanidioschyzon merolae has also been used to study some basic chloroplast functions. Spinach, peas, soybeans and a moss Physcomitrella patens are commonly used to study plant cell biology."}
