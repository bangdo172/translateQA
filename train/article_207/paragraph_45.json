It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to <a0_0>shared physical characteristics<a0_0/>. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent \u2013 grouping organisms <a1_0>by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics<a1_0/>. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses <a2_0>DNA sequences<a2_0/> as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the <a3_0>International Botanical Congress."}
