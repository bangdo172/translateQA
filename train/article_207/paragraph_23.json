For example, they can change their environment's albedo, increase runoff interception, stabilize mineral soils and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants compete with other organisms in their ecosystem <a1_0>for resources<a1_0/>. They interact with their neighbours at a variety of spatial scales in groups, populations and communities that collectively constitute <a2_0>vegetation<a2_0/>.
