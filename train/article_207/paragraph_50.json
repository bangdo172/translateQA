As a result of this work, many questions, such as <a3_0>which families represent the earliest branches<a3_0/> of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of <a1_0>evolution in plants<a1_0/>. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have <a2_0>greatly increased the level of detail<a2_0/> studied and speed at which data can be analysed."}
