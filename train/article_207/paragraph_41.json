All plants are multicellular eukaryotes, their DNA stored <a3_0>in nuclei<a3_0/>. The characteristic features of plant cells that distinguish them from those of animals and fungi include a <a2_0>primary cell wall composed of the polysaccharides cellulose<a2_0/>, hemicellulose and pectin,  <a4_0>larger<a4_0/> vacuoles than in animal cells and the presence of plastids with unique photosynthetic and biosynthetic functions as in the chloroplasts. Other plastids contain storage products such as starch (amyloplasts) or lipids (elaioplasts). Uniquely, streptophyte cells and those of the green algal order Trentepohliales divide by construction of a phragmoplast as a template for building a cell plate late in cell division."}
