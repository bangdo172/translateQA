Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on <a1_0>shared inheritance<a1_0/> to determine relationships. As an example, species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless cactus such as an Echinocactus. However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have <a2_0>spines produced from areoles<a2_0/> (highly specialised <a3_0>pad-like structures<a3_0/>) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related."}
