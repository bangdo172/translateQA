The shoots consist of <a0_0>stems bearing green photosynthesising leaves<a0_0/> and reproductive structures. The underground vascularised roots bear root hairs at their tips and <a1_0>generally lack chlorophyll<a1_0/>. Non-vascular plants, the liverworts, hornworts and mosses <a2_0>do not produce ground-penetrating vascular roots<a2_0/> and <a3_0>most of the plant<a3_0/> participates in photosynthesis.
