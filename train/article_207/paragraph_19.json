Vascular land plants make <a0_0>lignin<a0_0/>, a polymer used to strengthen the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels to keep them from collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under <a1_0>water stress<a1_0/>. <a4_0>Lignin<a4_0/> is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibers that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. <a3_0>Sporopollenin<a3_0/> is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period. The concentration of <a2_0>carbon dioxide<a2_0/> in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods. Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae have since independently evolved pathways like Crassulacean acid metabolism and the C4 carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from photorespiration in the more common C3 carbon fixation pathway. These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants."}
