Apizza is baked in coal- or wood-fired brick ovens, and is notable for <a7_0>its thin crust<a7_0/>. Apizza may be red (with a tomato-based sauce) or white (with a sauce of garlic and olive oil), and pies ordered \"plain\" are made without the otherwise customary <a3_0>mozzarella cheese<a3_0/> (originally smoked mozzarella, known as \"scamorza\" in Italian). A white clam pie is a well-known specialty of the restaurants on <a8_0>Wooster Street in the <a4_0>Little Italy<a4_0/> section<a8_0/> of New Haven, including Pepe's and Sally's Apizza (which opened in 1938). Modern Apizza on State Street, which opened in 1934, is also well-known."}
