The city could be argued to have some of the first preconceived layouts in the country. Upon founding, New Haven was laid out in a <a0_0>grid plan of <a8_0>nine square blocks<a8_0/><a0_0/>; the central square was left open, in the tradition of many New England towns, as the city green (a commons area). The city also instituted the first <a1_0><a9_0>public tree planting program<a9_0/><a1_0/> in America. As in other cities, many of the elms that gave New Haven the nickname <a2_0>\"<a5_0>Elm City\"<a5_0/><a2_0/> perished in the mid-20th century due to <a3_0>Dutch Elm disease<a3_0/>, although many have since been replanted. The <a4_0><a6_0>New Haven Green<a6_0/><a4_0/> is currently home to three separate historic churches which speak to the original theocratic nature of the city. The Green remains the social center of the city today. It was named a National Historic Landmark in <a7_0>1970<a7_0/>."}
