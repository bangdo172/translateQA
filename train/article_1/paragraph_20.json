In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the <a2_0>Salle Pleyel<a2_0/>, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons, but preferred playing at <a0_0>his own Paris <a6_0>apartment<a6_0/> for small groups of friends<a0_0/>. The musicologist Arthur Hedley has observed that \"As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances\u2014few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime.\" The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, <a7_0>Liszt and Hiller<a7_0/> performed (on <a1_0>pianos<a1_0/>) a concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil <a5_0>Adolphe Gutmann<a5_0/>, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's <a3_0>Hexameron<a3_0/>; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with <a4_0><a8_0>Maurice Schlesinger<a8_0/><a4_0/>, who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England."}
