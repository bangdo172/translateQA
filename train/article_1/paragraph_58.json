However, with the exception of his <a1_0>Funeral March<a1_0/>, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary \u00c9tude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his <a2_0>Sonata No. 2<a2_0/> (Op. 35), the <a3_0>one<a3_0/> case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it."}
