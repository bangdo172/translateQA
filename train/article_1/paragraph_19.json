A genius.\" On <a1_0><a5_0>26 February 1832<a5_0/><a1_0/> Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The critic Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: \"Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...\" After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially <a2_0>intimate <a8_0>keyboard technique<a8_0/><a2_0/> was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy <a6_0>Rothschild<a6_0/> banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon <a3_0>his father<a3_0/>, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from <a9_0>publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students<a9_0/> from all over Europe. This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked."}
