Intolerance of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds and non-orthodox Muslim sects, such as Sufis, Shi'a and Ahmadis, also remains a problem. When the government moved to computerise identification cards, members of <a1_0>religious minorities<a1_0/>, such as Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, could not obtain identification documents. An Egyptian court ruled in early <a2_0>2008<a2_0/> that members of other faiths may obtain identity cards without listing their faiths, and without becoming officially recognised."}
