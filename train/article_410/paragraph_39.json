Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about <a1_0>600,000 tonnes<a1_0/> (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons) per year. Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions, the Gulf of Suez, and the Nile Delta. Egypt has huge reserves of gas, estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres (520 cu mi), and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries. In 2013, the Egyptian General Petroleum Co (EGPC) said the country will <a3_0>cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis<a3_0/> and stave off political unrest, Reuters has reported. Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas (LNG) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer, while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand, said EGPC chairman, Tarek El Barkatawy. Egypt produces its own energy, but <a2_0>has been a net oil importer since 2008<a2_0/> and is rapidly becoming a net importer of natural gas."}
