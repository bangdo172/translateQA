Before that deadline, CBC's licence renewal process would take place and CBC's digital transition plans would be examined as part of that process. The requirement remains for all of CBC's full-power transmitters occupying channels <a2_0><b6_0>52 to 69<b6_0/><a2_0/> to either relocate to channels <a1_0><b5_0>2 to 51<b5_0/><a1_0/> or become low-power transmitters. In some cases, CBC has opted to reduce the power of existing transmitters to low-power transmitters, which will result in signal loss for some viewers."}
