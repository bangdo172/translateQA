CBC O&O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like <a0_0><b5_0>Toronto's CBLT<b5_0/><a0_0/>, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP). All CBC O&O stations have a <b8_0>standard call letter naming convention<b8_0/>, in that the first two letters are <a2_0>\"CB\"<a2_0/> (an ITU prefix allocated not to Canada, but to Chile) and the last letter is <a3_0>\"T\"<a3_0/>. Only the third letter varies from market to market; however, that letter is typically the same as the third letter of the CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 stations in the same market. An exception to this rule are the <a4_0>CBC North<a4_0/> stations in Yellowknife, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, whose call signs begin with \"CF\" due to their historic association with the CBC's Frontier Coverage Package prior to the advent of <b7_0>microwave and satellite broadcasting<b7_0/>."}
