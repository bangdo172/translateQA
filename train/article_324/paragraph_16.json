Due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation, the corporation published digital transition plans for none of its analogue retransmitters in mandatory markets to be converted to digital by the deadline. Under this plan, communities that receive analogue signals by rebroadcast transmitters in mandatory markets would lose their over-the-air signals as of the deadline. Rebroadcast transmitters account for <b6_0>23 of the 48<b6_0/> CBC and Radio-Canada transmitters in mandatory markets. Mandatory markets losing both CBC and Radio-Canada over-the-air signals include <a2_0><b5_0>London, Ontario (metropolitan area population 457,000) and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (metro area population 257,000)<b5_0/><a2_0/>. In both of those markets, the corporation's television transmitters are the only ones that were not planned to be converted to digital by the deadline."}
