One private CBC affiliate, <a0_0>CHBC-TV in Kelowna<a0_0/>, joined E! (then known as CH) on <b5_0>February 27<b5_0/>, 2006. When a private CBC affiliate reaffiliates with another network, the CBC has normally added a retransmitter of its nearest O&O station to ensure that CBC service is continued. However, due to an agreement between CHBC and <a1_0><b6_0>CFJC-TV in Kamloops<b6_0/><a1_0/>, CFJC also disaffiliated from the CBC on February 27, 2006, but no retransmitters were installed in the licence area. Former private CBC affiliates <a2_0>CKPG-TV Prince George and CHAT-TV Medicine Hat<a2_0/> disaffiliated on August 31, 2008 and joined E!, but the CBC announced it will not add new retransmitters to these areas. Incidentally, CFJC, CKPG and CHAT are all owned by an independent media company, <a3_0><b7_0>Jim Pattison Group<b7_0/><a3_0/>. With the closure of E! and other <b8_0>changes in the media landscape<b8_0/>, several former CBC affiliates have since joined City or Global, or closed altogether."}
