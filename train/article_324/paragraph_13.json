Incidentally, that was also the date for analogue to digital transition in Canada. Given recent practice and the CBC's decision not to convert any retransmitters to digital, even in markets with populations in the hundreds in thousands, it is not expected that the CBC will open new transmitters to replace its affiliates, and indeed may pare back its existing transmitter network. However, in March 2011, <b6_0>CKPR<b6_0/> announced that it had come to a programming agreement with the CBC, in which the station will continue to provide CBC programming in Thunder Bay for a period of <a2_0>five<a2_0/> years. On March 16, 2012, Astral Media announced the sale of its assets to <a3_0>Bell Media<a3_0/>, owners of CTV and CTV Two, for <b7_0>$3.38 billion<b7_0/> with CFTK and CJDC included in the acquisition. Whether the stations will remain CBC affiliates or become owned-and-operated stations of CTV or CTV Two following the completion of the merger is undetermined."}
