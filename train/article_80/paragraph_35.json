Other rivers such as the Danube have major tributaries flowing into them that originate in <a1_0>the Alps<a1_0/>. <a2_0>The Rhone<a2_0/> is second to the Nile as a freshwater source to the Mediterranean Sea; the river begins as <a3_0>glacial meltwater<a3_0/>, flows into Lake Geneva, and from there to France where one of its uses is to cool nuclear power plants. The Rhine originates in <a4_0>a 30 square kilometre area in Switzerland<a4_0/> and represents almost 60 percent of water exported from the country. Tributary valleys, some of which are complicated, channel water to the main valleys which can experience flooding during the snow melt season when rapid runoff causes debris torrents and swollen rivers."}
