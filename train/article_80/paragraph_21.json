The bottom nappe structure is of <a1_0>continental Europe<a1_0/>an origin, above which are stacked marine sediment nappes, topped off by nappes derived from <a2_0>the African plate<a2_0/>. <a3_0>The Matterhorn<a3_0/> is an example of the ongoing orogeny and shows evidence of great folding. The tip of the mountain consists of gneisses from the African plate; the base of the peak, below the glaciated area, consists of European basement rock. The sequence of Tethyan marine sediments and their oceanic basement is sandwiched between rock derived from the African and European plates."}
