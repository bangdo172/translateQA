The butterflies tend to be large, such as those from the swallowtail Parnassius family, with a habitat that ranges to <a2_0>1,800 m (5,906 ft)<a2_0/>. Twelve species of beetles have habitats up to the snow line; the most beautiful and formerly collected for its colours but now protected is the <a3_0>Rosalia alpina<a3_0/>. Spiders, such as the large wolf spider, live above the snow line and can be seen as high as 400 m (1,312 ft). Scorpions can be found in the Italian Alps."}
