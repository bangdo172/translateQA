This causes erosion and the formation of valleys over time. <a0_0>The Inn valley<a0_0/> is an example of a valley carved by glaciers during the ice ages with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion. <a1_0>Eroded rocks from the most recent ice age<a1_0/> lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of <a2_0>erosion from earlier ice ages<a2_0/>. Glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls (reliefs); valleys with lower reliefs and talus slopes are remnants of glacial troughs or previously infilled valleys. Moraines, <a3_0>piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier<a3_0/>, accumulate <a4_0>at edges, center and the terminus of glaciers."}
