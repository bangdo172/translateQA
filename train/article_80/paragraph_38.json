Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the polar regions have been called <a1_0>Alpine<a1_0/>. <a2_0>A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere<a2_0/> causes the temperature to decrease (see adiabatic lapse rate). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain. <a3_0>The height of the Alps<a3_0/> is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks."}
