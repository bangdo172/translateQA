In the <b3_0><b4_0>TMP<b4_0/><b3_0/> process, wood is chipped and then fed into large steam heated refiners, where the chips are squeezed and converted to fibres between two steel discs. In the <b8_0>groundwood<b8_0/> process, <a1_0><b5_0><b9_0>debarked logs<b9_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/> are fed into <b6_0>grinders<b6_0/> where they are pressed against <b7_0>rotating stones<b7_0/> to be made into fibres. Mechanical pulping does not remove the lignin, so the yield is very high, >95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time. Mechanical pulps have rather short fibres, thus producing <a2_0><b10_0>weak<b10_0/><a2_0/> paper. Although large amounts of electrical energy are required to produce mechanical pulp, it costs less than the chemical kind."}
