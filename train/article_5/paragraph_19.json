The production faced opposition from a variety of <b9_0>special interest<b9_0/> groups and <b10_0>city<b10_0/> authorities, who were concerned about the potential for damage to historical sites around the city, and problems with graffiti and rubbish appearing in the film. A car chase scene set along the banks of the <b11_0>Tiber<b11_0/> River and through the streets of Rome featured an <a6_0>Aston Martin DB10 and a <a2_0>Jaguar<a2_0/> C-X75<a6_0/>. The C-X75 was originally developed as a hybrid electric vehicle with <a3_0>four<a3_0/> independent electric engines powered by two jet turbines, before the project was cancelled. The version used for filming was converted to use a conventional internal combustion engine, to minimise the potential for disruption from mechanical problems with the complex hybrid system. The C-X75s used for filming were developed by the engineering division of Formula One racing team <a1_0><a7_0>Williams<a7_0/><a1_0/>, who built the original C-X75 prototype for <a8_0>Jaguar."}
