They travel by <a0_0>train<a0_0/> to the nearest station, but are once again confronted by Hinx; they engage in a fight throughout the train in which Mr Hinx is eventually thrown off the train by Bond with Swann's assistance. After arriving at the station, Bond and Swann are escorted to Oberhauser's base. There, he reveals that <b5_0>Spectre<b5_0/> has been staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return <b6_0>Spectre<b6_0/> will be given unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes. Bond is tortured as <b4_0><b7_0>Oberhauser<b7_0/><b4_0/> discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father, <a1_0>Hannes<a1_0/>, became his temporary guardian. Believing that <b8_0>Bond<b8_0/> supplanted his role as son, Oberhauser killed his father and staged his own death, subsequently adopting the name <a2_0><a3_0>Ernst Stavro Blofeld<a3_0/><a2_0/> and going on to form Spectre. Bond and Swann escape, destroying the base in the process, leaving Blofeld to apparently die during the explosion."}
