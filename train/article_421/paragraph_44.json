The religion has been criticized for its \"two witness rule\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at <b7_0>Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17<b7_0/>, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \"the elders will leave the matter in <a1_0>Jehovah's<a1_0/> hands\". A former member of the church\u2019s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, \"which is an impossibility\". Anderson says the policies \"<b9_0>protect <a2_0><b6_0>pedophiles<b6_0/><a2_0/> rather than protect the <a3_0>children<b9_0/><a3_0/>.\" Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children, adding that the best way to protect children is by <b8_0>educating parents<b8_0/>; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate <a4_0>children from parents<a4_0/>."}
