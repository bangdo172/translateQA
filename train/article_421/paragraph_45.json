The Watch Tower Society's policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so, but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family. The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the Jehovah's Witnesses within their organization since <b7_0><b8_0>1950<b8_0/><b7_0/>, \"<a1_0><b5_0>not one<b5_0/><a1_0/> was reported by the church to secular authorities.\" William Bowen, a former Jehovah's Witness elder who established the Silentlambs organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion, has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities, and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order <a2_0>to protect its \"crime-free\" reputation<a2_0/>. In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been <a3_0>negligent<a3_0/> in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court, reportedly paying <a4_0>as much as <b6_0><b9_0>$780,000<b9_0/><b6_0/> to one plaintiff<a4_0/> without admitting wrongdoing."}
