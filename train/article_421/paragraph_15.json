The Governing Body does not issue any single, comprehensive \"statement of faith\", but prefers to express its doctrinal position in a variety of ways <a2_0>through publications published by the Watch Tower Society<a2_0/>. Their publications teach that doctrinal changes and refinements result from a process of progressive revelation, in which God <a3_0>gradually<a3_0/> reveals his will and purpose, and that such enlightenment or \"new light\" results from the application of reason and study, the guidance of the holy spirit, and direction from Jesus Christ and angels. The Society also teaches that members of the <b5_0><b8_0>Governing Body<b8_0/><b5_0/> are helped by the holy spirit to discern \"deep truths\", which are then considered by the entire Governing Body before it makes doctrinal decisions.
