This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing. The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment. Occasionally the airways themselves change. Typical changes in the airways include <a2_0><b7_0>an increase in eosinophils and thickening of the lamina reticularis<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Chronically <b8_0>the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands<b8_0/>.
