In <b6_0>1998<b6_0/>, Aerosmith released the number one hit <a0_0>\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\"<a0_0/>, which remains the only single by a hard rock band to debut at number one. AC/DC produced the double platinum <a1_0><b7_0>Ballbreaker<b7_0/><a1_0/> (1995). Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as \"Keep the Faith\" (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the Top 10 ballads \"Bed of Roses\" (1993) and \"Always\" (1994). Bon Jovi's 1995 album <a2_0><b8_0>These Days<b8_0/><a2_0/> was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four Top 10 singles on the UK Singles Chart. Metallica's Load (1996) and ReLoad (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, <b9_0>post-grunge bands<b9_0/> emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia's Silverchair and England's Bush, who all cemented <a3_0>post-grunge<a3_0/> as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or \"pop-metal\" sound."}
