Also significant was <b8_0>Black Sabbath<b8_0/>'s <a3_0>Paranoid<a3_0/> (<b9_0>1970<b9_0/>), which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the <a2_0>occult and elements of Gothic horror<a2_0/>. All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal, but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music, with bands like <a4_0>Judas Priest<a4_0/> following Sabbath's lead into territory that was often \"darker and more menacing\", hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant, good-time music."}
