The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre, particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade. The anthemic <a2_0><b8_0>The Final Countdown<b8_0/><a2_0/> (1986) by Swedish group <b7_0>Europe<b7_0/> was an international hit, reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries. This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum d\u00e9but albums in 1986. Van Halen released <a3_0><b9_0>5150<b9_0/><a3_0/> (1986), their first album with <a4_0>Sammy Hagar<a4_0/> on lead vocals, which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies. By the second half of the decade, hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States."}
