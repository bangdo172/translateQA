Acts like Creed, Staind, Puddle of Mudd and <b7_0>Nickelback<b7_0/> took the genre into the 2000s with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs. They were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown and Seether. Acts with more conventional hard rock sounds included Andrew W.K., <b8_0>Beautiful Creatures<b8_0/> and Buckcherry, whose breakthrough album 15 (2006) went platinum and spawned the single <a4_0>\"Sorry\"<a4_0/> (2007), which made the Top 10 of the Billboard 100. These were joined by bands with hard rock leanings that emerged in the mid-2000s from the garage rock or post punk revival, including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Kings of Leon, and Queens of the Stone Age from the US, Three Days Grace from <a1_0>Canada<a1_0/>, Jet from <a2_0>Australia<a2_0/> and The Datsuns from New Zealand. In <b9_0>2009<b9_0/> <a3_0>Them Crooked Vultures<a3_0/>, a supergroup that brought together Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl, Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme and Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones attracted attention as a live act and released a self-titled debut album that reached the top 20 in the US and UK and the top ten in several other countries."}
