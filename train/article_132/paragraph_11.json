The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock, evident in the works of Deep Purple, was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent. <a3_0>Scottish<a3_0/> band <b8_0>Nazareth<b8_0/> released their self-titled d\u00e9but album in 1971, producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling, Hair of the Dog (1975), which contained the proto-power ballad \"Love Hurts\".
