Although most <b7_0>grunge bands<b7_0/> had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock, several, including <a2_0>Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden<a2_0/>, were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal, while <a3_0>Stone Temple Pilots<a3_0/> managed to turn <b8_0>alternative rock<b8_0/> into a form of stadium rock. However, all grunge bands shunned the <b9_0>macho, anthemic and fashion-focused aesthetics<b9_0/> particularly associated with glam metal.
