Other bands such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands' commercial viability during the decade. In 1995 Van Halen released <a0_0><b6_0>Balance<b6_0/><a0_0/>, a multi-platinum seller that would be the band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer <a2_0><b7_0>Gary Cherone<b7_0/><a2_0/>, was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album <b8_0>Van Halen III<b8_0/> and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Guns N' Roses' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade. Drummer <a1_0>Steven Adler<a1_0/> was fired in 1990, guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band. <b9_0>Tensions<b9_0/> between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident? Guitarist Slash left in <a4_0>1996<a4_0/>, followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997. <a3_0>Axl Rose<a3_0/>, the only original member, worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete."}
