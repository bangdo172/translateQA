This was followed by US acts like M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, with their albums Too Fast for Love (<b8_0>1981<b8_0/>) and Shout at the Devil (<a4_0>1983<a4_0/>) and, as the style grew, the arrival of bands such as Ratt, White Lion, Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot. <a3_0>Quiet Riot<a3_0/>'s album <b9_0>Metal Health<b9_0/> (1983) was the first glam metal album, and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind, to reach number one in the Billboard music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands."}
