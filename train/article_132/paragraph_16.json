Cream, in songs like \"I Feel Free\" (<b6_0>1966<b6_0/>) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia, particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of <a0_0><b7_0>Eric Clapton<b7_0/><a0_0/>. <b8_0>Jimi Hendrix<b8_0/> produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock, which combined elements of jazz, blues and rock and roll. From 1967 Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, The <b9_0>Jeff Beck<b9_0/> Group. <a1_0>Dave Davies<a1_0/> of The Kinks, Keith Richards of <a4_0>The Rolling Stones<a4_0/>, <a2_0>Pete Townshend<a2_0/> of The Who, Hendrix, Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing, feedback and distortion. The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with the White Album in <a3_0>1968<a3_0/> and, with the track \"Helter Skelter\", attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has described the \"proto-metal roar\" of \"Helter Skelter,\" while Ian MacDonald argued that \"their attempts at emulating the heavy style were without exception embarrassing.\""}
