Heavy metal took on \"darker\" characteristics after <a1_0><b8_0>Black Sabbath<b8_0/><a1_0/>'s breakthrough at the beginning of the 1970s. In the 1980s it developed a number of subgenres, often termed extreme metal, some of which were influenced by <a2_0>hardcore punk<a2_0/>, and which further differentiated the two styles.
