Initially receiving mixed reviews, according to critic <b6_0>Steve Erlewine<b6_0/> it is now \"generally regarded as the Rolling Stones' finest album\". They continued to pursue the riff-heavy sound on albums including It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (1974) and Black and Blue (1976). Led Zeppelin began to mix elements of world and folk music into their hard rock from Led Zeppelin III (<b7_0>1970<b7_0/>) and <a1_0>Led Zeppelin IV<a1_0/> (<b8_0>1971<b8_0/>). The latter included the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", which would become the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio. Deep Purple continued to define hard rock, particularly with their album Machine Head (1972), which included the tracks <a2_0>\"Highway Star\" and \"Smoke on the Water\"<a2_0/>. In <b9_0>1975<b9_0/> guitarist <a3_0>Ritchie Blackmore<a3_0/> left, going on to form Rainbow and after the break-up of the band the next year, vocalist David Coverdale formed Whitesnake. 1970 saw The Who release Live at Leeds, often seen as the archetypal hard rock live album, and the following year they released their highly acclaimed album Who's Next, which mixed heavy rock with extensive use of synthesizers. Subsequent albums, including Quadrophenia (1973), built on this sound before Who Are You (1978), their last album before the death of pioneering rock drummer <a4_0>Keith Moon<a4_0/> later that year."}
