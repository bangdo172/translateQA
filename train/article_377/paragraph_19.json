In this dormant state, these organisms may remain viable <a2_0>for millions of years<a2_0/>, and endospores even allow bacteria to survive exposure to the vacuum and radiation in space. According to scientist Dr. Steinn Sigurdsson, \"There are viable bacterial spores that have been found that are 40 million years old on Earth \u2014 and we know they're very hardened to radiation.\" Endospore-forming bacteria can also cause disease: for example, anthrax can be contracted by the inhalation of Bacillus anthracis endospores, and contamination of deep puncture wounds with <a3_0>Clostridium tetani<a3_0/> endospores causes tetanus."}
