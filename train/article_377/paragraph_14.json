The <a0_0>cell membrane and cell wall<a0_0/> comprise the cell envelope. A common bacterial cell wall material is <a1_0>peptidoglycan<a1_0/> (called \"murein\" in older sources), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. <a2_0>Bacterial cell walls are different<a2_0/> from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of <a3_0>cellulose and chitin<a3_0/>, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria <a4_0>by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan<a4_0/>."}
