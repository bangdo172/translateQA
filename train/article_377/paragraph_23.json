Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as <a1_0>ethanol<a1_0/> in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes <a2_0>can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors<a2_0/> depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves."}
