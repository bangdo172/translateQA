For example, when starved of <a0_0>amino acids<a0_0/>, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells in a process known as quorum sensing, migrate toward each other, and <a1_0>aggregate to form fruiting bodies<a1_0/> up to 500 micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of <a3_0>multicellular organisation<a3_0/>. For example, about one in 10 cells migrate to the top of these fruiting bodies and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called myxospores, which are <a2_0>more resistant<a2_0/> to drying and other adverse environmental conditions than are ordinary cells."}
