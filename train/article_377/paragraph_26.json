Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and <a2_0>divide extremely rapidly<a2_0/>, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8 minutes. In cell division, <a3_0>two identical clone daughter cells<a3_0/> are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by Myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces, or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell."}
