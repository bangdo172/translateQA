Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a <a1_0>nucleus<a1_0/> and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the <a2_0>1990s<a2_0/> that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor. These evolutionary domains are called <a3_0>Bacteria and Archaea<a3_0/>."}
