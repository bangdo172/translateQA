Diagnostics using DNA-based tools, such as <a1_0>polymerase chain reaction<a1_0/>, are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed, compared to culture-based methods. These methods also allow the detection and <a2_0>identification of \"viable but nonculturable\" cells<a2_0/> that are metabolically active but non-dividing. However, even using these improved methods, the total number of bacterial species is not known and <a3_0>cannot even be estimated with any certainty<a3_0/>. Following present classification, there are a little less than 9,300 known species of prokaryotes, which includes bacteria and archaea; but attempts to estimate the true number of bacterial diversity have ranged from 107 to 109 total species \u2013 and even these diverse estimates may be off by many orders of magnitude."}
