Solid growth media, such as <a1_0><a3_0>agar plates<a3_0/><a1_0/>, are used to isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, <a2_0>liquid growth media<a2_0/> are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. <a4_0>The use of selective media<a4_0/> (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms."}
