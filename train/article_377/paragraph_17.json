They are distributed over the surface of the cell, and resemble fine hairs when seen under the electron microscope. Fimbriae are believed to be <a2_0>involved in attachment to solid surfaces or to other cells<a2_0/>, and are essential for the virulence of some bacterial pathogens. Pili (sing. pilus) are <a3_0>cellular appendages<a3_0/>, slightly larger than fimbriae, that can transfer genetic material between bacterial cells in a process called conjugation where they are called conjugation pili or \"sex pili\" (see bacterial genetics, below). They can also generate movement where they are called type IV pili (see movement, below)."}
