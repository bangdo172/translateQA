The Planctomycetes are the exception (as they are in possessing membranes around their nuclear material). It has recently been shown that Gemmata obscuriglobus is able to take in large molecules via a process that in some ways resembles <a2_0>endocytosis<a2_0/>, the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items."}
