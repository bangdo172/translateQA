Bacteria can be classified on the basis of cell structure, cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components, such as DNA, fatty acids, pigments, antigens and quinones. While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was <a1_0>unclear<a1_0/> whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was due to the <a2_0>lack of distinctive structures in most bacteria,<a2_0/> as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very <a3_0>different morphologies and metabolisms<a3_0/>. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification <a4_0>emphasizes molecular systematics<a4_0/>, using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridization, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the rRNA gene. Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria."}
