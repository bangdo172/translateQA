However, all bacteria can evolve by selection on <a1_0>changes to their genetic material DNA<a1_0/> caused by genetic recombination or mutations. Mutations come from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to mutagens. Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria. Genetic changes in bacterial genomes come from either <a2_0>random mutation during replication or \"stress-directed mutation\"<a2_0/>, where genes involved in a particular growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate."}
