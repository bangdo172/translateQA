The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about <a3_0>20 proteins<a3_0/>, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that <a4_0>uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane<a4_0/> for power. This motor drives the motion of the filament, which acts as a propeller."}
