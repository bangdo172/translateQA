This serves to <a2_0>provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen<a2_0/> for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of <a3_0>over 1,000 bacterial species<a3_0/> in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually <a4_0>through competitive exclusion<a4_0/>) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements."}
