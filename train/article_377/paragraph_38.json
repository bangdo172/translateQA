However, molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate domains, originally called <a1_0>Eubacteria and Archaebacteria<a1_0/>, but now called Bacteria and Archaea that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor. The <a2_0>archaea and eukaryotes<a2_0/> are more closely related to each other than either is to the bacteria. These two domains, along with Eukarya, are the basis of the <a3_0>three-domain system<a3_0/>, which is currently the most widely used classification system in microbiolology. However, due to the relatively recent introduction of molecular systematics and a rapid increase in the number of genome sequences that are available, bacterial classification remains a changing and expanding field. For example, a few biologists argue that the Archaea and Eukaryotes evolved from Gram-positive bacteria."}
