In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as <a1_0>both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism<a1_0/>. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, <a2_0>oxygen<a2_0/> is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic."}
