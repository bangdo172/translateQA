These include organisms such as Myxococcus xanthus, which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter. Other bacterial predators either <a1_0>attach to their prey in order to digest them<a1_0/> and absorb nutrients, such as Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus, or <a2_0>invade another cell and multiply inside the cytosol<a2_0/>, such as Daptobacter. These predatory bacteria are thought to have evolved from <a3_0>saprophages<a3_0/> that consumed dead microorganisms, through adaptations that allowed them to entrap and kill other organisms."}
