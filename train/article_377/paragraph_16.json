The <a0_0>high mycolic acid content<a0_0/> of Mycobacteria, is responsible for the <a1_0>staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention.<a1_0/> The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the <a2_0>Ziehl-Neelsen stain<a2_0/> or acid-fast stain, in which the acid-fast bacilli are stained bright-red and stand out clearly against a blue background. L-form bacteria are strains of bacteria that lack cell walls. The main pathogenic bacteria in this class is <a3_0>Mycoplasma<a3_0/> (not to be confused with Mycobacteria)."}
