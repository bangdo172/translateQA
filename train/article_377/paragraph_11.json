The general lack of internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane <a1_0>between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space<a1_0/>. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of <a2_0>light-gathering membrane<a2_0/>. These <a3_0>light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures<a3_0/> called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm."}
