In almost all cases, one endospore is formed and this <a1_0>is not a reproductive process<a1_0/>, although Anaerobacter can make up to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a <a2_0>cortex layer<a2_0/> and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. <a3_0>Dipicolinic acid<a3_0/> is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore."}
