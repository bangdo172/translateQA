The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of <a1_0>the immune system<a1_0/>, and some are beneficial. However, several species of bacteria are <a2_0>pathogenic<a2_0/> and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are <a3_0>respiratory infections<a3_0/>, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in <a4_0>farming<a4_0/>, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals."}
