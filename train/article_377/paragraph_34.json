In such cases, <a2_0>gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment<a2_0/> is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens."}
