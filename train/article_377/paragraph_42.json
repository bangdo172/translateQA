One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of <a1_0>anaerobic bacteria<a1_0/> that consume organic acids, such as <a2_0>butyric acid or propionic acid<a2_0/>, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow."}
