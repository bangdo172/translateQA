There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and <a2_0>in intensive farming to promote animal growth<a2_0/>, where they may be contributing to the <a3_0>rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations<a3_0/>. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as <a4_0>sterilizing<a4_0/> the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilized to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection."}
