Many types of bacteriophage exist, some simply <a1_0>infect and lyse their host bacteria<a1_0/>, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome. A bacteriophage can contain genes that contribute to its host's phenotype: for example, in the evolution of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Clostridium botulinum, the toxin genes in an integrated phage converted a harmless ancestral bacterium into a <a2_0>lethal pathogen<a2_0/>. Bacteria resist phage infection through restriction modification systems that degrade foreign DNA, and a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. This <a3_0>CRISPR system provides bacteria with acquired immunity<a3_0/> to infection."}
