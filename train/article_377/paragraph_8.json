These films can range from a few micrometers in thickness to <a1_0>up to half a meter in depth<a1_0/>, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as <a2_0>microcolonies,<a2_0/> through which there are networks of channels <a3_0>to enable better diffusion of nutrients<a3_0/>. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and <a4_0>bacteria protected within biofilms<a4_0/> are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria."}
