Elongation is associated with swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or <a2_0>tightly coiled<a2_0/>, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as <a3_0>branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section<a3_0/>. The large surface area to volume ratio of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it <a4_0>can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients<a4_0/>, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators."}
