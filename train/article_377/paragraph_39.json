The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the \"Gram-positive\" cell wall stain <a2_0>purple<a2_0/>, while the thin \"Gram-negative\" cell wall appears <a3_0>pink<a3_0/>. By combining morphology and Gram-staining, most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups (Gram-positive cocci, Gram-positive bacilli, Gram-negative cocci and Gram-negative bacilli). Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the Gram stain, particularly mycobacteria or Nocardia, which show acid-fastness on <a4_0>Ziehl\u2013Neelsen<a4_0/> or similar stains. Other organisms may need to be identified by their growth in special media, or by other techniques, such as serology."}
