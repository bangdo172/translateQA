In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first <a2_0>enter a special physiological state termed competence<a2_0/> (see Natural competence). In Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required for the development of competence. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be <a3_0>between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome<a3_0/>. Transformation appears to be <a4_0>common<a4_0/> among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells."}
