Patan in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts. Art in Kathmandu is vibrant, demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and <a0_0>modern<a0_0/> art, derived from a great number of national, Asian, and global influences. Nepali art is commonly divided into <a1_0>two<a1_0/> areas: the idealistic traditional painting known as <a4_0>Paubhas<a4_0/> in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as <a2_0>Thangkas<a2_0/> in Tibet, closely linked to the country's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting, including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for. Internationally, the British-based charity, the <a3_0>Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre<a3_0/> is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu."}
