However, the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon, and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city. Consumption of <a0_0>beef<a0_0/> is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places. Buff (meat of <a1_0>water buffalo<a1_0/>) is very common. There is a strong tradition of buff consumption in Kathmandu, especially among <a2_0>Newars<a2_0/>, which is not found in other parts of Nepal. Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago. Due to the intermixing with <a3_0>Kirat<a3_0/> cuisine from eastern Nepal, pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes. A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo. The Muslims forbid eating buff as from Quran while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow's meat as the consider Cow to be a goddess and symbol of purity. The chief breakfast for locals and visitors is mostly <a4_0>Momo or Chowmein<a4_0/>."}
