According to Gopalraj Vansawali, a genealogy of Nepali monarchs, the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were Gopalas, Mahispalas, Aabhirs, Kirants, and Somavanshi. The Kirata dynasty was established by <a0_0>Yalamber<a0_0/>. During the Kirata era, a settlement called Yambu existed in the <a1_0>northern<a1_0/> half of old Kathmandu. In some of the <a2_0>Sino-Tibetan<a2_0/> languages, Kathmandu is still called Yambu. Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the <a3_0>southern half<a3_0/> of old Kathmandu, near Manjupattan.
