Of these, Kathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone (elevation ranging from 1,200\u20132,300 metres (3,900\u20137,500 ft)), where the climate is fairly temperate, atypical for the region. This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between <a3_0>2,100\u20133,300<a3_0/> metres (6,900\u201310,800 ft). Under K\u00f6ppen's climate classification, portions of the city with lower elevations have a <a1_0>humid subtropical climate<a1_0/> (<a2_0>Cwa<a2_0/>), while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate. In the Kathmandu Valley, which is representative of its valley's climate, the average summer temperature varies from 28\u201330 \u00b0C (82\u201386 \u00b0F). The average winter temperature is 10.1 \u00b0C (<a0_0>50.2<a0_0/> \u00b0F)."}
