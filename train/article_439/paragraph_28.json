Kumari, or Kumari Devi, is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or devi in South Asian countries. In Nepal the selection process is very rigorous. Kumari is believed to be the bodily incarnation of the goddess <a0_0>Taleju<a0_0/> (the Nepali name for Durga) <a1_0>until she menstruates<a1_0/>, after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury are also causes for her to revert to common status. The current Royal Kumari, <a2_0>Matina Shakya<a2_0/>, age four, was installed in October 2008 by the <a3_0>Maoist<a3_0/> government that replaced the monarchy."}
