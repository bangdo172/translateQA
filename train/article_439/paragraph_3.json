Mahanagar means \"<a4_0>great city<a4_0/>\". The city is called \"Kasthamandap\" in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day. Thus, Kathmandu is also known as Kasthamandap. During medieval times, the city was sometimes called <a1_0>Kantipur<a1_0/> (\u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930). This name is derived from two Sanskrit words - Kanti and pur. \"Kanti\" is one of the names of the Goddess <a2_0>Lakshmi<a2_0/>, and \"<a3_0>pur<a3_0/>\" means place."}
