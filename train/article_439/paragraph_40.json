It seeks to document 50 years of research and cultural heritage conservation of the Kathmandu Valley, documenting what artists photographers architects anthropologists from abroad had contributed in the second half of the 20th century. The actual structure of the Museum showcases restoration and rehabilitation efforts to preserve the built heritage of Kathmandu. It was designed by <a1_0>Carl Pruscha<a1_0/> (master-planner of the Kathmandy Valley ) in 1970 and constructed in <a2_0>1971<a2_0/>. Restoration works began in 2010 to rehabilitate the Taragaon <a4_0>hostel<a4_0/> into the Taragaon Museum. The design uses local brick along with modern architectural design elements, as well as the use of circle, triangles and squares. The Museum is within a short walk from the <a3_0>Boudhnath<a3_0/> stupa, which itself can be seen from the Museum tower."}
