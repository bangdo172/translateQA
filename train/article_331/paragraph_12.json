However, evidence of social inequality is still disputed, as settlements such as <a3_0><b7_0>Catal Huyuk<b7_0/><a3_0/> reveal a striking lack of difference in the size of homes and burial sites, suggesting a more egalitarian society with no evidence of the concept of capital, although some homes do appear slightly larger or more elaborately decorated than others."}
