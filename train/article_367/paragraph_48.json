For radio waves, one important reflector is the <a1_0>ionosphere<a1_0/> which can change the wave's polarization. Thus for signals received following reflection by the ionosphere (<a4_0>a skywave<a4_0/>), a consistent polarization cannot be expected. For line-of-sight communications or ground wave propagation, horizontally or vertically <a3_0>polarized transmissions<a3_0/> generally remain in about the same polarization state at the receiving location. Matching the receiving antenna's polarization to that of the <a2_0>transmitter<a2_0/> can make a very substantial difference in received signal strength."}
