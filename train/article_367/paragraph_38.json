It is typically represented by a <a1_0>three-dimensional graph<a1_0/>, or polar plots of the horizontal and vertical cross sections. The pattern of an ideal <a2_0>isotropic<a2_0/> antenna, which radiates equally in all directions, would look like a sphere. Many <a3_0>nondirectional<a3_0/> antennas, such as monopoles and dipoles, emit equal power in all horizontal directions, with the power dropping off at higher and lower angles; this is called an omnidirectional pattern and when plotted looks like a torus or <a4_0>donut<a4_0/>."}
