An antenna's <a1_0>bandwidth<a1_0/> specifies the range of frequencies over which its performance does not suffer due to a poor <a2_0>impedance match<a2_0/>. Also in the case of a Yagi-Uda array, the use of the antenna very far away from its design frequency reduces the antenna's <a3_0>directivity<a3_0/>, thus reducing the usable bandwidth regardless of impedance matching."}
