It is built along a support boom that is pointed toward the signal, and thus sees no induced signal and <a1_0>does not contribute<a1_0/> to the antenna's operation. The end closer to the source is referred to as the front. Near the rear is a single active element, typically a half-wave dipole or folded dipole. Passive elements are arranged in front (<a2_0>directors<a2_0/>) and behind (reflectors) the active element along the boom. The Yagi has the inherent quality that it becomes <a3_0>increasingly directional<a3_0/>, and thus has higher gain, as the number of elements increases. However, this also makes it increasingly sensitive to changes in frequency; if the signal frequency changes, not only does the active element receive less energy directly, but all of the passive elements adding to that signal also decrease their output as well and their signals no longer reach the active element in-phase."}
