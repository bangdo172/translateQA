The dipole antennas composing it are all considered \"active elements\" since they are all electrically connected together (and to the transmission line). On the other hand, a superficially similar dipole array, the <a3_0>Yagi-Uda Antenna<a3_0/> (or simply \"Yagi\"), has only one dipole element with an electrical connection; the other so-called parasitic elements interact with the electromagnetic field in order to realize a fairly directional antenna but one which is limited to a rather narrow bandwidth. The Yagi antenna has similar looking parasitic dipole elements but which act differently due to their somewhat different lengths. There may be a number of so-called \"directors\" in front of the active element in the direction of propagation, and usually a single (but possibly more) \"reflector\" on the opposite side of the active element."}
