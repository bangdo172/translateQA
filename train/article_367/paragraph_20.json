This consists of two 1\u20444-wavelength elements arranged end-to-end, and lying along essentially the same axis (or <a1_0>collinear<a1_0/>), each feeding one side of a two-conductor transmission wire. The physical arrangement of the two elements places them 180 degrees out of phase, which means that at any given instant one of the elements is driving current into the <a2_0>transmission line<a2_0/> while the other is pulling it out. The monopole antenna is essentially one half of the half-wave dipole, a single 1\u20444-wavelength element with the other side connected to ground or an equivalent ground plane (or counterpoise). <a3_0>Monopoles<a3_0/>, which are one-half the size of a dipole, are common for long-wavelength radio signals where a dipole would be impractically large. Another common design is the <a4_0>folded dipole<a4_0/>, which is essentially two dipoles placed side-by-side and connected at their ends to make a single one-wavelength antenna."}
