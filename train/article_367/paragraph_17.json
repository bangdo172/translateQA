The physical size of an antenna is often a practical issue, particularly <a2_0>at lower frequencies<a2_0/> (longer wavelengths). <a3_0>Highly directional<a3_0/> antennas need to be significantly larger than the wavelength. Resonant antennas usually use a linear conductor (or element), or pair of such elements, each of which is about a quarter of the wavelength in length (an odd multiple of quarter wavelengths will also be resonant). Antennas that are required to be <a4_0>small<a4_0/> compared to the wavelength sacrifice efficiency and cannot be very directional. Fortunately at higher frequencies (UHF, microwaves) trading off performance to obtain a smaller physical size is usually not required."}
