This makes <a2_0>resonant<a2_0/> antenna designs inherently narrowband, and they are most commonly used with a <a1_0>single target signal<a1_0/>. They are particularly common on radar systems, where the same antenna is used for both broadcast and reception, or for radio and television broadcasts, where the antenna is working with a single frequency. They are less commonly used for reception where multiple channels are present, in which case additional modifications are used to increase the <a3_0>bandwidth<a3_0/>, or entirely different antenna designs are used."}
