There is almost no relative phase shift. If the emission is <a1_0>polarized vertically<a1_0/>, the two fields (direct and reflected) add and there is maximum of received signal. If the signal is polarized horizontally, the two signals subtract and the received signal is largely cancelled. The vertical plane radiation patterns are shown in the <a2_0>image at right<a2_0/>. With vertical polarization there is always a maximum for \u03b8=0, horizontal propagation (left pattern). For horizontal polarization, there is cancellation at that angle. Note that the above formulae and these plots assume the ground as a perfect conductor. These plots of the radiation pattern correspond to a distance between the antenna and its image of 2.5\u03bb. As the antenna height is increased, the number of <a3_0>lobes<a3_0/> increases as well."}
