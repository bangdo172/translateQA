A high-<a0_0>gain<a0_0/> antenna will radiate most of its power in a particular direction, while a low-gain antenna will radiate over a wider angle. The antenna gain, or <a1_0>power gain<a1_0/> of an antenna is defined as the ratio of the intensity (<a2_0>power per unit surface area<a2_0/>)  radiated by the antenna in the direction of its maximum output, at an arbitrary distance, divided by the intensity  radiated at the same distance by a hypothetical <a3_0>isotropic<a3_0/> antenna which radiates equal power in all directions. This dimensionless ratio is usually expressed logarithmically in decibels, these units are called \"decibels-isotropic\" (dBi)"}
