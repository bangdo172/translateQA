Radio waves are electromagnetic waves which carry signals through the air (or through space) at the <a1_0>speed of light<a1_0/> with almost no transmission loss. Radio transmitters and receivers are used to convey signals (information) in systems including broadcast (audio) radio, television, <a2_0>mobile telephones<a2_0/>, Wi-Fi (WLAN) data networks, trunk lines and point-to-point communications links (telephone, data networks), satellite links, many remote controlled devices such as garage door openers, and wireless remote sensors, among many others. Radio waves are also used directly for measurements in technologies including radar, <a3_0>GPS<a3_0/>, and radio astronomy. In each and every case, the transmitters and receivers involved require <a4_0>antennas<a4_0/>, although these are sometimes hidden (such as the antenna inside an AM radio or inside a laptop computer equipped with Wi-Fi)."}
