The refractor alters the <a2_0>spatial characteristics<a2_0/> of the wave on one side relative to the other side. It can, for instance, bring the wave to a focus or alter the wave front in other ways, generally in order to maximize the directivity of the antenna system. This is the radio equivalent of an <a3_0>optical lens<a3_0/>."}
