For a <a1_0>terrestrial antenna<a1_0/>, the ground is usually one such object of importance. The antenna's height above the ground, as well as the electrical properties (permittivity and conductivity) of the ground, can then be important. Also, in the particular case of a monopole antenna, the ground (or an <a2_0>artificial ground plane<a2_0/>) serves as the <a3_0>return connection<a3_0/> for the antenna current thus having an additional effect, particularly on the impedance seen by the feed line."}
