This often involves a number of <a1_0>parallel<a1_0/> dipole antennas with a certain spacing. Depending on the <a3_0>relative phase<a3_0/> introduced by the network, the same combination of dipole antennas can operate as a \"broadside array\" (directional normal to a line connecting the elements) or as an \"end-fire array\" (directional along the line connecting the elements). Antenna arrays may employ any basic (<a2_0>omnidirectional or weakly directional<a2_0/>) antenna type, such as dipole, loop or slot antennas. These elements are often identical."}
