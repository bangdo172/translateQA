The antenna array and very similar reflective array antenna consist of multiple elements, often <a1_0>half-wave dipoles<a1_0/>, spaced out on a plane and wired together with transmission lines with specific <a2_0>phase lengths<a2_0/> to produce a single in-phase signal at the output. The <a3_0>log-periodic<a3_0/> antenna is a more complex design that uses multiple in-line elements similar in appearance to the Yagi-Uda but using transmission lines between the elements to produce the output."}
