This effect can also be used to <a1_0>increase<a1_0/> signal through the use of a reflector, normally placed behind the active element and spaced so the reflected signal reaches the element in-phase. Generally the reflector will remain highly reflective even if it is not solid; gaps <a2_0>less than 1\u204410<a2_0/> generally have little effect on the outcome. For this reason, reflectors often take the form of wire meshes or rows of passive elements, which makes them lighter and less subject to wind. The <a3_0>parabolic reflector<a3_0/> is perhaps the best known example of a reflector-based antenna, which has an effective area far greater than the active element alone."}
