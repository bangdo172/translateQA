Resonating such an inductor with <a0_0>a capacitor at the frequency of operation<a0_0/> not only cancels the reactance but greatly magnifies the very small radiation resistance of such a <a1_0>loop<a1_0/>.[citation needed] This is implemented in most AM broadcast receivers, with a <a2_0>small ferrite loop antenna<a2_0/> resonated by a capacitor which is varied along with the receiver tuning in order to maintain resonance over the AM broadcast band"}
