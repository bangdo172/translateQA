In order to efficiently send the signal into the transmission line, it is important that the transmission line has the same impedance as the elements, otherwise some of the signal will be reflected back into the antenna. This leads to the concept of impedance matching, the design of the overall system of antenna and transmission line so the <a1_0>impedance<a1_0/> is as close as possible, thereby reducing these losses. <a2_0>Impedance matching<a2_0/> between antennas and transmission lines is commonly handled through the use of a <a3_0>balun<a3_0/>, although other solutions are also used in certain roles. An important measure of this basic concept is the standing wave ratio, which measures the magnitude of the reflected signal."}
