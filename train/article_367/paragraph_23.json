By adding an <a0_0>inductance<a0_0/> in series with the antenna, a so-called loading coil, the capacitive reactance of this antenna can be cancelled leaving a pure resistance which can then be matched to the <a1_0>transmission line<a1_0/>. Sometimes the resulting resonant frequency of such a system (antenna plus matching network) is described using the construct of electrical length and the use of a shorter antenna at a lower frequency than its resonant frequency is termed <a2_0>electrical lengthening<a2_0/>."}
