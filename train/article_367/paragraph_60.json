For instance, if a radio wave passing a given location has a flux of 1 pW / m2 (10\u221212 watts per square meter) and an antenna has an effective area of 12 m2, then the antenna would deliver <a3_0>12 pW of RF power<a3_0/> to the receiver (30 <a1_0>microvolts<a1_0/> rms at 75 ohms). Since the receiving antenna is not equally sensitive to signals received from all directions, the effective area is a function of the <a2_0>direction<a2_0/> to the source."}
