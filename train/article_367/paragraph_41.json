The power supplied to the antenna terminals which is not radiated is converted into <a1_0>heat<a1_0/>. This is usually through loss resistance in the antenna's conductors, but can also be due to dielectric or magnetic core losses in antennas (or antenna systems) using such components. Such loss effectively robs power from the transmitter, requiring a stronger <a2_0>transmitter<a2_0/> in order to transmit a signal of a given strength."}
