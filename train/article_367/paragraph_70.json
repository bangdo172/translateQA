For an antenna element  not connected to anything (<a0_0>open circuited<a0_0/>) one can write . But for an element  which is <a1_0>short circuited<a1_0/>, a current is generated across that short but no voltage is allowed, so the corresponding . This is the case, for instance, with the so-called parasitic elements of a <a3_0>Yagi-Uda<a3_0/> antenna where the solid rod can be viewed as a dipole antenna shorted across its <a4_0>feedpoint<a4_0/>. <a2_0>Parasitic<a2_0/> elements are unpowered elements that absorb and reradiate RF energy according to the induced current calculated using such a system of equations."}
