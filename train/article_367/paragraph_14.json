Most materials used in antennas meet these conditions, but some microwave antennas use high-tech components such as isolators and circulators, made of nonreciprocal materials such as <a2_0>ferrite<a2_0/>. These can be used to give the antenna a different behavior on receiving than it has on transmitting, which can be useful in applications like <a3_0>radar<a3_0/>."}
