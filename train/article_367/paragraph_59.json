If the ground is a very good conductor then almost all of the wave is reflected (<a2_0>180\u00b0 out of phase<a2_0/>), whereas a ground modeled as a (lossy) dielectric can absorb a large amount of the wave's power. The <a3_0>power remaining<a3_0/> in the reflected wave, and the phase shift upon reflection, strongly depend on the wave's angle of incidence and polarization. The dielectric constant and conductivity (or simply the complex dielectric constant) is dependent on the soil type and is a function of frequency."}
