A <a2_0>circularly polarized<a2_0/> antenna can be used to equally well match vertical or horizontal linear polarizations. Transmission from a circularly polarized antenna received by a linearly polarized antenna (or vice versa) entails a 3 dB reduction in <a3_0>signal-to-noise ratio<a3_0/> as the received power has thereby been cut in half."}
