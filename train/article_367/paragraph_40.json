At each interface, depending on the impedance match, some fraction of the wave's energy will reflect back to the source, forming a <a1_0>standing wave<a1_0/> in the feed line. The ratio of maximum power to minimum power in the wave can be measured and is called the <a2_0>standing wave ratio<a2_0/> (SWR). A SWR of 1:1 is ideal. A SWR of 1.5:1 is considered to be marginally acceptable in low power applications where power loss is more critical, although an SWR as high as 6:1 may still be usable with the right equipment. Minimizing impedance differences at each interface (impedance matching) will reduce SWR and maximize <a3_0>power transfer<a3_0/> through each part of the antenna system."}
