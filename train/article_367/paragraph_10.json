For reception, a long Beverage antenna can have significant directivity. For non directional portable use, a <a2_0>short vertical antenna<a2_0/> or small loop antenna works well, with the main design challenge being that of <a3_0>impedance matching<a3_0/>. With a vertical antenna a loading coil at the base of the antenna may be employed to cancel the reactive component of impedance; small loop antennas are tuned with parallel capacitors for this purpose."}
