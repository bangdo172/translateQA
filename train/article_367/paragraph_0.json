It is usually used with a <a1_0>radio transmitter or radio receiver<a1_0/>. In <a2_0>transmission<a2_0/>, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as <a3_0>electromagnetic waves<a3_0/> (radio waves). In <a4_0>reception<a4_0/>, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified."}
