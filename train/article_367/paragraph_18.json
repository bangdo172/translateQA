This relies on the behaviour of moving <a1_0>electrons<a1_0/>, which reflect off surfaces where the dielectric constant changes, in a fashion similar to the way light reflects when optical properties change. In these designs, the <a2_0>reflective<a2_0/> surface is created by the end of a conductor, normally a thin metal wire or rod, which in the simplest case has a feed point at one end where it is connected to a transmission line. The conductor, or element, is aligned with the electrical field of the desired signal, normally meaning it is <a3_0>perpendicular<a3_0/> to the line from the antenna to the source (or receiver in the case of a broadcast antenna)."}
