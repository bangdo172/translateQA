Thus, a simple straight wire antenna will have <a1_0>one<a1_0/> polarization when mounted vertically, and a different polarization when mounted horizontally. As a <a3_0>transverse wave<a3_0/>, the magnetic field of a radio wave is at right angles to that of the electric field, but by convention, talk of an antenna's \"<a2_0>polarization<a2_0/>\" is understood to refer to the direction of the electric field."}
