In principle this can always be done with a transformer, however the <a0_0>turns ratio<a0_0/> of a transformer is not adjustable. A general matching network with at least <a1_0>two adjustments<a1_0/> can be made to correct both components of impedance. Matching networks using discrete inductors and capacitors will have losses associated with those components, and will have power restrictions when used for transmitting. Avoiding these difficulties, commercial antennas are generally designed with fixed matching elements or feeding strategies to get an approximate match to standard coax, such as <a2_0>50 or 75<a2_0/> Ohms. Antennas based on the dipole (rather than vertical antennas) should include a <a3_0>balun<a3_0/> in between the transmission line and antenna element, which may be integrated into any such <a4_0>matching network<a4_0/>."}
