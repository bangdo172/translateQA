Chief among these relate to the <a1_0>directional characteristics<a1_0/> (as depicted in the antenna's radiation pattern) and the resulting gain. Even in omnidirectional (or weakly directional) antennas, the gain can often be increased by concentrating more of its power in the <a2_0>horizontal directions<a2_0/>, sacrificing power radiated toward the sky and ground. The antenna's power gain (or simply \"gain\") also takes into account the antenna's <a3_0>efficiency<a3_0/>, and is often the primary figure of merit."}
