This is because the radio waves emitted by different parts of the antenna typically <a1_0>interfere<a1_0/>, causing maxima at angles where the radio waves arrive at distant points in phase, and zero radiation at other angles where the radio waves arrive out of phase. In a directional antenna designed to project radio waves in a particular direction, the <a2_0>lobe<a2_0/> in that direction is designed larger than the others and is called the \"main lobe\". The other lobes usually <a3_0>represent unwanted radiation<a3_0/> and are called \"sidelobes\". The axis through the main lobe is called the \"principal axis\" or \"boresight axis\"."}
