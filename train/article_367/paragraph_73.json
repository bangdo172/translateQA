For example, the \"receiving pattern\" (sensitivity as a function of direction) of an antenna when used for reception is identical to the radiation pattern of the antenna when it is driven and functions as a radiator. This is a consequence of the <a1_0>reciprocity theorem of electromagnetics<a1_0/>. Therefore, in discussions of antenna properties no distinction is usually made between receiving and transmitting terminology, and the antenna can be viewed as <a2_0>either transmitting or receiving<a2_0/>, whichever is more convenient."}
