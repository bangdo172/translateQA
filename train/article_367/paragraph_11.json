The <a1_0>antenna feed<a1_0/> may refer to all components connecting the antenna to the transmitter or receiver, such as an impedance matching network in addition to the transmission line. In a so-called <a2_0>aperture antenna<a2_0/>, such as a horn or parabolic dish, the \"feed\" may also refer to a basic antenna inside the entire system (normally at the focus of the parabolic dish or at the throat of a horn) which could be considered the one active element in that antenna system. A <a3_0>microwave antenna<a3_0/> may also be fed directly from a waveguide in place of a (conductive) transmission line."}
