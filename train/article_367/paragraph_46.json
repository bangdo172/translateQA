Most AM broadcast radios (except for car radios) take advantage of this principle by including a <a1_0>small loop antenna<a1_0/> for reception which has an extremely poor efficiency. Using such an inefficient antenna at this low frequency (530\u20131650 kHz) thus has <a2_0>little effect<a2_0/> on the receiver's net performance, but simply requires greater amplification by the receiver's electronics. Contrast this tiny component to the massive and very tall towers used at AM broadcast stations for transmitting at the very same frequency, where every percentage point of reduced antenna efficiency entails a <a3_0>substantial cost<a3_0/>."}
