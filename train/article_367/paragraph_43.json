That <a1_0>resistance<a1_0/> will consist of the sum of the radiation resistance Rr and the loss resistance Rloss. If an rms current I is delivered to the terminals of an antenna, then a power of I2Rr will be radiated and a power of I2Rloss will be lost as heat. Therefore, the efficiency of an antenna is equal to <a2_0>Rr / (Rr + Rloss)<a2_0/>. Of course only the <a3_0>total resistance<a3_0/> Rr + Rloss can be directly measured."}
