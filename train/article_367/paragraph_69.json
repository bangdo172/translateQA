The mathematics presented below are useful in analyzing the <a2_0>electrical behaviour<a2_0/> of <a0_0>antenna arrays<a0_0/>, where the properties of the individual array elements (such as half wave dipoles) are already known. If those elements were widely separated and driven in a certain amplitude and phase, then each would act independently as that element is known to. However, because of the mutual interaction between their electric and magnetic fields due to <a3_0>proximity<a3_0/>, the currents in each element are not simply a function of the applied voltage (according to its driving point impedance), but depend on the currents in the other nearby elements. Note that this now is a near field phenomenon which could not be properly accounted for using the Friis transmission equation for instance."}
