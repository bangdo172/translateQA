A <a1_0>dipole<a1_0/> antenna is similar but consists of two such conductors extending in opposite directions, with a total length that is often, but not always, a half of a wavelength long. Dipoles are typically oriented <a2_0>horizontally<a2_0/> in which case they are weakly directional: signals are reasonably well radiated toward or received from all directions with the exception of the direction along the conductor itself; this region is called the antenna blind cone or <a3_0>null<a3_0/>."}
