Given the larger refractive index of the ground (typically <a0_0>n=2<a0_0/>) compared to air (<a1_0>n=1<a1_0/>), the phase of horizontally polarized radiation is reversed upon <a2_0>reflection<a2_0/> (a phase shift of  radians or 180\u00b0). On the other hand, the vertical component of the wave's electric field is reflected at grazing angles of incidence approximately in phase. These phase shifts apply as well to a ground modelled as a good <a3_0>electrical conductor<a3_0/>."}
