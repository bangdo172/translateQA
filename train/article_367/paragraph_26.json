Electrically this forms a single 1\u20442-wavelength element. But the overall current pattern is the same; the current will be zero at the two ends, and reach a maximum in the <a1_0>center<a1_0/>. Thus signals near the design frequency will continue to create a <a2_0>standing wave pattern<a2_0/>. Any varying electrical current, like the standing wave in the element, will radiate a signal. In this case, aside from resistive losses in the element, the rebroadcast signal will be significantly similar to the original signal in both magnitude and shape. If this element is placed so its signal reaches the main dipole in-phase, it will reinforce the original signal, and increase the current in the dipole. Elements used in this way are known as <a3_0>passive elements<a3_0/>."}
