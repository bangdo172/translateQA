Therefore, if one is trying to radiate a signal toward a receiver using a <a1_0>transmitter<a1_0/> of a given power, one need only compare the gain of various antennas rather than considering the efficiency as well. This is likewise true for a receiving antenna at very high (especially microwave) frequencies, where the point is to receive a signal which is strong compared to the receiver's noise temperature. However, in the case of a directional antenna used for receiving signals with the intention of rejecting interference from different directions, one is no longer concerned with the antenna efficiency, as discussed above. In this case, rather than quoting the antenna gain, one would be more concerned with the <a2_0>directive gain<a2_0/> which does not include the effect of antenna (in)efficiency. The directive gain of an antenna can be computed from the <a3_0>published gain<a3_0/> divided by the antenna's efficiency."}
