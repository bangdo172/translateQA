In the most general case, polarization is <a2_0>elliptical<a2_0/>, meaning that the polarization of the radio waves varies over time. Two special cases are linear polarization (the ellipse collapses into a line) as we have discussed above, and circular polarization (in which the two axes of the ellipse are equal). In linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along <a3_0>one direction<a3_0/>; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization. In circular polarization, the electric field (and magnetic field) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation. Circular or elliptically polarized radio waves are designated as right-handed or left-handed using the \"thumb in the direction of the propagation\" rule. Note that for circular polarization, optical researchers use the opposite right hand rule from the one used by radio engineers."}
