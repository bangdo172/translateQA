Loops with <a1_0>circumference of a wavelength<a1_0/> or larger act similarly to dipole antennas. However <a2_0>loops small<a2_0/> in comparison to a wavelength act differently. They interact with the magnetic field of the radio wave instead of the electric field as other antennas do, and so are relatively insensitive to nearby electrical noise. However they have <a3_0>low radiation resistance<a3_0/>, and so are inefficient for transmitting. They are used as receiving antennas at low frequencies, and also as <a4_0>direction finding<a4_0/> antennas."}
