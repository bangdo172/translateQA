When the irregularities of the surface are much smaller than the wavelength, we are in the regime of specular reflection, and the receiver sees both the real antenna and an image of the antenna under the ground due to <a1_0>reflection<a1_0/>. But if the <a3_0>ground has irregularities<a3_0/> not small compared to the wavelength, reflections will not be coherent but shifted by random phases. With shorter wavelengths (<a2_0>higher frequencies<a2_0/>), this is generally the case."}
