It turns out that the amount of <a0_0>reactance<a0_0/> seen at the terminals of a resonant antenna when the frequency is shifted, say, by 5%, depends very much on the <a1_0>diameter<a1_0/> of the conductor used. <a2_0>A long thin wire<a2_0/> used as a half-wave dipole (or quarter wave monopole) will have a reactance significantly greater than the resistive impedance it has at resonance, leading to a poor match and generally unacceptable performance. Making the element using a tube of a diameter perhaps 1/50 of its length, however, results in a reactance at this altered frequency which is not so great, and a much less serious mismatch which will only modestly damage the antenna's net performance. Thus rather thick tubes are typically used for the solid elements of such antennas, including Yagi-Uda arrays."}
