An example of a high-gain antenna is a <a1_0>parabolic dish<a1_0/> such as a satellite television antenna. <a2_0>Low-gain<a2_0/> antennas have shorter range, but the orientation of the antenna is relatively unimportant. An example of a low-gain antenna is the whip antenna found on portable radios and cordless phones. Antenna gain should not be confused with <a3_0>amplifier gain<a3_0/>, a separate parameter measuring the increase in signal power due to an amplifying device."}
