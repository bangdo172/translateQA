This will induce an additional current in the <a1_0>antenna element<a1_0/>, changing the current at the feedpoint for a given feedpoint voltage. Thus the <a2_0>antenna's impedance<a2_0/>, given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current, is altered due to the antenna's proximity to the ground. This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground. But as the antenna height is increased, the <a3_0>reduced power<a3_0/> of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on the antenna's impedance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna. Changing the antenna's height by a quarter wavelength, then changes the phase of the reflection by 180\u00b0, with a completely different effect on the antenna's impedance."}
