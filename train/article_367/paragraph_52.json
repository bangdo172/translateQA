In the case of a transmitter, however, the desired matching impedance might not correspond to the dynamic output impedance of the transmitter as analyzed as a source impedance but rather the design value (typically <a1_0>50 ohms<a1_0/>) required for efficient and safe operation of the transmitting circuitry. The intended impedance is normally resistive but a transmitter (and some receivers) may have additional adjustments to cancel a certain amount of reactance in order to <a2_0>\"tweak\" the match<a2_0/>. When a transmission line is used in between the antenna and the transmitter (or receiver) one generally would like an antenna system whose impedance is resistive and near the characteristic impedance of that transmission line in order to minimize the <a3_0>standing wave ratio<a3_0/> (SWR) and the increase in transmission line losses it entails, in addition to supplying a good match at the transmitter or receiver itself."}
