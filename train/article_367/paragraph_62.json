Then it may be said that the coil has lengthened the antenna to achieve an electrical length of <a2_0>2.5 meters<a2_0/>. However, the resulting resistive impedance achieved will be quite a bit <a1_0>lower<a1_0/> than the impedance of a resonant monopole, likely requiring further impedance matching. In addition to a lower radiation resistance, the <a3_0>reactance<a3_0/> becomes higher as the antenna size is reduced, and the resonant circuit formed by the antenna and the tuning coil has a Q factor that rises and eventually causes the bandwidth of the antenna to be inadequate for the signal being transmitted. This is the major factor that sets the size of antennas at 1 MHz and lower frequencies."}
