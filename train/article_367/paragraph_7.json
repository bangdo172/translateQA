This can be accomplished in many different ways leading to a plethora of antenna designs. The vast majority of designs are fed with a <a1_0>balanced line<a1_0/> (unlike a monopole antenna) and are based on the dipole antenna with additional components (or elements) which increase its directionality. Antenna \"gain\" in this instance describes the <a2_0>concentration<a2_0/> of radiated power into a particular solid angle of space, as opposed to the spherically uniform radiation of the ideal radiator. The increased power in the desired direction is at the expense of that in the undesired directions. Power is conserved, and there is no net power increase over that delivered from the power source (<a3_0>the transmitter<a3_0/>.)"}
