This causes an electrical current to begin flowing in the direction of the signal's <a1_0>instantaneous field<a1_0/>. When the resulting current reaches the end of the conductor, it reflects, which is equivalent to a <a2_0>180 degree change in phase<a2_0/>. If the conductor is 1\u20444 of a wavelength long, current from the feed point will undergo 90 degree phase change by the time it reaches the end of the conductor, reflect through 180 degrees, and then another 90 degrees as it travels back. That means it has undergone a total <a3_0>360 degree<a3_0/> phase change, returning it to the original signal. The current in the element thus adds to the current being created from the source at that instant. This process creates a standing wave in the conductor, with the maximum current at the feed."}
