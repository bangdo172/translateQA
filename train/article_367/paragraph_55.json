They are typically wire antennas multiple wavelengths long, through which the voltage and current waves travel in <a1_0>one direction<a1_0/>, instead of bouncing back and forth to form standing waves as in resonant antennas. They have linear polarization (except for the <a2_0>helical antenna<a2_0/>). Unidirectional traveling wave antennas are terminated by a <a3_0>resistor<a3_0/> at one end equal to the <a4_0>antenna's characteristic resistance<a4_0/>, to absorb the waves from one direction. This makes them inefficient as transmitting antennas."}
