For instance, a \"<a0_0>whip antenna<a0_0/>\" can be made significantly shorter than 1/4 wavelength long, for practical reasons, and then resonated using a so-called <a2_0>loading coil<a2_0/>. This physically large inductor at the base of the antenna has an inductive reactance which is the opposite of the <a1_0>capacitative reactance<a1_0/> that such a vertical antenna has at the desired operating frequency. The result is a pure resistance seen at <a3_0>feedpoint<a3_0/> of the loading coil; unfortunately that resistance is somewhat lower than would be desired to match commercial coax.[citation needed]"}
