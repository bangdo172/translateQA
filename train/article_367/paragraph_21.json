However, feeding that element with <a1_0>3f0<a1_0/> (whose wavelength is 1\u20443 that of f0) will also lead to a standing wave pattern. Thus, an antenna element is also resonant when its length is 3\u20444 of a wavelength. This is true for all odd multiples of <a2_0>1\u20444<a2_0/> wavelength. This allows some flexibility of design in terms of antenna lengths and feed points. Antennas used in such a fashion are known to be <a3_0>harmonically<a3_0/> operated."}
