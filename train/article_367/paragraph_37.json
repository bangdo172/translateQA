Consider an antenna with <a1_0>no loss<a1_0/>, that is, one whose electrical efficiency is 100%. It can be shown that its effective area averaged over all directions must be equal to \u03bb2/4\u03c0, the wavelength squared divided by 4\u03c0. Gain is defined such that the average gain over all directions for an antenna with 100% electrical efficiency is equal to <a2_0>1<a2_0/>. Therefore, the effective area <a3_0>Aeff<a3_0/> in terms of the gain G in a given direction is given by:"}
