Occasionally the term \"aerial\" is used to mean a <a1_0>wire antenna<a1_0/>. However, note the important international technical journal, the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation. In the United Kingdom and other areas where British English is used, the term aerial is sometimes used although '<a3_0>antenna<a3_0/>' has been universal in professional use for many years."}
