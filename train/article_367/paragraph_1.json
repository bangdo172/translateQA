An oscillating current of <a1_0>electrons<a1_0/> forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields <a2_0>radiate away<a2_0/> from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during <a3_0>reception<a3_0/>, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming radio wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna."}
