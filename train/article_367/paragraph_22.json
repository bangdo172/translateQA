At the <a1_0>resonant frequency<a1_0/>, the standing wave has a current peak and voltage node (minimum) at the feed. In electrical terms, this means the element has <a2_0>minimum reactance<a2_0/>, generating the maximum current for minimum voltage. This is the ideal situation, because it produces the maximum output for the minimum input, producing the highest possible efficiency. Contrary to an ideal (<a3_0>lossless<a3_0/>) series-resonant circuit, a finite resistance remains (corresponding to the relatively small voltage at the feed-point) due to the antenna's radiation resistance as well as any actual electrical losses."}
