Although an antenna may be designed to have a <a3_0>purely resistive feedpoint<a3_0/> impedance (such as a dipole 97% of a half wavelength long) this might not be exactly true at the frequency that it is eventually used at. In some cases the physical length of the antenna can be \"trimmed\" to obtain a pure resistance. On the other hand, the addition of a series inductance or <a2_0>parallel capacitance<a2_0/> can be used to cancel a residual capacitative or inductive reactance, respectively."}
