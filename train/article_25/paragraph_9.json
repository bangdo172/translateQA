The language of the Avesta is subdivided into <b5_0>two dialects<b5_0/>, conventionally known as \"Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan\", and \"Younger Avestan\". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as <a2_0>Rigvedic Sanskrit<a2_0/>. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as <a3_0>Old Persian<a3_0/>, but by virtue of <b7_0>its use as a sacred language<b7_0/> retained its \"old\" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage. Unlike <b8_0>Old Persian<b8_0/>, which has Middle Persian as its known successor, Avestan has no clearly identifiable Middle Iranian stage (the effect of Middle Iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes)."}
