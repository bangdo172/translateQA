Such hypothetical Old Iranian languages include <b2_0>Carduchi<b2_0/> (the hypothetical predecessor to <a0_0>Kurdish<a0_0/>) and Old Parthian. Additionally, <b3_0>the existence of unattested languages<b3_0/> can sometimes be inferred from the impact they had on neighbouring languages. Such transfer is known to have occurred for Old Persian, which has (what is called) a \"<b4_0>Median<b4_0/>\" substrate in some of its vocabulary. Also, foreign references to languages can also provide a hint to the existence of otherwise unattested languages, for example through toponyms/ethnonyms or in the recording of vocabulary, as <b5_0>Herodotus<b5_0/> did for what he called \"<a1_0>Scythian<a1_0/>\"."}
