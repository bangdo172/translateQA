The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed <b4_0>that <a0_0>our memories are constructed<b4_0/><a0_0/>. People can construct their memories <a1_0><b5_0>when they encode them and/or when they recall them<b5_0/>.<a1_0/> To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by <b7_0>Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer<b7_0/> (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit. There was no <a3_0>broken glass<a3_0/> depicted in the film. Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers\u2019 memories of the event. Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event \u2013 those who were asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen. The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated <a2_0><b6_0>that <b8_0>when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember<b8_0/><b6_0/>, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect."}
