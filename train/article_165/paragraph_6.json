The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. <a1_0><b5_0>It is out of cognitive control<b5_0/><a1_0/> and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \"see\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of <b7_0>sensory memory<b7_0/> were conducted by <a2_0><b6_0>George Sperling<b6_0/><a2_0/> (1963) using the \"partial report paradigm\". Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments,Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because <a3_0><b8_0>this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items<b8_0/><a3_0/> (12 in the \"whole report\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal."}
