Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment. Similarly, <b7_0>Garry and her colleagues<b7_0/> (1996) asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events. The <a2_0><b5_0>researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children<b5_0/><a2_0/>.
