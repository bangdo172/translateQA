He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later <a0_0><b4_0>research showed this to be false<b4_0/><a0_0/>. Research has shown that direct injections of <a1_0><b5_0>cortisol or epinephrine<b5_0/><a1_0/> help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that <a2_0><b6_0>excitement enhances memory<b6_0/><a2_0/> by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember <b7_0>emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones<b7_0/>. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The <a3_0>hippocampus<a3_0/> receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. <b8_0>Hippocampal<b8_0/> damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage. This memory loss includes, retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage."}
