Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. <a1_0><b5_0>Time-based prospective memories<b5_0/><a1_0/> are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor (action) at 4pm (cue). <a3_0>Event-based prospective memories<a3_0/> are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter (action) after seeing a mailbox (cue). <a2_0><b6_0>Cues<b6_0/><a2_0/> do not need to be related to the action (as the mailbox/letter example), and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory."}
