In response to stressful situations, the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters (ex. glucocorticoids and catecholamines) which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus. Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces <a1_0><b5_0>adrenal hormones<b5_0/><a1_0/> which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats. An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists <a2_0><b6_0>L. Schwabe and O. Wolf<b6_0/><a2_0/> demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans. In this study, 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group. Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water (the reputable SECPT or \u2018<b7_0>Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test<b7_0/>\u2019) for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped. Both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize. Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance). The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30% fewer words than the control group. The researchers suggest that <a3_0>stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process."}
