Its <a2_0>capacity is also very limited<a2_0/>: <b7_0>George A. Miller<b7_0/> (<b8_0>1956<b8_0/>), when working at Bell Laboratories, conducted experiments showing that the store of short-term memory was 7\u00b12 items (the title of his famous paper, \"The magical number 7\u00b12\"). Modern estimates of the capacity of short-term memory are lower, typically of the order of 4\u20135 items; however, memory capacity can be increased through a process called <a3_0>chunking.<a3_0/> For example, in recalling a ten-digit telephone number, a person could chunk the digits into <b9_0>three groups<b9_0/>: first, the area code (such as 123), then a three-digit chunk (456) and lastly a four-digit chunk (7890). This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is <a4_0>because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers<a4_0/>. This may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers."}
