Loss of memory is known as <a0_0><b5_0>amnesia<b5_0/>.<a0_0/> Amnesia can result from extensive damage to: (a) the regions of the medial temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, the parahippocampal, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortices or the (b) midline diencephalic region, specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus. <a3_0><b8_0>There are many sorts of amnesia<b8_0/>,<a3_0/> and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as <a1_0><b6_0>Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease<b6_0/><a1_0/> can also affect memory and cognition. Hyperthymesia, or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder that affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning <a4_0>that <b9_0>they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored<b9_0/><a4_0/>. Korsakoff's syndrome, also known as Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, is <a2_0><b7_0>an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex<b7_0/>."}
