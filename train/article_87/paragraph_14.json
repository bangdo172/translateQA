The report also cites concerns over potential cuts in the defence science and technology research budget; implications of inappropriate estimation of Defence Inflation within budgetary processes; underfunding in the <a2_0>Equipment Programme<a2_0/>; and a general concern over striking the appropriate balance over a short-term focus (Current Operations) and long-term consequences of failure to invest in the delivery of future UK defence capabilities on future combatants and campaigns. The then Secretary of State for Defence, <a3_0><b5_0>Bob Ainsworth<b5_0/> MP<a3_0/>, reinforced this reprioritisation of focus on current operations and had not ruled out <b9_0>\"major shifts\"<b9_0/> in defence spending. In the same article the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, Royal Navy, acknowledged that <b6_0>there was not enough money within the defence budget<b6_0/> and it is preparing itself for tough decisions and the potential for cutbacks. According to figures published by the <a4_0>London Evening Standard<a4_0/> the defence budget for 2009 is \"<b7_0>more than 10% overspent\"<b7_0/> (figures cannot be verified) and the paper states that this had caused Gordon Brown to say that the defence spending must be cut. The MoD has been investing in <b8_0>IT<b8_0/> to cut costs and improve services for its personnel."}
