The world's first institution of technology, <a0_0>the Berg-Schola<a0_0/> (today its legal successor is the University of Miskolc) was founded by the Court Chamber of Vienna in Selmecb\u00e1nya, Kingdom of Hungary in 1735 in order to train specialists of precious metal and copper mining according to the requirements of the industrial revolution in Hungary. The oldest German Institute of Technology is the Braunschweig University of Technology (founded in 1745 as \"<a2_0>Collegium Carolinum<a2_0/>\").
