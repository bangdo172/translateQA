For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of <a0_0><b5_0>AZT<b5_0/><a0_0/> for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by <a1_0><b6_0>monitoring the composition of patient blood samples<b6_0/><a1_0/>, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, <a2_0><b7_0>resources<b7_0/> could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk<a2_0/> in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific serological diagnostic identification, and later genotypic or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and <a3_0><b8_0>geographical origins of the virus<b8_0/><a3_0/>, as well as a myriad of other hypothesis. The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with anti-retroviral drugs. <a4_0><b9_0>Molecular diagnostics<b9_0/><a4_0/> are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection. Thus, while there still is no cure for AIDS, there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals, both for the patient and for the community at large."}
