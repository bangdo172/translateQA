These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to <a1_0><b6_0>bind specifically to an antigen<b6_0/><a1_0/>. The antigen, usually <a2_0><b7_0>a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent<b7_0/><a2_0/>, is bound by the antibody. This binding then sets off <a3_0><b8_0>a chain of events<b8_0/><a3_0/> that can be visibly obvious in various ways, dependent upon the test. For example, \"Strep throat\" is often diagnosed within minutes, and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent, <a4_0><b9_0>S. pyogenes<b9_0/><a4_0/>, that is retrieved from a patients throat with a cotton swab. Serological tests, if available, are usually the preferred route of identification, however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require refrigeration. Some serological methods are extremely costly, although when commonly used, such as with the \"strep test\", they can be inexpensive."}
