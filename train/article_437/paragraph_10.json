In a microbial culture, a <a1_0>growth<a1_0/> medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on <a2_0><b7_0>nutrient agar<b7_0/><a2_0/>, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for <b6_0>growth<b6_0/> of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called <a3_0><b8_0>a colony<b8_0/><a3_0/>, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \"lawn\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others. Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium. Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses: the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill. In the case of viral identification, a region of dead cells results from viral growth, and is called <a4_0><b9_0>a \"plaque\"<b9_0/><a4_0/>. Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent."}
