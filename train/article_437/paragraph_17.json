First, the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that <a2_0><b7_0>virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Second, an infectious agent must <a3_0><b8_0>grow within the human body<b8_0/><a3_0/> to cause disease; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease. This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR. Third, the essential tools for directing PCR, primers, are derived from the genomes of <a4_0><b9_0>infectious agents<b9_0/><a4_0/>, and with time those genomes will be known, if they are not already."}
