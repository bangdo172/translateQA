Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include <a1_0><b6_0>virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness<b6_0/><a1_0/>. The human strains of <a2_0>Ebola<a2_0/> virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone. Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its <a3_0><b8_0>victims experience only internal hemorrhaging<b8_0/><a3_0/>. As a result of the above features, the spread of <b7_0>Ebola<b7_0/> is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system. As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to <a4_0><b9_0>travel long distances<b9_0/><a4_0/>, increasing the likelihood of an epidemic."}
