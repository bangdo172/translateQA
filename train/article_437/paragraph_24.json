For instance, for genotype 1 <b5_0>hepatitis C<b5_0/> treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or <a1_0>Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b<a1_0/> (brand names Pegasys or PEG-Intron) combined with ribavirin, it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in the treatment-induced clearance of the virus. This finding, originally reported in Nature, showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more possibly to achieve <a2_0><b4_0>sustained virological response<b4_0/><a2_0/> after the treatment than others. Later report from Nature demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus."}
