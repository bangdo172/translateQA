Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in <a1_0>animals<a1_0/>, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in <a2_0><b7_0>embryonated<b7_0/><a2_0/> eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the <a3_0><b8_0>use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of <a4_0><b9_0>the causative agent<b9_0/><a4_0/>, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T. cruzi, an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected. The bug is later inspected for growth of T. cruzi within its gut."}
