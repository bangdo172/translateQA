Other types of infectious/transmissible/communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection, such as vector transmission or sexual transmission, are usually not regarded as \"contagious\", and often do not require <a3_0>medical<a3_0/> isolation (sometimes loosely called quarantine) of victims.
