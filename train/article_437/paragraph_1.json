These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis. Koch's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases <a3_0><b8_0>because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual<b8_0/><a3_0/> with a pathogen produced as a pure culture. Often, even clearly infectious diseases do not meet the infectious criteria. For example, <a4_0><b9_0>Treponema pallidum<b9_0/><a4_0/>, the causative spirochete of syphilis, cannot be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes. It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture. Epidemiology is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease outbreak is sporadic (occasional occurrence), endemic (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or pandemic (a global epidemic)."}
