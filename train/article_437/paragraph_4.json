All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by <a2_0><b6_0>extrinsic organisms<b6_0/><a2_0/>, and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host. An example of the former is the <a3_0><b9_0>anaerobic bacteria<b9_0/><a3_0/> species, which colonizes the mammalian colon, and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin. Neither of these colonizations are considered infections. The difference between an infection and a colonization is often <a4_0><b8_0>only a matter of circumstance<b8_0/><a4_0/>. Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions, and even the most virulent organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection. Some colonizing bacteria, such as Corynebacteria sp. and viridans streptococci, prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host, preventing infection and speeding wound healing."}
