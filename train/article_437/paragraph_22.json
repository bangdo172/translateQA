In epidemics, there are often <a1_0><b6_0>extensive interactions<b6_0/><a1_0/> within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if <b7_0>the main <a2_0>focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps<b7_0/><a2_0/> between hubs. The use of <a3_0><b8_0>needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users<b8_0/><a3_0/> with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method.  Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in <a4_0><b9_0>2001<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
