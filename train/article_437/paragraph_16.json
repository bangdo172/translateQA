Immunoassays can use the basic antibody \u2013 antigen binding as the basis to produce an <a1_0><b5_0>electro - magnetic or particle radiation<b5_0/><a1_0/> signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. <b6_0>Signal of <a2_0>unknowns can be compared to that of standards<b6_0/><a2_0/> allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins <a3_0><b7_0>generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent<b7_0/><a3_0/>. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus."}
