Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of <a1_0><b6_0>toxins<b6_0/><a1_0/> or destructive enzymes. For example, Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that <a2_0><b7_0>paralyzes muscles<b7_0/><a2_0/>, and <a3_0><b8_0>staphylococcus<b8_0/><a3_0/> releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis. Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts. For example, <a4_0>less than 5%<a4_0/> of individuals infected with polio develop disease. On the other hand, some infectious agents are highly virulent.
