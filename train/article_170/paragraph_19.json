The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu-men (pertaining to <a2_0>pitch<a2_0/>), and by others, pixtumens (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to bitumen, thence passing via <a3_0>French<a3_0/> into English. From the same root is derived the Anglo Saxon word cwidu (<a4_0><b8_0>mastix<b8_0/><a4_0/>), the German word Kitt (<b7_0><b9_0>cement or mastic<b9_0/><b7_0/>) and the old Norse word kvada."}
