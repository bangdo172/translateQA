It is obtained as the \"heavy\" (i.e., difficult to distill) fraction. Material with a boiling point greater than around <a1_0><b8_0>500 \u00b0C<b8_0/><a1_0/> is considered <b7_0>asphalt<b7_0/>. <a2_0>Vacuum distillation<a2_0/> separates it from the other components in crude oil (such as naphtha, gasoline and diesel). The resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications. In a <a4_0>de-asphalting<a4_0/> unit, the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules, which are then separated. Further processing is possible by \"<a3_0>blowing<a3_0/>\" the product: namely <b9_0>reacting it with oxygen<b9_0/>. This step makes the product harder and more viscous."}
