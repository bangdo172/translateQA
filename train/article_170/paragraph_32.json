Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an <a1_0>upgrading facility<a1_0/>. The <b9_0>process used to extract the <b7_0>bitumen<b7_0/> from the <b8_0>sand<b9_0/><b8_0/> is a hot water process originally developed by <a2_0>Dr. Karl Clark<a2_0/> of the University of Alberta during the <a3_0>1920s<a3_0/>. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over <a4_0>1 million barrels<a4_0/> (160\u00d710^3 m3) per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States."}
