This formation is from the <a2_0>early Cretaceous<a2_0/>, and is composed of numerous lenses of oil-bearing sand with up to 20% oil. Isotopic studies attribute the oil deposits to be about <a3_0>110 million years<a3_0/> old. Two smaller but still very large formations occur in the <b7_0>Peace River<b7_0/> oil sands and the <b8_0>Cold Lake<b8_0/> oil sands, to the west and southeast of the Athabasca oil sands, respectively. Of the Alberta bitumen deposits, only parts of the Athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining. The other <a4_0>80%<a4_0/> has to be produced by <b9_0>oil wells<b9_0/> using enhanced oil recovery techniques like steam-assisted gravity drainage."}
