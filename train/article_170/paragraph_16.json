These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form \"cutbacks\" with reduced melting point, or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt/bitumen into an <a0_0>emulsion<a0_0/>. Asphalt emulsions contain up to <a1_0>70%<a1_0/> <b6_0>asphalt/bitumen<b6_0/> and typically less than 1.5% <b7_0>chemical additives<b7_0/>. There are <b8_0>two<b8_0/> main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, <a2_0>cationic and anionic<a2_0/>. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to <a4_0>hot-mixed<a4_0/> asphalt, several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into <a3_0>recycled<a3_0/> hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements."}
