Asphalt is basically an inert material that must be <a2_0>heated or diluted<a2_0/> to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving, roofing, and other applications. In examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (<b8_0>IARC<b8_0/>) determined that it is the application parameters, predominantly <a4_0>temperature<a4_0/>, that effect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic hazard/risk of the asphalt emissions. In particular, temperatures <a3_0>greater than 199 \u00b0C<a3_0/> (390 \u00b0F), were shown to <b6_0>produce a greater exposure risk<b6_0/> than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures, such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement."}
