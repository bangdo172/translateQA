Because of oil price increases after <b7_0>2003<b7_0/>, producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By <b8_0><b9_0>2014<b9_0/><b8_0/>, Canadian crude asphalt/bitumen production averaged about 2.3 million barrels (370,000 m3) per day and was projected to rise to 4.4 million barrels (700,000 m3) per day by 2020.
