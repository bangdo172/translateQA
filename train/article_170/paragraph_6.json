Note that in <b8_0>French<b8_0/>, the term <a3_0>asphalte<a3_0/> is used for <b6_0>naturally occurring bitumen-soaked limestone deposits<b6_0/>, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the \"asphaltic concrete\" used to pave roads. It is a significant fact that the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects, and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application. Specifically <b7_0>Herodotus<b7_0/> mentioned that bitumen was brought to Babylon to build its gigantic fortification <a4_0>wall<a4_0/>. From the Greek, the word passed into late Latin, and thence into French (asphalte) and English (\"asphaltum\" and \"asphalt\")."}
