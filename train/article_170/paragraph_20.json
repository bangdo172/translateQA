During the early and mid-20th century when town gas was produced, <b9_0>coal tar<b9_0/> was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the <a1_0>binder<a1_0/> for road aggregates. The addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word <a2_0>tarmac<a2_0/>, which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the <b8_0>1970s<b8_0/>, when <a3_0>natural gas<a3_0/> succeeded town gas, asphalt/bitumen has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the La Brea Tar Pits and the Canadian oil sands, both of which actually contain natural <a4_0>bitumen<a4_0/> rather than tar. Pitch is another term sometimes used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen, as in Pitch Lake."}
