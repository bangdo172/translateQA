Only two roads, Interstate 5 and State Route 99 (both limited-access highways), run uninterrupted through the city from north to south. State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on the <a1_0>Alaskan Way Viaduct<a1_0/>, which was built in 1953. However, due to damage sustained during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a <a2_0>tunnel<a2_0/>. The 2-mile (3.2 km) Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel was originally scheduled to be completed in December 2015 at a cost of US<a3_0>$4.25 billion<a3_0/>. Unfortunately, due to issues with the worlds largest tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is nicknamed \"Bertha\" and is 57 feet (17 m) in diameter, the projected date of completion has been pushed back to <a4_0>2017<a4_0/>. Seattle has the 8th worst traffic congestion of all American cities, and is 10th among all North American cities."}
