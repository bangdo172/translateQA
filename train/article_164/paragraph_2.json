Charles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and reestablished their old land claim and called it \"<a1_0>New York<a1_0/>\", but renamed \"<a2_0>New York Alki<a2_0/>\" in <a4_0>April 1853<a4_0/>, from a Chinook word meaning, roughly, \"by and by\" or \"someday\". For the next few years, <a3_0>New York Alki<a3_0/> and Duwamps competed for dominance, but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers."}
