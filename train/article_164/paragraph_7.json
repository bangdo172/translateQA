His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival <a2_0>John Considine<a2_0/>, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. <a3_0>B. Marcus Priteca<a3_0/>, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the Pantages name; Seattle's surviving <a4_0>Paramount Theatre<a4_0/>, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater."}
