Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the Seattle <a4_0>trolleybus<a4_0/> system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region."}
