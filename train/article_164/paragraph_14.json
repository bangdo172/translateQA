On <a2_0>February 28, 2001<a2_0/>, the magnitude <a1_0>6.8<a1_0/> Nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage, especially in the Pioneer Square area (built on <a4_0>reclaimed land<a4_0/>, as are the Industrial District and part of the city center), but caused only one fatality. Other strong quakes occurred on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9 magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly, and one more by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault passes just south of the city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude <a3_0>9.0 or greater<a3_0/>, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill."}
