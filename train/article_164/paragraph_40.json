Like much of the Pacific Northwest (which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of <a3_0>atheism<a3_0/>), church attendance, religious belief, and political influence of religious leaders are <a4_0>much lower<a4_0/> than in other parts of America."}
