In 2006, after growing by 4,000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by <a0_0>200,000<a0_0/> people by 2040. However, former mayor <a1_0>Greg Nickels<a1_0/> supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000 people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle's single-family housing zoning laws. The Seattle City Council later voted to relax <a4_0>height limits<a4_0/> on buildings in the greater part of Downtown, partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city centre. As a sign of increasing inner-city growth, the downtown population crested to over <a3_0>60,000<a3_0/> in 2009, up <a2_0>77%<a2_0/> since 1990."}
