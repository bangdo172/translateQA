Seattle's current official nickname is the \"<a0_0>Emerald City<a0_0/>\", the result of a contest held in 1981; the reference is to the lush <a1_0>evergreen forests<a1_0/> of the area. Seattle is also referred to informally as the \"<a2_0>Gateway to Alaska<a2_0/>\" for being the nearest major city in the contiguous US to Alaska, \"Rain City\" for its frequent cloudy and rainy weather, and \"Jet City\" from the local influence of <a3_0>Boeing<a3_0/>. The city has two official slogans or mottos: \"The City of Flowers\", meant to encourage the planting of flowers to beautify the city, and \"<a4_0>The City of Goodwill<a4_0/>\", adopted prior to the 1990 Goodwill Games. Seattle residents are known as Seattleites."}
