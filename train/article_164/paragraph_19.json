In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both <a1_0>streams of air<a1_0/> originate over the <a2_0>Pacific Ocean<a2_0/>; airflow is split by the <a3_0>Olympic Mountains<a3_0/> to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The <a4_0>Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm<a4_0/> in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to 69 mph (111 km/h), an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest."}
