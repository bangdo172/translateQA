To a liberal, a slave who is not interfered with <b4_0>may be free<b4_0/>, yet to a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian Quentin Skinner, jurist Cass Sunstein, and political philosopher Philip Pettit. <a2_0>The capability approach<a2_0/>, pioneered by economists Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen and further developed by legal scholar Martha Nussbaum, <b5_0>understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act<b5_0/>. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as <b6_0>something which must be resourced<b6_0/>. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it."}
