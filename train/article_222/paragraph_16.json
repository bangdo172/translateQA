In general, there was a marked trend towards a <a1_0><b5_0>pragmatic approach<b5_0/><a1_0/> to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply utilitarianism to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) <b8_0>to apply economic models (such as rational choice theory) to political issues<b8_0/>.
