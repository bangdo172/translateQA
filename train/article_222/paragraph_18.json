Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the <a0_0>Frankfurt School,<a0_0/> thinkers like <b3_0>Herbert Marcuse, Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and J\u00fcrgen Habermas<b3_0/> combined <b4_0>Marxian and <a1_0>Freudian<a1_0/> perspectives<b4_0/>. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers\u2014still largely influenced by <b5_0>Marxism<b5_0/>\u2014put new emphases on structuralism and on a \"return to Hegel\". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Claude Lefort, and Jean Baudrillard. The Situationists were more influenced by Hegel; <a2_0><b6_0>Guy Debord<b6_0/><a2_0/>, in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of commodity fetishism to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation."}
