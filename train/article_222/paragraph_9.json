The term \"<a1_0><b5_0>government<b5_0/><a1_0/>\" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science, although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that <b12_0>most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states<b12_0/> that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of natural order was not introduced, the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, <b9_0>society has been considered subject to <b7_0>natural laws akin to <a2_0>the physical world<b9_0/><b7_0/><a2_0/>."}
