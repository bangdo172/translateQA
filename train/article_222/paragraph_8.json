That work, as well as <b6_0>The Discourses<b6_0/>, a rigorous analysis of the classical period, did <b11_0>much to influence modern political thought in the West<b11_0/>. A minority (including Jean-Jacques Rousseau) interpreted <b7_0>The Prince<b7_0/> as a satire meant to be given to <b12_0>the Medici<b12_0/> after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence. Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported <b13_0>the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family<b13_0/>. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end\u2014i.e., the secure and powerful state. <a3_0><b8_0>Thomas Hobbes<b8_0/><a3_0/>, well known for his theory of the social contract, goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the English Renaissance. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order."}
