Philosophers such as <b7_0>Confucius<b7_0/>, Mencius, and Mozi, focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, meritocratic government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws. <a3_0>Mohism<a3_0/> advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism. The <b8_0>Agrarians<b8_0/> advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. Taoism advocated a proto-anarchism.
