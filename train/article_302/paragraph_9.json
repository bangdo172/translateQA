The ensuing <a0_0>1924<a0_0/> general election saw the publication, four days before polling day, of the <b4_0>Zinoviev<b4_0/> letter, in which <b5_0>Moscow<b5_0/> talked about a Communist revolution in Britain. The <b6_0>letter<b6_0/> had little impact on the Labour vote\u2014which held up. It was the collapse of the Liberal party that led to the Conservative landslide. The Conservatives were returned to power although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% to a third of the popular vote, most Conservative gains being at the expense of the Liberals. However many Labourites for years blamed their defeat on foul play (the Zinoviev Letter), thereby according to A. J. P. Taylor misunderstanding the political forces at work and delaying needed reforms in the party."}
