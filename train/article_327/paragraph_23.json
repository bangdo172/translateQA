It is also equivalent to mass, and this mass is always associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a <a1_0><b6_0>certain amount of energy<b6_0/><a1_0/>, and likewise always appears associated with it, as described in mass-energy equivalence. The formula <a4_0><b9_0>E = mc\u00b2<b9_0/><a4_0/>, derived by <a2_0><b7_0>Albert Einstein<b7_0/><a2_0/> (<a3_0><b8_0>1905<b8_0/><a3_0/>) quantifies the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by J. J. Thomson (1881), Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1900), Friedrich Hasen\u00f6hrl (1904) and others (see Mass-energy equivalence#History for further information)."}
