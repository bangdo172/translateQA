The \"ability of a system to perform work\" is a common description, but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms. For instance, in SI units, <b4_0>energy<b4_0/> is measured in <a1_0>joules<a1_0/>, and one joule is defined \"mechanically\", being <a2_0>the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of <b6_0>1 metre<b6_0/> against a force of 1 newton<a2_0/>.[note 1] However, there are many other definitions of <b5_0>energy<b5_0/>, depending on the context, such as <b7_0>thermal energy, radiant energy, electromagnetic, nuclear<b7_0/>, etc., where definitions are derived that are the most convenient."}
