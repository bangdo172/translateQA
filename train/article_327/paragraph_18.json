All <a0_0><b4_0>stellar phenomena<b4_0/><a0_0/> (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The <a1_0><b5_0>nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun<b5_0/><a1_0/> also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the <a2_0><b6_0>Big Bang<b6_0/><a2_0/>. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by <a3_0><b7_0>fusion<b7_0/><a3_0/>. Such a <b8_0>fusion process<b8_0/> is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight."}
