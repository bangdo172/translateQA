For example, classical mechanics distinguishes between <a0_0><b3_0>kinetic energy<b3_0/><a0_0/>, which is determined by an object's movement through space, and <a2_0><b5_0>potential energy<b5_0/><a2_0/>, which is a function of the position of an object within a field. It may also be convenient to distinguish gravitational energy, <b4_0>thermal energy<b4_0/>, several types of nuclear energy (which utilize potentials from the nuclear force and the weak force), electric energy (from the electric field), and magnetic energy (from the magnetic field), among others. Many of these classifications overlap; for instance, <a1_0><b7_0>thermal energy<a1_0/> usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential energy<b7_0/>."}
