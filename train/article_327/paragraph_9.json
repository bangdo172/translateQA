This formalism is as fundamental as the <b8_0>Hamiltonian<b8_0/>, and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them. It was invented in the context of classical mechanics, but is generally useful in modern physics. The <a2_0><b6_0>Lagrangian<b6_0/><a2_0/> is defined as the kinetic energy minus the potential energy. Usually, the <a3_0><b7_0>Lagrange formalism<b7_0/><a3_0/> is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction)."}
