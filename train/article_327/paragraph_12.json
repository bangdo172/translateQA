Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. <a1_0><b5_0>Energy<b5_0/><a1_0/> is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins, which release energy when reacted with oxygen in respiration. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (<a2_0><b6_0>Human energy conversion<b6_0/><a2_0/>) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 \u00f7 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the <a3_0><b7_0>746<b7_0/> watts<a3_0/> in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps <b8_0>1,000<b8_0/> watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum. The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a \"feel\" for the use of a given amount of energy."}
