In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. <a0_0>The <b3_0>second law of thermodynamics<b3_0/><a0_0/> states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (\"the surroundings\").[note 3] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy <a2_0><b7_0>ecological niches<b7_0/><a2_0/> that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a <b5_0>metabolic pathway<b5_0/> is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in <b6_0>ecology<b6_0/>: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat."}
