This means that it is impossible to create or destroy energy. While <a2_0><b6_0>heat<b6_0/><a2_0/> can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in heat engines the <a3_0><b7_0>second law of thermodynamics<b7_0/><a3_0/> states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat. This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the <a1_0><b5_0>available energy<b5_0/><a1_0/>. Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into thermal energy without such limitations. The total energy of a system can be calculated <a0_0><b4_0>by adding up all forms of energy in the system<b4_0/><a0_0/>."}
