This is a reversible process \u2013 the inverse process is called <a1_0><a2_0><b4_0>pair creation<b4_0/><a2_0/><a1_0/> \u2013 in which the rest mass of particles is created from energy of two (or more) annihilating photons. In this system the matter (<b6_0>electrons and positrons<b6_0/>) <b5_0>is destroyed and changed to non-matter energy<b5_0/> (<b7_0>the photons<b7_0/>). However, the total system mass and energy do not change during this interaction."}
