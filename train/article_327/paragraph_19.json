Its results can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. <a2_0>The Schr\u00f6dinger equation<a2_0/> describes the space- and time-dependence of a slowly changing (non-relativistic) wave function of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is <b6_0>discrete<b6_0/> (<b5_0>a set of permitted states, each characterized by an energy level<b5_0/>) which results in the concept of quanta. In the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by Planck's relation:  (where  is Planck's constant and  the frequency). In the case of an electromagnetic wave these <b7_0>energy states<b7_0/> are called quanta of light or photons."}
