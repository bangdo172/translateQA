Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse. <a1_0><b6_0>Chemical reactions<b6_0/><a1_0/> are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy. The speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the <a3_0><b8_0>Boltzmann's<b8_0/><a3_0/> population factor <a2_0><b7_0>e\u2212E/kT<b7_0/><a2_0/> \u2013 that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the <a4_0><b9_0>Arrhenius equation<b9_0/><a4_0/>.The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of thermal energy."}
