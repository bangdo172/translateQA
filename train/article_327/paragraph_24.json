However, since  is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of ordinary amount of matter (for example, 1 kg) to other forms of energy (such as heat, light, and other radiation) can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~ <b8_0>joules<b8_0/> = 21 megatons of TNT), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the <a2_0><b6_0>mass equivalent of a unit of energy is minuscule<b6_0/><a2_0/>, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure by weight, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of energy transformation into matter (i.e., kinetic energy into particles with rest mass) are found in <a3_0><b7_0>high-energy nuclear physics<b7_0/><a3_0/>."}
