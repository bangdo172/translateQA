As shown rigorously by <a0_0><b4_0>Noether's theorem<b4_0/><a0_0/>, the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of translational symmetry of time, a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because <a1_0><b5_0>energy<b5_0/><a1_0/> is the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in <a2_0><b6_0>the <a3_0><b7_0>uncertainty principle<b7_0/><b6_0/><a3_0/><a2_0/> - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with <b8_0>energy conservation<b8_0/> - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured."}
