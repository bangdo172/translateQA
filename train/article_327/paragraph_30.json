The portion of the energy which is transferred by conservative forces over a distance is measured as the work the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called <a1_0><b4_0>heat<b4_0/><a1_0/>.[note 4] Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples include the <a2_0><b5_0>transmission of electromagnetic energy via <b7_0>photons<b7_0/><b5_0/><a2_0/>, physical collisions which transfer kinetic energy,[note 5] and the conductive transfer of <b6_0>thermal<b6_0/> energy."}
