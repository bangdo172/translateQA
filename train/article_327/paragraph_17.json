This <a2_0><b6_0>thermal energy<b6_0/><a2_0/> drives plate tectonics and may lift mountains, via orogenesis.

Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or <a3_0><b7_0>elastic strain<b7_0/><a3_0/> (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created <b8_0>these atoms<b8_0/>."}
