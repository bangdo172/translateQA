(<a0_0>2005<a0_0/>), Cruciani et al. (2004, 2007), the Somalis are paternally closely related to other <a1_0>Afro-Asiatic<a1_0/>-speaking groups in Northeast Africa. Besides comprising the majority of the Y-DNA in Somalis, the <a2_0>E1b1b1a<a2_0/> (formerly E3b1a) haplogroup also makes up a significant proportion of the paternal DNA of Ethiopians, Sudanese, Egyptians, Berbers, North African Arabs, as well as many Mediterranean populations. Sanchez et al. (2005) observed the M78 subclade of E1b1b in about <a4_0>77%<a4_0/> of their Somali male samples. According to Cruciani et al. (2007), the presence of this subhaplogroup in the Horn region may represent the traces of an ancient migration from <a3_0>Egypt/Libya<a3_0/>. After haplogroup E1b1b, the second most frequently occurring Y-DNA haplogroup among Somalis is the West Asian haplogroup T (M70). It is observed in slightly more than 10% of Somali males. Haplogroup T, like haplogroup E1b1b, is also typically found among populations of Northeast Africa, North Africa, the Near East and the Mediterranean."}
