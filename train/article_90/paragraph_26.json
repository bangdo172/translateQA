They provide Islamic education for children, thereby filling a clear religious and social role in the country. Known as the most stable local, non-formal system of education providing basic religious and moral instruction, their strength rests on community support and their use of locally made and widely available teaching materials. The Qur'anic system, which teaches the greatest number of students relative to other educational sub-sectors, is oftentimes the only system accessible to Somalis in nomadic as compared to urban areas. A study from 1993 found, among other things, that \"unlike in primary schools where gender disparity is enormous, around <a1_0>40<a1_0/> per cent of Qur'anic school pupils are girls; but the teaching staff have minimum or no qualification necessary to ensure intellectual development of children.\" To address these concerns, the Somali government on its own part subsequently established <a2_0>the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs<a2_0/>, under which Qur'anic education is now regulated."}
