It is usually made out of <a1_0>alandi<a1_0/>, which is a textile common in the Horn region and some parts of North Africa. The garment can be worn in different styles. It can also be made with other fabrics, including white cloth with gold borders. For more formal settings, such as at weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear <a2_0>the dirac<a2_0/>. It is a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of silk, chiffon, <a3_0>taffeta<a3_0/> or saree fabric. The gown is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere. Known as <a4_0>the gorgorad<a4_0/>, the underskirt is made out of silk and serves as a key part of the overall outfit. The dirac is usually sparkly and very colorful, the most popular styles being those with gilded borders or threads. The fabric is typically acquired from Somali clothing stores in tandem with the gorgorad. In the past, dirac fabric was also frequently purchased from South Asian merchandisers."}
