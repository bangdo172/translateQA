The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. There was also widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls. The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, <a2_0>Vice President of the Government Council<a2_0/>. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later. Djibouti finally gained its independence from France in <a3_0>1977<a3_0/>, and <a4_0>Hassan Gouled Aptidon<a4_0/>, a Somali who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, eventually wound up as Djibouti's first president (1977\u20131991)."}
