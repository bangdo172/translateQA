The script was developed by the Somali linguist <a3_0>Shire Jama Ahmed<a3_0/> specifically for the Somali language, and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except p, v and z. Besides Ahmed's Latin script, other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing Somali include the long-established Arabic script and Wadaad's writing.
