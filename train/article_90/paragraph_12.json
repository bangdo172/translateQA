The imperial clouds wavering over Somalia alarmed the Dervish leader Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, who gathered Somali soldiers from across the Horn of Africa and began one of the longest anti-colonial wars ever. The Dervish State successfully repulsed the British empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region. As a result of its successes against the British, the Dervish State received support from <a0_0>the Ottoman and German empires<a0_0/>. The Turks also named Hassan Emir of the Somali nation, and the Germans promised to officially recognize any territories the Dervishes were to acquire. After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the Dervishes were finally defeated in <a1_0>1920<a1_0/>, when Britain for the first time in Africa used airplanes to bomb the Dervish capital of <a2_0>Taleex<a2_0/>. As a result of this bombardment, former Dervish territories were turned into a protectorate of Britain. Italy similarly faced the same opposition from Somali Sultans and armies and did not acquire full control of parts of modern Somalia until the Fascist era in late <a3_0>1927<a3_0/>. This occupation lasted till <a4_0>1941<a4_0/> and was replaced by a British military administration."}
