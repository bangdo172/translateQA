According to an extreme empiricist theory known as phenomenalism, anticipated by the arguments of both <b5_0>Hume and George Berkeley<b5_0/>, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences. <a3_0>Phenomenalism<a3_0/> is the view that <a2_0>physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events<a2_0/>. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist \u2014 hence the closely related term subjective idealism. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences. This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As John Stuart Mill put it in the <b6_0><b8_0>mid-19th century<b8_0/><b6_0/>, matter is <a4_0>the \"permanent possibility of sensation\"<a4_0/>. Mill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for all meaningful knowledge including mathematics. As summarized by D.W.
