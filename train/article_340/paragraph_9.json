In response to <b7_0>Locke<b7_0/>, he put forth in his Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (<a1_0><b5_0>1710<b5_0/><a1_0/>) an important challenge to empiricism in which things only exist either as a result of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.) In his text Alciphron, Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of <b8_0>God<b8_0/>. Berkeley's approach to empiricism would later come to be called subjective idealism."}
