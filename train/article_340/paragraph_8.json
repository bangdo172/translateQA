Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a \"<a2_0>blank tablet<a2_0/>\", in Locke's words \"<a3_0>white paper<a3_0/>\", <a4_0>on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written<a4_0/>. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. <b9_0>If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple<b9_0/>. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is <b5_0>a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other<b5_0/>, which is very different from the quest for certainty of <b8_0>Descartes<b8_0/>."}
