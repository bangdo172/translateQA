If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, <b7_0>the former must be at least deducible from the latter<b7_0/>. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched <a1_0>in <b5_0>purely sensory terms<b5_0/><a1_0/> and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal. But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to <a2_0>a second doctor<a2_0/> who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, <b6_0>we must refer to a third doctor<b6_0/>, and so on (also see the third man)."}
