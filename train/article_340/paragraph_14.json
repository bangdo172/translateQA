The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between <a1_0>actual and possible sensations<a1_0/>. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\" might exist in the first place. <b7_0>Berkeley<b7_0/> put <a2_0><b5_0>God<b5_0/><a2_0/> in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \"reality\" that goes beyond mere \"possibilities of sensation\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \"<a3_0>gap-filling entities<a3_0/> are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider <a4_0><b8_0>the structure and method of mathematical science<b8_0/>, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures<a4_0/> which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction."}
