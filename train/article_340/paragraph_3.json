For <b7_0>Avicenna<b7_0/> (Ibn Sina), for example, the tabula rasa is a <b6_0>pure potentiality that is actualized through education<b6_0/>, and knowledge is attained through \"empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts\" developed through a \"syllogistic method of reasoning in which observations lead to propositional statements which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts\". The intellect itself develops from a <a2_0><b9_0>material intellect<b9_0/><a2_0/> (al-'aql al-hayulani), which is a potentiality \"that can acquire knowledge to the <a3_0>active intellect<a3_0/> (<b8_0>al-'aql al-fa'il<b8_0/>), the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge\". So <a4_0>the immaterial \"active intellect\"<a4_0/>, separate from any individual person, is still essential for understanding to occur."}
