The Italian word he used for \"<a3_0>experiment<a3_0/>\" was esperienza. It is known that he was the essential pedagogical influence upon the young Galileo, his eldest son (cf. <b6_0>Coelho<b6_0/>, ed. Music and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei), arguably one of the most influential empiricists in history. Vincenzo, through his tuning research, found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of 'Pythagoras' hammers' (the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals, not the actual numbers, as believed), and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities, a radically empirical attitude developed, passed on to Galileo, which regarded \"experience and demonstration\" as the sine qua non of valid rational enquiry."}
