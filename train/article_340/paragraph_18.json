In later years, <a3_0>Carnap and Neurath<a3_0/> abandoned this sort of phenomenalism in favor of a rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics. That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called protocol sentences, for example, \"X at location Y and at time T observes such and such.\" The central theses of <b8_0>logical positivism<b8_0/> (verificationism, the analytic-synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack <b6_0>after <b7_0>World War II<b7_0/><b6_0/> by thinkers such as <a1_0>Nelson Goodman, W.V. Quine, Hilary Putnam, Karl Popper, and Richard Rorty<a1_0/>. By <b5_0>the late 1960s<b5_0/>, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement had pretty much run its course, though its influence is still significant among contemporary analytic philosophers such as Michael Dummett and other <a2_0>anti-realists<a2_0/>."}
