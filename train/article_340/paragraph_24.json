The role of sense experience in Dewey's theory is crucial, in that <b8_0>he saw experience as unified totality of things<b8_0/> through which everything else is interrelated. Dewey's basic thought, in accordance with empiricism was that <a1_0><b6_0>reality is determined <b5_0>by past experience<b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/>. Therefore, humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience. The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically, and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation, in physical sciences as in ethics. Thus, ideas in Dewey's system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known a posteriori."}
