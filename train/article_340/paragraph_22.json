First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street. That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses. Hence, <b8_0>if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses<b8_0/>, and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference, its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique \u2013 in a word, incorrigible. This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its <a2_0>unique individuality or \"thisness\"<a2_0/> \u2013 what the Scholastics called its haecceity \u2013 that stands beyond control and correction. Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them. This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals <a4_0>in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research<a4_0/>, most recently for instance with the work of Irvin Rock on <a3_0>indirect perception<a3_0/>."}
