To this, Peirce added the concept of abductive reasoning. The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today. Peirce's approach \"presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them. According to <b7_0>Peirce<b7_0/>'s doctrine of fallibilism, <a3_0>the conclusions of science are always tentative<a3_0/>. The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions, but on <a4_0>its self-corrective character<a4_0/>: by <b8_0>continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes<b8_0/>, and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth\"."}
