They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by <b8_0>Frege (<b6_0>1848<b6_0/>\u2013<b7_0>1925<b7_0/>) and Bertrand Russell (<a0_0><b5_0>1872<b5_0/><a0_0/>\u2013<a1_0>1970<a1_0/>)<b8_0/> a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that <a2_0>all mathematical truths are logical<a2_0/> with the early Wittgenstein's idea that <a3_0>all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies<a3_0/>, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called <b9_0>verification principle<b9_0/>. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, <a4_0>most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems<a4_0/> came to be considered pseudoproblems."}
