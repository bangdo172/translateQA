James maintained that <b8_0>the empirically observed \"directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous trans-empirical connective support\"<b8_0/>, by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any value added by seeking supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. James's \"<b6_0>radical empiricism<b6_0/>\" is thus not radical in the context of the term \"empiricism\", <b5_0>but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term \"empirical\"<b5_0/>. (His method of argument in arriving at this view, however, still readily encounters debate within philosophy even today.)"}
