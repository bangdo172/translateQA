The halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished <b5_0>by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during <a1_0>meiosis<b5_0/><a1_0/>. In haploid organisms, including cells of bacteria, archaea, and in organelles including <a2_0>mitochondria and chloroplasts<a2_0/>, or viruses, that similarly contain genes, the single or set of circular or linear chains of DNA (or RNA for some viruses), likewise constitute the genome. The term genome can be applied specifically to mean <b6_0>what is stored on a complete set of nuclear DNA<b6_0/> (i.e., the \"nuclear genome\") but can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own DNA, as with the \"mitochondrial genome\" or the \"chloroplast genome\".
