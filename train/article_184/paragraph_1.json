In August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and\u2014by agreement with the United States\u2014occupied Korea <a1_0>north of the 38th parallel<a1_0/>. <a2_0>U.S. forces<a2_0/> subsequently occupied the south and <a0_0>Japan<a0_0/> surrendered. By 1948, two separate governments had been set up. Both governments claimed to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepted the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces\u2014supported by the Soviet Union and China\u2014invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950. On that day, the <a3_0>United Nations Security Council<a3_0/> recognized this North Korean act as invasion and called for an immediate ceasefire. On 27 June, the Security Council adopted S/RES/83: Complaint of aggression upon the Republic of Korea and decided the formation and dispatch of the UN Forces in Korea. <a4_0>Twenty-one<a4_0/> countries of the United Nations eventually contributed to the defense of South Korea, with the United States providing 88% of the UN's military personnel."}
