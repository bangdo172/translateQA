The Soviets had detonated their first nuclear bomb in September <a0_0>1949<a0_0/>; American soldiers had fully withdrawn from Korea; the Americans had not intervened to stop the communist victory in China, and <a3_0>Stalin<a3_0/> calculated that the Americans would be even less willing to fight in Korea\u2014which had seemingly much less strategic significance. The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the US to communicate with the <a2_0>US<a2_0/> embassy in Moscow, and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation. Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in <a4_0>Asia<a4_0/> based on these developments, including promising economic and military aid to China through the <a1_0>Sino\u2013Soviet Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance Treaty<a1_0/>."}
