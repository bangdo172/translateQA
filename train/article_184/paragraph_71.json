USS Juneau later sank several ammunition ships that had been present. The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at <a3_0>Inchon<a3_0/>, days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship PC-703 sank a North Korean mine layer in the Battle of Haeju Island, near Inchon. Three other supply ships were sunk by PC-703 two days later in the Yellow Sea. Thereafter, vessels from <a1_0>the UN nations<a1_0/> held undisputed control of the sea about Korea. The gun ships were used in shore bombardment, while the aircraft carriers provided air support to the ground forces."}
