The PVA marched \"dark-to-dark\" (<a4_0>19:00\u201303:00<a4_0/>), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30. Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site. During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to <a1_0>remain motionless<a1_0/> if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away; PVA officers were under order to <a3_0>shoot security violators<a3_0/>. Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-division army to march the 286 miles (460 km) from An-tung, Manchuria, to the combat zone in some <a2_0>19<a2_0/> days. Another division night-marched a circuitous mountain route, averaging 18 miles (29 km) daily for 18 days."}
