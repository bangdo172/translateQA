There was considerable resistance among many leaders, including senior military leaders, to confronting the U.S. in Korea. <a1_0>Mao<a1_0/> strongly supported intervention, and Zhou was one of the few Chinese leaders who firmly supported him. After Lin Biao politely refused Mao's offer to command Chinese forces in Korea (citing his upcoming medical treatment), Mao decided that <a2_0>Peng Dehuai<a2_0/> would be the commander of the Chinese forces in Korea after Peng agreed to support Mao's position. Mao then asked <a3_0>Peng<a3_0/> to speak in favor of intervention to the rest of the Chinese leaders. After Peng made the case that if U.S. troops conquered Korea and reached the Yalu they might cross it and invade China the Politburo agreed to intervene in Korea. Later, the Chinese claimed that US bombers had violated PRC national airspace on three separate occasions and attacked Chinese targets before China intervened. On 8 October 1950, Mao Zedong redesignated the PLA North East Frontier Force as the Chinese <a4_0>People's Volunteer Army<a4_0/> (PVA)."}
