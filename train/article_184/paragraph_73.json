The fast, heavily armed MiG outflew first-generation UN jets such as the F-80 (United States Air Force) and Gloster Meteors (Royal Australian Air Force), posing a real threat to B-29 Superfortress bombers even under fighter escort. Fearful of confronting the United States directly, <a0_0>the Soviet Union<a0_0/> denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role, but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots <a3_0>dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian<a3_0/>. This known direct Soviet participation was a casus belli that the <a1_0>UN Command<a1_0/> deliberately overlooked, lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand to include the <a4_0>Soviet Union<a4_0/>, and potentially escalate into <a2_0>atomic warfare<a2_0/>."}
