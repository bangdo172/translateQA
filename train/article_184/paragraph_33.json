The United States Air Force (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges, halting most daytime road and rail traffic. KPA forces were forced <a1_0>to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night<a1_0/>. To deny mat\u00e9riel to the <a0_0>KPA<a0_0/>, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, petroleum refineries, and harbors, while the U.S. Navy air forces attacked transport hubs. Consequently, the over-extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south. On 27 August, 67th Fighter Squadron <a2_0>aircraft mistakenly attacked facilities in Chinese territory<a2_0/> and the Soviet Union called the UN Security Council's attention to China's complaint about the incident. The US proposed that a commission of India and <a3_0>Sweden<a3_0/> determine what the US should pay in compensation but <a4_0>the Soviets vetoed the US proposal<a4_0/>."}
