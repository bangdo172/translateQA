This military decision made solely by China changed the attitude of the <a1_0>Soviet Union<a1_0/>. Twelve days after Chinese troops entered the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported more aid to China. After decimating the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong, the first confrontation between Chinese and U.S. military occurred on <a2_0>1 November 1950<a2_0/>; deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the U.S. 8th Cavalry Regiment with three-prong assaults\u2014from the north, northwest, and west\u2014and overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan. The surprise assault resulted in the UN forces retreating back to the <a3_0>Ch'ongch'on River<a3_0/>, while the <a4_0>Chinese unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts<a4_0/> following victory. It is unclear why the Chinese did not press the attack and follow up their victory."}
