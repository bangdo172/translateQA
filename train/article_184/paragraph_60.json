The offensive's first thrust fell upon I Corps, which fiercely resisted in the Battle of the Imjin River (22\u201325 April 1951) and the Battle of Kapyong (22\u201325 April 1951), blunting the impetus of the offensive, which was halted at the \"No-name Line\" north of Seoul. On 15 May 1951, the Chinese commenced the second impulse of the Spring Offensive and attacked the ROK Army and the U.S. X Corps in the east at the Soyang River. After initial success, they were halted by 20 May. At month's end, the U.S. Eighth Army counterattacked and regained \"Line Kansas\", <a4_0>just north of the 38th parallel<a4_0/>.
