For example, the Cork South Link dual carriageway was built in <b8_0>the early <a0_0><b4_0>1980s<b8_0/><a0_0/>,<b4_0/> <a1_0>to link the Kinsale Road roundabout with the <b5_0>city centre<b5_0/><a1_0/>. Shortly afterwards, the first sections of the South Ring dual carriageway were opened. Work continued through the 1990s on extending the N25 South Ring Road, with the opening of the <b6_0>Jack Lynch Tunnel<b6_0/> under the River Lee being a significant addition. The Kinsale Road flyover opened in August 2006 <b9_0>to <a2_0>remove a bottleneck<b9_0/> <b10_0>for traffic heading to Cork Airport or Killarney<b10_0/><a2_0/>. Other projects completed at this time include the N20 Blackpool bypass and the N20 Cork to Mallow road projects. The N22 Ballincollig dual carriageway bypass, which links to the Western end of the Cork Southern Ring road was opened in September 2004. City Centre road improvements include the Patrick Street project - which reconstructed the street with a <a3_0><b12_0>pedestrian focus<b12_0/><a3_0/>. The <b7_0>M8 motorway<b7_0/> links Cork with <b11_0>Dublin<b11_0/>."}
