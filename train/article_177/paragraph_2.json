The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica lists the same bird groups but also includes <a0_0><b9_0>guinea fowl<b9_0/> and <b5_0>squabs<b5_0/> (young pigeons)<a0_0/>. In <a1_0><b10_0>R. D. Crawford<b10_0/><a1_0/>'s <b6_0>Poultry breeding and genetics<b6_0/>, squabs are omitted but <b11_0>Japan<b11_0/>ese quail and common pheasant are added to the list, the latter <a2_0>frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild.<a2_0/> In his 1848 classic book on poultry, <b7_0>Ornamental and Domestic Poultry: Their History, and Management<b7_0/>, <b13_0>Edmund Dixon<b13_0/> included chapters on the <a3_0>peafowl, guinea fowl, mute swan, turkey, various types of geese, the muscovy duck, other ducks and all types of chickens including bantams<a3_0/>. In colloquial speech, the term \"fowl\" is often used near-synonymously with \"domesticated chicken\" (<b8_0>Gallus gallus<b8_0/>), or with \"poultry\" or even just \"bird\", and <a4_0>many languages do not distinguish between \"poultry\" and \"<b12_0>fowl<b12_0/><a4_0/>\". Both words are also used for the flesh of these birds. Poultry can be distinguished from \"game\", defined as wild birds or mammals hunted for food or sport, a word also used to describe the flesh of these when eaten."}
