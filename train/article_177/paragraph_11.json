The fine down of both is valued for <a3_0><b6_0>use in pillows and padded garments<b6_0/><a3_0/>. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, and one of the attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The <b5_0>Chinese goose<b5_0/> is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and can be used as a guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but <a4_0><b7_0>they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids<b7_0/><a4_0/>. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers."}
