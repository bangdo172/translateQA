Other locations of religious importance in Israel are Nazareth (holy in Christianity as the site of the Annunciation of Mary), Tiberias and Safed (two of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism), the White Mosque in Ramla (holy in Islam as the shrine of the prophet Saleh), and the Church of Saint George in Lod (holy in Christianity and Islam as the tomb of Saint George or Al Khidr). A number of other religious landmarks are located in the West Bank, among them Joseph's Tomb in Nablus, the birthplace of Jesus and Rachel's Tomb in <a1_0>Bethlehem<a1_0/>, and the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron. The administrative center of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and the Shrine of the B\u00e1b are located at the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Centre in Haifa; the leader of the faith is buried in Acre. Apart from maintenance staff, there is no Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community in Israel, although it is a destination for pilgrimages. <a2_0>Bah\u00e1'\u00ed staff<a2_0/> in Israel do not teach their faith to Israelis following strict policy. A few miles south of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Centre is the Middle East centre of the reformist Ahmadiyya movement. Its mixed neighbourhood of Jews and Ahmadi Arabs is the only one of its kind in the country."}
