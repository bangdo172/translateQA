The Greek conquests largely skipped the region without any resistance or interest. Incorporated into Ptolemaic and finally Seleucid Empires, the southern Levant was heavily hellenized, building the tensions between Judeans and Greeks. The conflict erupted in <a0_0>167 BCE<a0_0/> with the Maccabean Revolt, which succeeded in establishing an independent <a1_0>Hasmonean Kingdom<a1_0/> in Judah, which later expanded over much of modern Israel, as the Seleucids gradually lost control in the region."}
