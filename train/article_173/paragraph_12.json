In 1141 Spanish-Jewish poet, <a1_0>Yehuda Halevi<a1_0/>, issued a call to the Jews to emigrate to the Land of Israel, a journey he undertook himself. In 1187 <a2_0>Sultan Saladin<a2_0/>, founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, defeated the Crusaders in the Battle of Hattin and subsequently captured Jerusalem and almost all of Palestine. In time, Saladin issued a proclamation inviting Jews to return and settle in Jerusalem, and according to Judah al-Harizi, they did: \"From the day the Arabs took Jerusalem, the Israelites inhabited it.\" Al-Harizi compared Saladin's decree allowing Jews to re-establish themselves in Jerusalem to the one issued by the Persian king Cyrus the Great over 1,600 years earlier."}
