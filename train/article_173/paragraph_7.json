From the middle of the 8th century BCE Israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding neo-Assyrian empire. Under Tiglath-Pileser III it first split Israel's territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital, <a1_0>Samaria<a1_0/> (722 BCE). An Israelite revolt (724\u2013722 BCE) was crushed after the siege and capture of Samaria by the <a2_0>Assyrian king Sargon II<a2_0/>. Sargon's son, Sennacherib, tried and failed to conquer Judah. Assyrian records say he leveled 46 walled cities and besieged Jerusalem, leaving after receiving extensive tribute."}
