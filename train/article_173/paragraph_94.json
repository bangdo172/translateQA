Since the establishment of the State in <a0_0>1948<a0_0/>, and particularly since the late 1970s, an Israeli fusion cuisine has developed. Roughly half of the Israeli-Jewish population attests to keeping kosher at home. Kosher restaurants, though rare in the 1960s, make up around <a1_0>25%<a1_0/> of the total as of 2015[update], perhaps reflecting the largely secular values of those who dine out. Hotel restaurants are much more likely to serve kosher food. The non-kosher retail market was traditionally sparse, but grew rapidly and considerably following the influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe and Russia during the 1990s. Together with non-kosher fish, rabbits and ostriches, pork\u2014often called \"<a2_0>white meat<a2_0/>\" in Israel\u2014is produced and consumed, though it is forbidden by both Judaism and Islam."}
