Israel has applied civilian law to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem and granted their inhabitants permanent residency status and the ability to apply for citizenship. The West Bank, outside of the Israeli settlements within the territory, has remained under direct military rule, and Palestinians in this area cannot become Israeli citizens. Israel withdrew its military forces and dismantled the Israeli settlements in the <a2_0>Gaza Strip<a2_0/> as part of its disengagement from Gaza though it continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters. The <a0_0>UN Security Council<a0_0/> has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be \"null and void\" and continues to view the territories as occupied. The International Court of Justice, principal judicial organ of the United Nations, asserted, in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the <a1_0>Israeli West Bank<a1_0/> barrier, that the lands captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory."}
