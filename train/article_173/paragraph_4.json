The name \"Israel\" (Standard Yisra\u02beel, Isr\u0101\u02be\u012bl; Septuagint Greek: \u1f38\u03c3\u03c1\u03b1\u03ae\u03bb Isra\u0113l; 'El(God) persists/rules' though, after Hosea 12:4 often interpreted as \"struggle with God\") in these phrases refers to the patriarch <a2_0>Jacob<a2_0/> who, according to the Hebrew Bible, was given the name after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the Lord. Jacob's twelve sons became the ancestors of the Israelites, also known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel or Children of Israel. Jacob and his sons had lived in Canaan but were forced by famine to go into Egypt for four generations, lasting 430 years, until <a1_0>Moses<a1_0/>, <a0_0>a great-great grandson of Jacob<a0_0/>, led the Israelites back into Canaan during the \"Exodus\". The earliest known archaeological artifact to mention the word \"Israel\" is the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt (dated to the late 13th century BCE)."}
