Although the Zionist movement already existed in practice, Austro-Hungarian journalist <a2_0>Theodor Herzl<a2_0/> is credited with founding political Zionism, a movement which sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel, thus offering a solution to the so-called Jewish Question of the European states, in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time.
