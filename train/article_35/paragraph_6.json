Proposals for the reunification of Germany were nothing new: earlier on 20 March <a1_0>1952<a1_0/>, talks about a <b4_0>German reunification<b4_0/>, initiated by the socalled 'Stalin Note', ended after the <b5_0>United Kingdom, France, and the United States<b5_0/> insisted that a unified Germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the European Defence Community and rearm. James Dunn (USA), who met in Paris with Eden, Adenauer and Robert Schuman (France), affirmed that \"the object should be to avoid discussion with the Russians and to press on the European Defense Community\". According to John Gaddis \"there was little inclination in Western capitals to explore this offer\" from USSR. While historian Rolf Steininger asserts that Adenauer's conviction that \u201cneutralization means sovietization\u201d was the main factor in the rejection of the soviet proposals, Adenauer also feared that unification might have resulted in the end of the CDU's dominance in the Bundestag."}
