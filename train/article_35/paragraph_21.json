Eventually, 30 of the reserved 100 documents were published; <a1_0>70<a1_0/> remained secret, and unpublished. Among the documents published is the Warsaw Treaty's nuclear war plan, <a2_0>Seven Days to the River Rhine<a2_0/> \u2013 a short, swift counter-attack capturing Austria, Denmark, Germany and Netherlands east of River Rhine, using nuclear weapons, in self-defense, after a NATO first strike. The plan originated as a <a4_0>1979<a4_0/> field training exercise war game, and metamorphosed into official <b7_0>Warsaw Treaty battle doctrine<b7_0/>, until the late 1980s \u2013 which is why the People's Republic of Poland was a nuclear weapons base, first, to 178, then, to <a3_0>250<a3_0/> tactical-range rockets. Doctrinally, as a Soviet-style (offensive) battle plan, <b8_0>Seven Days to the River Rhine<b8_0/> gave commanders few defensive-war strategies for fighting NATO in Warsaw Treaty territory.[citation needed]"}
