These states protested strongly against re-militarization of <a0_0>West Germany<a0_0/>. The Warsaw Pact was primarily put in place as a consequence of the rearming of West Germany inside NATO. <b4_0>Soviet leaders<b4_0/>, as many European countries in both western and eastern side, feared Germany being once again a military power as a direct threat and German militarism remained a fresh memory among Soviets and Eastern Europeans. As Soviet Union had already bilateral treaties with all of its eastern satellites, the Pact has been long considered 'superfluous', and because of the rushed way in which it was conceived, <b5_0>NATO<b5_0/> officials labeled it as a 'cardboard castle'. Previously, in March 1954, <a1_0>the USSR<a1_0/>, fearing the restoration of German Militarism in West Germany, requested admission to NATO."}
