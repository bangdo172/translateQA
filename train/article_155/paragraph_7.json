In <a1_0>1922<a1_0/>, this was renamed the \"<a2_0>British Empire Medal<a2_0/>\". It stopped being awarded by the United Kingdom as part of the <a3_0>1993<a3_0/> reforms to the honours system, but was again awarded beginning in 2012, starting with <a4_0>293<a4_0/> BEMs awarded for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. In addition, the BEM is awarded by the Cook Islands and by some other Commonwealth nations. In 2004, a report entitled \"A Matter of Honour: Reforming Our Honours System\" by a Commons committee recommended to phase out the Order of the British Empire, as its title was \"now considered to be unacceptable, being thought to embody values that are no longer shared by many of the country\u2019s population\"."}
