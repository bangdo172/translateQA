Shortly after being elected Governor, he was appointed <a2_0>executive editor<a2_0/> of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate <a1_0>$250,000<a1_0/> a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California. Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005. American Media Inc., which owns Muscle & Fitness and Flex, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines."}
