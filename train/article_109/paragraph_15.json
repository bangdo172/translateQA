Since identity is a virtual thing, it is impossible to <a0_0><b5_0>define it empirically<b5_0/><a0_0/>. <b6_0>Discussions of identity<b6_0/> use the term with different meanings, from fundamental and abiding sameness, to fluidity, contingency, negotiated and so on. Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a <a1_0>category of analysis<a1_0/> (Brubaker & Cooper 2000, p. 5). Indeed, many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow <a2_0>their own preconceptions of identity<a2_0/>, following more or less the frameworks listed above, rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality. In this environment, some analysts, such as Brubaker and Cooper, have suggested doing away with the concept completely (Brubaker & Cooper 2000, p. 1). Others, by contrast, have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of <a3_0>human social self-expression<a3_0/>. Hall (1992, 1996), for example, suggests treating identity as a process, <b7_0>to take into account the reality of diverse and ever-changing social experience<b7_0/>. Some scholars have introduced <a4_0>the idea of identification<a4_0/>, whereby <b8_0>identity<b8_0/> is perceived as made up of different components that are 'identified' and interpreted by individuals. The construction of an <b9_0>individual sense of self<b9_0/> is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with. Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity."}
