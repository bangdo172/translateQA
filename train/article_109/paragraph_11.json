The second, rooted in <a1_0><b4_0>social constructionist theory<b4_0/><a1_0/>, takes the view that <b5_0>identity<b5_0/> is formed by a predominantly political choice of certain characteristics. In so doing, it questions the idea that identity is a natural given, characterised by fixed, supposedly objective criteria. Both approaches need to be understood in their respective <a2_0><b6_0>political and historical contexts<b6_0/><a2_0/>, characterised by debate on issues of class, race and ethnicity.
