The concept of boundaries is useful here for demonstrating how <a4_0>identity<a4_0/> works. In the same way as <a2_0><b6_0>Barth<b6_0/><a2_0/>, in his approach to ethnicity, advocated the critical focus for investigation as being \"<b9_0>the ethnic boundary that defines the group rather than the cultural stuff that it encloses<b9_0/>\" (1969:15), social anthropologists such as Cohen and Bray have shifted the focus of <b8_0>analytical study<b8_0/> from <b7_0>identity<b7_0/> to the boundaries that are used for purposes of identification. If identity is a kind of virtual site in which the dynamic processes and markers used for identification are made apparent, boundaries provide <a3_0>the framework<a3_0/> on which this virtual site is built. They concentrated on how the idea of community belonging is differently constructed by individual members and how individuals within the group conceive ethnic boundaries."}
