Diffusion is when a person lacks both exploration in life and interest in committing even to those unchosen roles that he or she occupies. Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past, but seems willing to commit to some relevant values, goals, or roles in the future. <b7_0>Moratorium<b7_0/> is when a person displays a kind of flightiness, ready to make choices but unable to commit to them. Finally, <b8_0>achievement<b8_0/> is when a person makes identity choices and commits to them."}
