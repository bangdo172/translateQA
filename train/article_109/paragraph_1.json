How should one describe the identity of another, in ways which encompass both their <b6_0>idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications<b6_0/>, both of which can shift according to circumstance? Following on from the work of Kelly, Erikson, Tajfel and others <a2_0>Weinreich<a2_0/>'s <a1_0>Identity Structure Analysis<a1_0/> (ISA), is \"a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time \u2026 with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions\" (Weinreich and Saunderson, (eds) 2003, p1). Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms, the practical operationalisation of <b4_0><b5_0>ISA<b5_0/><b4_0/> provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual, applied across time and milieus by the \"situated self\" to appraise self and other agents and institutions (for example, resulting in the individual's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions).[citation needed]"}
