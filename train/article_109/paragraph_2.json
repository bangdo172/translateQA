Here, with respect to identity <b5_0><b6_0>diffusion<b6_0/><b5_0/> for example, <a4_0>an optimal level<a4_0/> is interpreted as the norm, as it is unrealistic to expect an individual to resolve all their conflicted identifications with others; therefore we should be alert to individuals with levels which are much higher or lower than the norm \u2013 highly diffused individuals are classified as <a1_0>diffused<a1_0/>, and those with low levels as <a2_0>foreclosed or defensive<a2_0/>. (Weinreich & Saunderson, 2003, pp 65\u201367; 105-106). Weinreich applies <a3_0>the <b7_0>identity variant<b7_0/><a3_0/> in a framework which also allows for the transition from one to another by way of biographical experiences and resolution of conflicted identifications situated in various contexts \u2013 for example, an adolescent going through family break-up may be in one state, whereas later in a stable marriage with a secure professional role may be in another. Hence, though there is continuity, there is also <b8_0>development and change<b8_0/>. (Weinreich & Saunderson, 2003, pp 22\u201323)."}
