An <a1_0>exclusive<a1_0/> boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on <b5_0>the behaviour of others<b5_0/>. An <a2_0>inclusive<a2_0/> boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to <b6_0>associate<b6_0/>. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular <a3_0><b7_0>language<b7_0/><a3_0/> merely as a neutral sign of identity. But they might also perceive it as imposing an exclusive boundary that is meant to mark them off from her. On the other hand, those who do understand the newcomer's language could take it as an inclusive boundary, through which the newcomer associates herself with them to the exclusion of the other people present. Equally, however, it is possible that people who do understand the newcomer but who also speak another language may not want to speak the newcomer's language and so see her marker as an imposition and a negative boundary. It is possible that the newcomer is either aware or unaware of this, depending on whether she herself knows other languages or is conscious of the plurilingual quality of the people there and is respectful of it or not."}
