Ryan, the Court for the first time struck down a Congressional delegation of power as violative of the doctrine of separation of powers. The aforementioned Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, another separation of powers case, was also decided during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency.

Such a plan (which was defeated in Congress) would have seriously undermined the judiciary's independence and power."}
