The Supreme Court established a precedent for judicial review in <a1_0><b3_0><b5_0>Marbury v. Madison<b5_0/><b3_0/><a1_0/>. There were protests by some at this decision, born chiefly of political expediency, but political realities in the particular case paradoxically restrained opposing views from asserting themselves.
