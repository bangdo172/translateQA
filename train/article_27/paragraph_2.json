The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of <b7_0>the two Houses of Parliament<b7_0/>, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of <b8_0>Delaware<b8_0/> was <a4_0>a member of the Court of Appeals<a4_0/>; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents. In both <b9_0>Delaware and Pennsylvania<b9_0/>, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government \"<a2_0>separate and distinct<a2_0/>.\""}
