Furthermore, it attempted to curb the power of the presidency by passing the <a1_0><b6_0>Tenure of Office Act<b6_0/><a1_0/>. The Act required Senate approval for the dismissal of senior Cabinet officials. When Johnson deliberately violated the Act, which he felt was unconstitutional (Supreme Court decisions later vindicated such a position), the House of Representatives impeached him; he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote."}
