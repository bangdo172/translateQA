That council also denounced various heresies and schisms, many of which continued to preoccupy his 45-year-long episcopate (c. 8 June 328 \u2013 2 May 373). Patriarch Athanasius spent over 17 years in <a1_0><b5_0>five<b5_0/> exiles<a1_0/> ordered by four different Roman Emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which Athanasius fled Alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life. This gave rise to the expression \"Athanasius contra mundum\" or \"Athanasius against the world\". However, during his first years as bishop, Athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of <a2_0><b6_0>Egypt and Libya<b6_0/><a2_0/>. He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including Pachomius, which proved very valuable to him over the years. Shortly thereafter, Athanasius became occupied with the theological <a3_0>disputes against <b7_0>Arians<b7_0/><a3_0/> within the Byzantine Empire that would occupy much of his life."}
