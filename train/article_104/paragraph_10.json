After his death, they believe their 21st Imam Taiyab abi al-Qasim <a1_0>went into a Dawr-e-Satr<a1_0/> (period of concealment) that continues to this day. In the absence of an imam they are led by a <a2_0>Dai-al-Mutlaq<a2_0/> (absolute missionary) who <a3_0>manages the affairs of the Imam<a3_0/>-in-Concealment until re-emergence of the Imam from concealment. Dawoodi Bohra's present 53rd Da'i al-Mutlaq is His Holiness <a4_0>Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin<a4_0/> (TUS) who succeeded his predessor the 52nd Da'i al-Mutlaq His Holiness Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin (RA). Furthermore, there has been a split in the Dawoodi Bohra sect which has led to the formation of Qutbi Bohra sect which was formed and led by Khuzaima Qutbuddin."}
