Definitions of the term vary. <a2_0><b7_0>Nikolai Trubetzkoy<b7_0/><a2_0/> in Grundz\u00fcge der Phonologie (1939) defines phonology as \"the study of sound pertaining to the system of language,\" as opposed to phonetics, which is \"the study of sound pertaining to the act of <a3_0><b8_0>speech<b8_0/><a3_0/>\" (the distinction between language and speech being basically Saussure's distinction between langue and parole). More recently, Lass (<a4_0><b9_0>1998<b9_0/><a4_0/>) writes that phonology refers broadly to the subdiscipline of linguistics concerned with the sounds of language, while in more narrow terms, \"phonology proper is concerned with the function, behavior and organization of sounds as linguistic items.\" According to Clark et al. (2007), it means the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken human language, or the field of linguistics studying this use."}
