In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The <b8_0>features<b8_0/> describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or \u2212. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the <a2_0><b6_0>emphasis on segments<b6_0/><a2_0/>. Furthermore, the generativists folded <a3_0><b7_0>morphophonology<b7_0/><a3_0/> into phonology, which both solved and created problems."}
