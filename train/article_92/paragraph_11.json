The approach was soon extended to morphology by <a2_0><b6_0>John McCarthy<b6_0/><a2_0/> and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology. The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements (e.g. features) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology', especially <a3_0><b7_0><b8_0>Mark Hale and Charles Reiss<b8_0/><b7_0/><a3_0/>."}
