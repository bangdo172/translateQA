In this view, phonology is based on <a1_0><b6_0>a set of universal phonological processes<b6_0/><a1_0/> that interact with one another; which ones are active and which are <a2_0><b7_0>suppressed<b7_0/><a2_0/> is language-specific. Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance. Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously (though the output of one process may be the input to another). The second most prominent natural phonologist is <a3_0><b8_0>Patricia Donegan<b8_0/><a3_0/> (Stampe's wife); there are many natural phonologists in Europe, and a few in the U.S., such as Geoffrey Nathan. The principles of natural phonology were extended to morphology by <a4_0><b9_0>Wolfgang U. Dressler<b9_0/><a4_0/>, who founded natural morphology."}
