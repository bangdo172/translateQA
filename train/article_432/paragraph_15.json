The current <a1_0>Basilica of the Sacred Heart<a1_0/> is located on the spot of Fr. Sorin's original church, which became too small for the growing college. It is built in <a2_0>French Revival<a2_0/> style and it is decorated by stained glass windows imported directly from France. The interior was painted by <a3_0>Luigi Gregori<a3_0/>, an Italian painter invited by Fr. Sorin to be artist in residence. The Basilica also features a bell tower with a carillon. Inside the church there are also sculptures by Ivan Mestrovic. The Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, which was built in <a4_0>1896<a4_0/>, is a replica of the original in Lourdes, France. It is very popular among students and alumni as a place of prayer and meditation, and it is considered one of the most beloved spots on campus."}
