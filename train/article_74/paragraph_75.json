Data from the Southampton Safer City Partnership shows there has been a reduction in all crimes in recent years and an increase in crime detection rates. According to government figures Southampton has a <a3_0>higher<a3_0/> crime rate than the national average. There is some controversy regarding <a4_0>comparative crime statisitics<a4_0/> due to inconsistencies between different police forces recording methodologies. For example, in Hampshire all reported incidents are recorded and all records then retained. However, in neighbouring Dorset crimes reports withdrawn or shown to be false are not recorded, reducing apparent crime figures. In the violence against the person category, the national average is 16.7 per 1000 population while Southampton is 42.4 per 1000 population. In the theft from a vehicle category, the national average is 7.6 per 1000 compared to Southampton's 28.4 per 1000. Overall, for every 1,000 people in the city, <a0_0>202<a0_0/> crimes are recorded. Hampshire Constabulary's figures for 2009/10 show <a1_0>fewer<a1_0/> incidents of recorded crime in Southampton than the previous year."}
