These charters and Royal Grants, of which there were many, also set out the governance and regulation of the town and port which remained the 'constitution' of the town until the local government organisation of the later <a2_0>Victorian period<a2_0/> which from about 1888 saw the setting up of County Councils across England and Wales and including <a3_0>Hampshire County Council<a3_0/> who now took on some of the function of Government in Southampton Town. In this regime, The Town and County of the Town of Southampton also became a county borough with shared responsibility for aspects of local government.
