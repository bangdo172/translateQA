Heavy bombing of the factory in <a3_0>September<a3_0/> 1940 destroyed it as well as homes in the vicinity, killing civilians and workers. World War II hit Southampton particularly hard because of its strategic importance as a major commercial port and industrial area. Prior to the Invasion of Europe, components for a Mulberry harbour were built here. After D-Day, Southampton docks handled military cargo to help keep the <a4_0>Allied forces<a4_0/> supplied, making it a key target of Luftwaffe bombing raids until late 1944.
