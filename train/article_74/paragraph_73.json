The building, located on <a2_0>Southern Road<a2_0/>, opened in <a3_0>2011<a3_0/> and is near to <a4_0>Southampton Central<a4_0/> railway station. Previously, the central Southampton operation was located within the west wing of the Civic Centre, however the ageing facilities and the plans of constructing a new museum in the old police station and magistrates court necessitated the move. There are additional police stations at Portswood, Banister Park, Bitterne, and Shirley as well as a British Transport Police station at Southampton Central railway station."}
