Global wind power installations increased by <a0_0><b5_0>35,800<b5_0/> MW<a0_0/> in 2010, bringing total installed capacity up to 194,400 MW, a 22.5% increase on the 158,700 MW installed at the end of 2009. The increase for 2010 represents investments totalling \u20ac47.3 billion (US$65 billion) and for the first time more than half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets of Europe and North America, mainly driven, by the continuing boom in China which accounted for nearly half of all of the installations at 16,500 MW. China now has <a1_0><b6_0>42,300 MW<b6_0/><a1_0/> of wind power installed. Wind power accounts for approximately <a2_0><b7_0>19%<b7_0/><a2_0/> of electricity generated in Denmark, <a3_0><b8_0>9%<b8_0/><a3_0/> in Spain and Portugal, and <a4_0><b9_0>6%<b9_0/><a4_0/> in Germany and the Republic of Ireland. In Australian state of South Australia wind power, championed by Premier Mike Rann (2002\u20132011), now comprises 26% of the state's electricity generation, edging out coal fired power. At the end of 2011 South Australia, with 7.2% of Australia's population, had 54%of the nation's installed wind power capacity. Wind power's share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%. These are some of the largest wind farms in the world:"}
