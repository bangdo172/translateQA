Energy sector regulators implement that policy\u2014thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid. <a1_0><b4_0><b5_0>Energy regulators<b5_0/><b4_0/><a1_0/> often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the financial feasibility of renewable energy projects. Such functions include issuing licenses, setting performance standards, monitoring the performance of regulated firms, determining the price level and structure of tariffs, establishing uniform systems of accounts, arbitrating stakeholder disputes (like interconnection cost allocations), performing management audits, developing agency human resources (expertise), reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities, and coordinating decisions with other government agencies. Thus, regulators make a wide range of decisions that affect the financial outcomes associated with RE investments. In addition, the sector regulator is in a position to give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security. The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost-containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies. <a2_0><b6_0>Since policies are not self-implementing<b6_0/><a2_0/>, energy sector regulators become a key facilitator (or blocker) of renewable energy investments."}
