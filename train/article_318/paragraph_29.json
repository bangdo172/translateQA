For example, the European Union has prescribed an indicative renewable energy target of <a1_0><b5_0>12 per cent of the total EU energy mix<b5_0/><a1_0/> and 22 per cent of electricity consumption by 2010. National targets for individual EU Member States have also been set to meet the overall target.
