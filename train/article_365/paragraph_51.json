He also made important contributions to statistical mechanics, especially his <a1_0>mathematical treatment<a1_0/> of Brownian motion, his resolution of <a2_0>the paradox of specific heats<a2_0/>, and his connection of fluctuations and dissipation. Despite his reservations about its interpretation, Einstein also made contributions to quantum mechanics and, indirectly, <a3_0>quantum field theory<a3_0/>, primarily through his theoretical studies of the photon."}
