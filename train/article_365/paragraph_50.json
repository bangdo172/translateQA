For liberal humanists such as Rousseau and Kant, the universal law of reason guided the way toward total emancipation from any kind of tyranny. These ideas were challenged, for example by the young Karl Marx, who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of human rights), asserting <a2_0>it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose<a2_0/>. For Friedrich Nietzsche, humanism was nothing more than <a3_0>a secular version of theism<a3_0/>. In his Genealogy of Morals, he argues that human rights exist <a4_0>as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong.<a4_0/> On this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny it. In the 20th century, the notion that human beings are rationally autonomous was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational desires."}
