The coat prevents <a2_0>corrosion<a2_0/> and leakage currents or shorting due to condensation. The earliest conformal coats were <a3_0>wax<a3_0/>; <b8_0>modern conformal coats<b8_0/> are usually dips of dilute solutions of silicone rubber, polyurethane, acrylic, or epoxy. Another technique for applying a conformal coating is for plastic to be sputtered onto the PCB in a vacuum chamber.
