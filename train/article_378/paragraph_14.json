For high-volume production a fixture or a rigid needle adapter is used to make contact with copper lands on the board. Building the adapter is a significant fixed cost and is only economical for <b8_0>high-volume or high-value production<b8_0/>. For small or medium volume production flying probe testers are used where test probes are moved over the board by an XY drive to make contact with the <a2_0>copper<a2_0/> lands. The <a4_0>CAM system<a4_0/> instructs the electrical tester to apply a <a3_0>voltage<a3_0/> to each contact point as required and to check that this voltage appears on the appropriate contact points and only on these."}
