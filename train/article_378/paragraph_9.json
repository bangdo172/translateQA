These <b5_0>holes<b5_0/> electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with <a1_0>three<a1_0/> layers or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear <b6_0>process<b6_0/>, or by plasma-etch. The <a2_0>de-smear<a2_0/> process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On <a3_0>high reliability<a3_0/> boards a process called <b7_0>etch-back<b7_0/> is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. The etch-back removes <a4_0><b8_0>resin<a4_0/> and the glass fibers<b8_0/> so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as <b9_0>the hole<b9_0/> is plated become integral with the deposited copper."}
