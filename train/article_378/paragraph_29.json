This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced <a2_0>crosstalk<a2_0/> (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other\u2014which almost never happens in Multiwire), though the <a3_0>cost<a3_0/> is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed."}
