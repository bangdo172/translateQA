Silver, <a1_0>zinc<a1_0/>, and aluminum are known to grow whiskers under the influence of an electric field. <b5_0>Silver<b5_0/> also grows <a2_0>conducting surface paths<a2_0/> in the presence of halide and other ions, making it a poor choice for electronics use. Tin will grow \"whiskers\" due to <a4_0>tension<a4_0/> in the plated surface. Tin-Lead or solder plating also grows whiskers, only reduced by the percentage Tin replaced. Reflow to melt solder or tin plate to relieve surface stress lowers whisker incidence.
