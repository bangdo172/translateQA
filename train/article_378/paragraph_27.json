Both <b5_0>the resin and the reinforcement<b5_0/> may absorb water; water may be also soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials aren't too susceptible, with absorption of only <a2_0>0.15%<a2_0/>. <a4_0>Teflon<a4_0/> has very low absorption of <b6_0>0.01%<b6_0/>. <b7_0>Polyimides and cyanate esters<b7_0/>, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to <b8_0>significant degradation of key parameters<b8_0/>; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about <a3_0>4<a3_0/> for common circuitboard materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating and cause <a1_0>cracking<a1_0/> and delamination, the same effect responsible for \"popcorning\" damage on wet packaging of electronic parts.
