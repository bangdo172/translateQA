A reverse mask is then applied. (Unlike a subtractive process mask, this mask exposes those parts of the substrate that will eventually become the <a0_0>traces<a0_0/>.) Additional <a1_0>copper<a1_0/> is then plated onto <b6_0>the board in the unmasked areas; copper may be plated to <a4_0>any<a4_0/> desired weight<b6_0/>. Tin-lead or other surface platings are then applied. The mask is stripped away and a brief <a2_0>etching<a2_0/> step removes the now-exposed bare original copper laminate from the board, isolating the individual traces.
