The components' leads were then passed through the holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called <a0_0>through-hole<a0_0/> construction. In <a1_0>1949<a1_0/>, <b6_0>Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko<b6_0/> of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in <a3_0>1956<a3_0/> was assigned to the <a2_0>U.S. Army<a2_0/>. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in <b7_0>a wave-soldering machine<b7_0/>. However, <b8_0>the wires and holes<b8_0/> are wasteful since <a4_0>drilling holes<a4_0/> is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off."}
