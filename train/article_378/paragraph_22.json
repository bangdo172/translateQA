The resistance, determined by <a1_0>width<a1_0/> and thickness, of the traces must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry. <b6_0>Power and ground traces<b6_0/> may need to be wider than <a2_0>signal<a2_0/> traces. In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid <a3_0>copper<a3_0/> to act as a ground plane for shielding and power return. For <a4_0>microwave circuits<a4_0/>, transmission lines can be laid out <b7_0>in the form of stripline and microstrip<b7_0/> with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent impedance. In radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the inductance and capacitance of the printed circuit board conductors become significant circuit elements, usually undesired; but they can be used as a deliberate part of the circuit design, obviating the need for additional discrete components."}
