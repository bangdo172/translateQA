The Centralab Division of <a0_0>Globe Union<a0_0/> submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a <a1_0>ceramic<a1_0/> plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded <b6_0>Mr. <a2_0>Harry W.

As well, Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, <b8_0>the <a4_0>University of Wisconsin-Madison<b8_0/><a4_0/>, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors."}
