Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities. <b8_0>Surface mounting<b8_0/> lends itself well to a high degree of <a2_0>automation<a2_0/>, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates. Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper; prices of semiconductor <a3_0>surface mount devices<a3_0/> (SMDs) are determined more by the <a4_0>chip<a4_0/> itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages. <b9_0>Some wire-ended components, such as 1N4148 small-signal switch diodes<b9_0/>, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents."}
