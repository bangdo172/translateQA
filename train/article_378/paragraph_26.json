Below Tg the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and <a3_0>glass<a3_0/>, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all volume expansion projects to <b6_0>the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes<b6_0/>. Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of <b8_0>the plating<b8_0/>, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require <a4_0>high <b7_0>Tg matrix<b7_0/><a4_0/>."}
