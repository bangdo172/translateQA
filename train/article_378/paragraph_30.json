In cordwood construction, <a1_0>axial-leaded components<a1_0/> were mounted between two parallel planes. <b6_0>The components<b6_0/> were either soldered together with jumper wire, or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads. To avoid <a2_0>shorting<a2_0/> together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that <b7_0>special <a3_0>nickel-leaded<a3_0/> components had to be used to allow the interconnecting welds to be made<b7_0/>. <a4_0>Differential thermal expansion<a4_0/> of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause physical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are <b8_0>difficult to replace<b8_0/>. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components."}
