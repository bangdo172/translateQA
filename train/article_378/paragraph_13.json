One of the most common solder resists used today is called \"LPI\" (<a2_0>liquid photoimageable solder mask<a2_0/>).  A <a3_0>photo-sensitive<a3_0/> coating is applied to the surface of <b6_0>the PWB<b6_0/>, then exposed to light through the solder mask image film, and finally developed where the unexposed areas are washed away. Dry film solder mask is similar to <b7_0>the dry film used to image the PWB for plating or etching<b7_0/>. After being laminated to the PWB surface it is imaged and develop as LPI. Once common but no longer commonly used <b8_0>because of its low accuracy and resolution<b8_0/> is to <a4_0>screen print epoxy ink<a4_0/>. <b9_0>Solder resist<b9_0/> also provides protection from the environment."}
