Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were laid out on the mylar and then <a1_0><b6_0>traces<a1_0/> were routed to connect the pads<b6_0/>. Rub-on dry transfers of <a3_0>common component footprints<a3_0/> increased efficiency. <b7_0>Traces<b7_0/> were made with <a2_0>self-adhesive tape<a2_0/>. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in <b8_0>layout<b8_0/>. To fabricate the board, <b9_0>the finished photomask<b9_0/> was photolithographically reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank <a4_0>copper<a4_0/>-clad boards."}
