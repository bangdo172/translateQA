Treatments, such as <a1_0><b6_0>benzimidazolethiol<b6_0/><a1_0/>, prevent surface oxidation of bare copper. The places to which components will be mounted are typically plated, because untreated bare copper <a0_0>oxidizes<a0_0/> quickly, and therefore is not readily solderable. Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with <b7_0>solder<b7_0/> by <a2_0>hot air solder levelling<a2_0/> (HASL). The HASL finish prevents oxidation from <b8_0>the underlying copper<b8_0/>, thereby guaranteeing a <a3_0>solderable surface<a3_0/>. This solder was a <a4_0>tin-lead<a4_0/> alloy, however <b9_0>new solder compounds<b9_0/> are now used to achieve compliance with the RoHS directive in the EU and US, which restricts the use of lead. One of these lead-free compounds is SN100CL, made up of 99.3% tin, 0.7% copper, 0.05% nickel, and a nominal of 60ppm germanium."}
