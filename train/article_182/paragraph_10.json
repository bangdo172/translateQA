Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, anthropologists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, have conducted a <a1_0><b6_0>genetic<b6_0/><a1_0/> analysis of human body lice that suggests clothing originated quite recently, around 170,000 years ago. <b9_0>Body lice<b9_0/> is an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to <a2_0><b7_0>survive<b7_0/><a2_0/>.

However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago (Reed et al. 2004. PLoS Biology 2(11): e340).
