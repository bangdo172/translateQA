Matar\u00e9 had previous experience in developing crystal rectifiers from <b5_0>silicon and germanium<b5_0/> in the German radar effort <b6_0>during World War II<b6_0/>. Using this knowledge, he began researching the phenomenon of \"interference\" in 1947. By June <b7_0>1948<b7_0/>, witnessing currents flowing through point-contacts, Matar\u00e9 produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by Welker, similar to what Bardeen and Brattain had accomplished earlier in December 1947.
