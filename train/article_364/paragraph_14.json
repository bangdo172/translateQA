The IGFET is more commonly known as <a2_0>a metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor FET (MOSFET)<a2_0/>, reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (<b6_0>the gate<b6_0/>), oxide (the insulation), and <b5_0>semiconductor<b5_0/>. Unlike IGFETs, <a3_0>the JFET gate forms a p\u2013n diode with the channel<a3_0/> which lies between the source and drain. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube triode which, similarly, forms a diode between its grid and cathode. Also, <b8_0>both devices<b8_0/> operate in the <a4_0>depletion mode<a4_0/>, they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage."}
