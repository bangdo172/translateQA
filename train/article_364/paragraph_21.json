It is for this reason that GaAs is used in <a2_0><b8_0>high-frequency applications<b8_0/><a2_0/>. A relatively recent FET development, the <a3_0>high-electron-mobility transistor<a3_0/> (HEMT), has a heterostructure (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in <a4_0>satellite receivers<a4_0/> working at frequencies around 12 GHz. HEMTs based on gallium nitride and <b7_0>aluminium gallium nitride<b7_0/> (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications."}
