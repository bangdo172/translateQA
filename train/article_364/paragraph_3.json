Solid State Physics Group leader <a2_0><b6_0>William Shockley<b6_0/><a2_0/> saw the potential in this, and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors. The term transistor was coined by <a3_0>John R. Pierce<a3_0/> as <a4_0>a contraction of the term transresistance<a4_0/>. According to Lillian Hoddeson and Vicki Daitch, authors of a biography of John Bardeen, Shockley had proposed that Bell Labs' first patent for a transistor should be based on the field-effect and that he be named as the inventor. Having unearthed Lilienfeld\u2019s patents that went into obscurity years earlier, lawyers at Bell Labs advised against Shockley's proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a \"grid\" was not new. Instead, what Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley invented in <b5_0>1947<b5_0/> was the first point-contact transistor. In acknowledgement of this accomplishment, Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect.\""}
