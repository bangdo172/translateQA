This construction produces two p\u2013n junctions: a base\u2013emitter junction and a base\u2013collector junction, separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region (two junction diodes <b8_0>wired together<b8_0/> without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor)."}
