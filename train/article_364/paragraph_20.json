The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to <b5_0><b7_0><b8_0>semiconductor<b7_0/> diodes<b8_0/><b5_0/>). The <a2_0>lower<a2_0/> the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that <a3_0>less power is required to \"drive\" the transistor<a3_0/>. The junction forward voltage for a given current <a4_0>decreases<a4_0/> with increase in temperature. For a typical <b6_0>silicon<b6_0/> junction the change is \u22122.1 mV/\u00b0C. In some circuits special compensating elements (sensistors) must be used to compensate for such changes."}
