This property is called <a0_0>gain<a0_0/>. It can produce a stronger output signal, a voltage or current, which is proportional to a <b7_0>weaker<b7_0/> input signal; that is, <a1_0>it can act as an amplifier<a1_0/>. Alternatively, the transistor can be used to <a2_0>turn current on or off in a circuit<a2_0/> as an electrically controlled switch, where <b4_0>the amount of current<b4_0/> is determined by <a3_0>other circuit elements<a3_0/>."}
