The triode, however, was a fragile device that <b8_0>consumed a lot of power<b8_0/>. <a2_0>Physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld<a2_0/> filed a patent for a field-effect transistor (FET) in <a3_0><b9_0>Canada<b9_0/><a3_0/> in <a4_0>1925<a4_0/>, which was intended to be a solid-state replacement for the triode. Lilienfeld also filed identical patents in <b5_0>the United States<b5_0/> in 1926 and 1928. However, <b7_0>Lilienfeld did not publish any research articles about his devices<b7_0/> nor did his patents cite any specific examples of a working prototype. Because the production of high-quality semiconductor materials was still <b6_0>decades<b6_0/> away, Lilienfeld's solid-state amplifier ideas would not have found practical use in the 1920s and 1930s, even if such a device had been built. In 1934, German inventor Oskar Heil patented a similar device."}
