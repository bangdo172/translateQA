They are useful in amplifiers because the currents at the emitter and collector are <b5_0>controllable by a relatively small base current<b5_0/>. In an n\u2013p\u2013n transistor operating in the active region, <b7_0>the emitter\u2013base junction<b7_0/> is forward biased (electrons and holes recombine at the junction), and electrons are injected into the base region. Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and move away from the junction) base\u2013collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled. Collector current is approximately <a3_0>\u03b2 (common-emitter current gain) times the base current<a3_0/>. It is typically <a4_0><b8_0>greater than 100<b8_0/><a4_0/> for <b6_0>small-signal transistors<b6_0/> but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications."}
