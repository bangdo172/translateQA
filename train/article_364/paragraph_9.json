The transistor provides <a1_0>current gain<a1_0/>, allowing <b5_0>a relatively large current<b5_0/> in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal. <b7_0>The ratio of these currents<b7_0/> varies depending on <a2_0><b4_0>the type of transistor<b4_0/><a2_0/>, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the <a3_0>collector current<a3_0/>.
