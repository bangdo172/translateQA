For enhancement mode, the channel is off <a1_0>at zero bias<a1_0/>, and a gate potential can \"enhance\" the conduction. For the depletion mode, the channel is on <a2_0>at zero bias<a2_0/>, and a <b6_0>gate potential<b6_0/> (of the opposite polarity) can \"deplete\" the channel, reducing conduction. For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a <b7_0>higher current<b7_0/> for <a3_0>n-channel devices<a3_0/> and a lower current for <a4_0>p-channel devices<a4_0/>. Nearly all JFETs are <b8_0>depletion-mode<b8_0/> because the diode junctions would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement-mode devices; most IGFETs are enhancement-mode types."}
