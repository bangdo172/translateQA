Early forms of the Church Educational System Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy and early school President Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the \"<a0_0><b5_0>Domestic Organization<b5_0/><a0_0/>\", which was a group of teachers who would <b6_0>visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption<b6_0/>. <b7_0>The Honor Code<b7_0/> itself was not created until <a1_0>about 1940<a1_0/>, and was used mainly for <a2_0>cases of cheating and academic dishonesty<a2_0/>. President Wilkinson expanded the <b8_0>Honor Code<b8_0/> in <a3_0>1957<a3_0/> to include other school standards. This led to what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process, and must be adhered by <a4_0>all students, faculty, and staff<a4_0/>. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In certain cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure. Both LDS and non-LDS students are required to meet annually with a Church leader to receive an ecclesiastical endorsement for both acceptance and continuance. Various LGBT advocacy groups have protested the honor code and criticized it as being anti-gay, and The Princeton Review ranked BYU as <b9_0>the 3rd most LGBT-unfriendly school in the United States."}
