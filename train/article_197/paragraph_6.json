Harris<b10_0/><a6_0/><a1_0/> was appointed the university's president in 1921. He was the first BYU president to have a <a0_0><a5_0>doctoral<a5_0/> degree<a0_0/>. Harris made several important changes to the school, reorganizing it into a true university, whereas before, its organization had remnants of the Academy days. At the beginning of his tenure, the school was not officially recognized as a university by any accreditation organization. By the end of his term, the school was accredited under all major accrediting organizations at the time. He was eventually replaced by <b11_0>Howard S. McDonald<b11_0/>, who received his doctorate from the University of California. When he first received the position, <a7_0>the Second World War had just ended<a7_0/>, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown <a4_0>nearly five times<a4_0/> to an enrollment of 5,440 students. The university did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of <a2_0>an Air Force Base<a2_0/> in Ogden, Utah and rebuilt it to house some of the students. The next president, <a3_0><b12_0>Ernest L. Wilkinson<b12_0/><a3_0/>, also oversaw a period of intense growth, as the school adopted an accelerated building program. Wilkinson was responsible for the building of over eighty structures on the campus, many of which still stand. During his tenure, the student body increased <a8_0>six times<a8_0/>, making BYU the largest private school at the time. The quality of the students also increased, leading to higher educational standards at the school. Finally, <b13_0>Wilkinson<b13_0/> reorganized the LDS Church units on campus, with ten stakes and <a9_0>over 100<a9_0/> wards being added during his administration."}
