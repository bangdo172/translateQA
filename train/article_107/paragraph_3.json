The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the <a5_0>erosion of the <a1_0><b11_0>Rocky Mountains<b11_0/><a5_0/><a1_0/>. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into <a2_0><a8_0><b12_0>oil and natural gas<b12_0/><a8_0/><a2_0/>. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, <a3_0>a <b13_0>rock salt<b13_0/><a3_0/>. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands.
