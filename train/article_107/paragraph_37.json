There have been no significant historically recorded earthquakes in Houston, but researchers do not discount the possibility of such quakes having occurred in the deeper past, nor occurring in the future. Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because <a3_0><b8_0>water<b8_0/><a3_0/> has been pumped out of the ground for many years. It may be associated with slip along the faults; however, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves. These faults also tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed \"<a4_0><b9_0>fault creep<b9_0/><a4_0/>\", which further reduces the risk of an earthquake."}
