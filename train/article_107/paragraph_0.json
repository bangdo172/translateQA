The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older <b13_0>slave states<b13_0/>. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs. In 1860 <a8_0>forty-nine percent<a8_0/> of the city's population was enslaved. A few slaves, perhaps as many as <b14_0>2,000<b14_0/> between 1835 and 1865, came through the illegal African trade. Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state. They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers nearly <a9_0>tripled<a9_0/> in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566."}
