You have become Europe's indispensable nation.\" According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. \"This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position at the center of the Continent.\" <b7_0>Heilbrunn<b7_0/> believes that the adage, \"what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union\" has been supplanted by a new mentality\u2014what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its <a1_0>Nazi past<a1_0/> and more on its <a2_0>Prussian history<a2_0/>, which many Germans believe was betrayed\u2014and not represented\u2014by <b5_0>Nazism<b5_0/>. The evolution is further precipitated by <a3_0>Germany<a3_0/>'s conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski's effusive praise for his country's western neighbor. This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see <b6_0>World War II<b6_0/> as a distant memory."}
