There were several reasons behind this war. As German nationalism grew strongly inside the German Confederation and neither could decide on how Germany was going to be unified into a nation-state. The Austrians favoured the Greater Germany unification but were not willing to give up any of the <a3_0><b10_0>non-German-speaking<b10_0/> land inside of the Austrian Empire<a3_0/> and take second place to Prussia. The Prussians however wanted to unify <b11_0>Germany<b11_0/> as <a2_0><a6_0>Little Germany<a6_0/><a2_0/> primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia, whilst excluding Austria. In the final battle of the German war <a1_0>(Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz<a1_0/>) the <a5_0><b9_0>Prussia<a5_0/>ns<b9_0/> successfully defeated the Austrians and succeeded in creating the <a7_0>North German Confederation<a7_0/>."}
