(Since the late 19th century, musical setting of prose and free verse has also been practiced in some art music, though popular music tends to remain conservative in its retention of <a2_0><b7_0>stanzaic<b7_0/><a2_0/> forms with or without refrains.) A rudimentary example of translating <b5_0>poetry<b5_0/> for singing is <a3_0><b8_0>church hymns<b8_0/><a3_0/>, such as the German chorales translated into English by <a4_0><b9_0>Catherine Winkworth<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
