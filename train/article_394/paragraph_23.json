Cohen<b6_0/><a1_0/>, the policy became \"the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text\", except for any <a2_0><b7_0>bawdy<a2_0/> passages<b7_0/> and the addition of copious explanatory footnotes. In regard to style, the Victorians' aim, achieved through far-reaching metaphrase (literality) or pseudo-metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers <a3_0><b8_0>that they were reading a foreign classic<b8_0/><a3_0/>. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, Edward FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely <a4_0><b9_0>by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes<b9_0/><a4_0/> and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original."}
