During the <a2_0><b7_0>Middle Ages<b7_0/><a2_0/>, translations of some of these Arabic versions were made into Latin, chiefly at C\u00f3rdoba in Spain. King Alfonso X el Sabio (Alphonse the Wise) of Castille in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a Schola Traductorum (<a3_0><b8_0>School of Translation<b8_0/><a3_0/>) in Toledo. There Arabic texts, Hebrew texts, and Latin texts were translated into the other tongues by Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars, who also argued the merits of their respective religions.
