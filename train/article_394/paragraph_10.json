In his seminal lecture \"On the Different Methods of Translation\" (<a2_0><b7_0>1813<b7_0/><a2_0/>) he distinguished between translation methods that move \"the writer toward [the reader]\", i.e., <a3_0><b8_0>transparency<b8_0/><a3_0/>, and those that move the \"reader toward [the author]\", i.e., an <a4_0><b9_0>extreme fidelity to the foreignness of the source text<b9_0/><a4_0/>. Schleiermacher favored the latter approach; he was motivated, however, not so much by a desire to embrace the foreign, as by a nationalist desire to oppose France's cultural domination and to promote German literature."}
