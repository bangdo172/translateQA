One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the <a2_0><b6_0>assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical<b6_0/><a2_0/> setting places great challenges on the translator. There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there <a3_0><b7_0>by subdividing or combining notes<b7_0/><a3_0/>, respectively, but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line."}
