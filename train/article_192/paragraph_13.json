Four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect: <a2_0>lighting, film speed, f-number (aperture size), and shutter speed (exposure time)<a2_0/>. The equation may be expressed as ratios, or, by taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides, by addition, using the <b7_0>APEX<b7_0/> system, in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure; this increment is commonly known as a <a4_0>\"<b6_0>stop<b6_0/>\"<a4_0/>. The <b8_0>effective f-number<b8_0/> is proportional to <a0_0>the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter<a0_0/>, the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area. Thus, a lens set to f/1.4 allows <a3_0><b9_0>twice as much<b9_0/><a3_0/> light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f/2. Therefore, each f-number factor of the square root of two (approximately 1.4) is also a stop, so lenses are typically marked in that progression: f/1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32, etc."}
