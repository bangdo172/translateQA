The rationale is that <a3_0>exposure according to the lower saturation-based speed would not result in a visibly better <b5_0>image<b5_0/><a3_0/>. In addition, an exposure latitude can be specified, ranging <a1_0>from the saturation-based speed to the <b6_0>10:1<b6_0/> noise-based speed<a1_0/>. If the noise-based speed (40:1) is lower than the saturation-based speed, or undefined because of high noise, the saturation-based speed is specified, rounded <b7_0>upwards<b7_0/> to a standard value, because <b8_0><b9_0>using the noise-based speed<b8_0/> would lead to overexposed images<b9_0/>. The camera may also report the <a2_0>SOS-based speed<a2_0/> (explicitly as being an SOS speed), rounded to the nearest standard speed rating."}
