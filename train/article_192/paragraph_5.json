Originally the sensitivity was written <a1_0>as a fraction with 'tenths' (for example \"18/10\u00b0 DIN\")<a1_0/>, where the resultant value 1.8 represented the relative base 10 logarithm of the speed. 'Tenths' were later abandoned with <b7_0>DIN 4512:1957-11<b7_0/>, and the example above would be written as \"18\u00b0 DIN\". The degree symbol was finally dropped <a2_0>with <b5_0>DIN 4512:1961-10<b5_0/><a2_0/>. This revision also saw significant changes in the definition of film speeds in order <a3_0>to accommodate then-recent changes in the American <b6_0>ASA PH2.5-1960<b6_0/> standard<a3_0/>, so that film speeds of black-and-white negative film effectively <a4_0><b9_0>would become doubled<b9_0/><a4_0/>, that is, a film previously marked as \"18\u00b0 DIN\" would now be labeled as \"<b8_0>21 DIN<b8_0/>\" without emulsion changes."}
