The company continued to publish Weston film ratings after 1955, but while their recommended values often differed slightly from the ASA film speeds found on film boxes, these newer Weston values were based on <a1_0>the ASA system<a1_0/> and had to be converted for use with older Weston meters <a2_0>by subtracting <b7_0>1/3 exposure stop<b7_0/><a2_0/> as per Weston's recommendation. Vice versa, \"old\" Weston film speed ratings could be converted into \"new\" Westons and the ASA scale by adding the same amount, that is, a film rating of 100 Weston (up to 1955) corresponded with 125 ASA (as per ASA PH2.5-1954 and before). This <b8_0>conversion<b8_0/> was not necessary on Weston meters manufactured and Weston film ratings published since <a3_0>1956<a3_0/> due to their inherent use of the ASA system; however the changes of the ASA PH2.5-1960 revision may be taken into account when comparing with newer ASA or ISO values."}
