The usual design is that the camera's parameters for interpreting the sensor data values into sRGB values are fixed, and a number of different EI choices are accommodated by varying <b6_0>the sensor's signal gain<b6_0/> in the analog realm, prior to conversion to digital. Some camera designs provide at least some EI choices <a1_0>by adjusting the sensor's signal gain in the digital realm<a1_0/>. A few camera designs also provide <b7_0>EI adjustment<b7_0/> through a choice of lightness parameters for the interpretation of sensor data values into sRGB; this variation allows different <b8_0>tradeoffs between the range of highlights that can be captured and the amount of noise introduced<b8_0/> into the shadow areas of the photo."}
