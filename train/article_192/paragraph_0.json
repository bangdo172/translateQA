In both digital and film photography, the <a2_0><b7_0>reduction of exposure<a2_0/> corresponding to use of higher sensitivities generally leads to <a4_0>reduced <b8_0>image quality<b8_0/><b7_0/><a4_0/> (via coarser film grain or higher image noise of other types). In short, the higher the sensitivity, the grainier the image will be. Ultimately <a0_0>sensitivity<a0_0/> is limited by <b9_0>the quantum efficiency<b9_0/> of the film or sensor."}
