An aspect ratio of 16:9 was duly agreed upon at the first meeting of <a1_0>the <b6_0>IWP11/6 working party<b6_0/><a1_0/> at the BBC's Research and Development establishment in Kingswood Warren. The resulting ITU-R Recommendation ITU-R BT.709-2 (\"Rec. 709\") includes the 16:9 aspect ratio, a specified colorimetry, and the scan modes 1080i (1,080 actively interlaced lines of resolution) and 1080p (1,080 progressively scanned lines). The British Freeview HD trials used <a3_0><b8_0>MBAFF<b8_0/><a3_0/>, which contains both progressive and interlaced content in the same encoding."}
