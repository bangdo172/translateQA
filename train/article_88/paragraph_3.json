NHK set out to create an HDTV system that ended up scoring much higher in subjective tests than NTSC's previously dubbed \"HDTV\". This new system, NHK Color, created in <a2_0><b7_0>1972<b7_0/><a2_0/>, included 1125 lines, a <a3_0><b8_0>5:3<b8_0/><a3_0/> aspect ratio and 60 Hz refresh rate. <a4_0>The <b9_0>Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers<b9_0/> (SMPTE)<a4_0/>, headed by Charles Ginsburg, became the testing and study authority for HDTV technology in the international theater. SMPTE would test HDTV systems from different companies from every conceivable perspective, but the problem of combining the different formats plagued the technology for many years."}
