To be shown on standard television, in PAL-system countries, cinema film is scanned at the TV rate of <a1_0><b6_0>25 frame/s<a1_0/>,<b6_0/> causing a speedup of 4.1 percent, which is generally considered acceptable. In NTSC-system countries, the TV scan rate of 30 frame/s would cause a perceptible speedup if the same were attempted, and the necessary correction is performed by a technique called <a2_0><b7_0>3:2 Pulldown<a2_0/>:<b7_0/> Over each successive pair of film frames, one is held for three video fields (1/20 of a second) and the next is held for two video fields (1/30 of a second), giving a total time for the two frames of <a3_0><b8_0>1/12 of a second<b8_0/><a3_0/> and thus achieving <a4_0>the <b9_0>correct average film frame rate<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
