These broadcasting systems can be used for both SDTV and HDTV. In the US <a3_0>the Grand Alliance<a3_0/> proposed <a0_0>ATSC<a0_0/> as the new standard for SDTV and HDTV. Both ATSC and DVB were based on the <a1_0>MPEG-2<a1_0/> standard, although DVB systems may also be used to transmit video using the newer and more efficient H.264/MPEG-4 AVC compression standards. Common for all DVB standards is the use of highly efficient modulation techniques for further reducing bandwidth, and foremost for reducing receiver-hardware and antenna requirements."}
