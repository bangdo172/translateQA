These recommendations, however, did not fit in the broadcasting bands which could reach home users. The standardization of MPEG-1 in 1993 also led to the acceptance of recommendations ITU-R BT.709. In anticipation of these standards the <a1_0>Digital Video Broadcasting<a1_0/> (DVB) organisation was formed, <a2_0><b6_0>an alliance of broadcasters, consumer electronics manufacturers and regulatory bodies<b6_0/><a2_0/>.
