However the Prussians resisted strongly, and the French suffered <a3_0>86 casualties<a3_0/> to the Prussian <a4_0>83 casualties<a4_0/>. Saarbr\u00fccken also proved to be a major obstacle in terms of logistics. Only one railway there led to the German hinterland but could be easily defended by a single force, and the only river systems in the region ran along the border instead of inland. While the French hailed the invasion as the first step towards the Rhineland and later Berlin, General Le B\u0153uf and Napoleon III were receiving alarming reports from foreign news sources of Prussian and Bavarian armies massing to the southeast in addition to the forces to the north and northeast."}
