The Crown Prince of Prussia's 3rd army had, on the quick reaction of his Chief of Staff General von Blumenthal, drawn reinforcements which brought its strength up to <a2_0>140,000 troops<a2_0/>. The French had been slowly reinforced and their force numbered only <a3_0>35,000<a3_0/>. Although badly outnumbered, the French defended their position just outside Fr\u00f6schwiller. By afternoon, the Germans had suffered c.\u200910,500 killed or wounded and the French had lost a similar number of casualties and another c.\u20099,200 men taken prisoner, a loss of about 50%. The Germans captured Fr\u00f6schwiller which sat on a hilltop in the centre of the French line. Having lost any hope for victory and facing a massacre, the French army disengaged and retreated in a westerly direction towards Bitche and Saverne, hoping to join French forces on the other side of the Vosges mountains. The German 3rd army did not pursue the French but remained in <a4_0>Alsace<a4_0/> and moved slowly south, attacking and destroying the French garrisons in the vicinity."}
