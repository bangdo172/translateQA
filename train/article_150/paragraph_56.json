Lessons drawn from the war included the need for a <a1_0>general staff system<a1_0/>, the scale and duration of future wars and the tactical use of artillery and cavalry. The bold use of artillery by the Prussians, to silence French guns at long range and then to directly support infantry attacks at close range, proved to be superior to the defensive doctrine employed by French gunners. The Prussian tactics were adopted by <a2_0>European armies<a2_0/> by 1914, exemplified in the French 75, an artillery piece optimised to provide direct fire support to <a3_0>advancing infantry<a3_0/>. Most European armies ignored the evidence of the <a4_0>Russo-Japanese War<a4_0/> of 1904\u201305 which suggested that infantry armed with new smokeless-powder rifles could engage gun crews effectively. This forced gunners to fire at longer range using indirect fire, usually from a position of cover."}
