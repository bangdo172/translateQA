It was developed in such secrecy, that little training with the weapon had occurred, leaving French gunners with no experience; the gun was treated like <a4_0>artillery<a4_0/> and in this role it was ineffective. Worse still, once the small number of soldiers who had been trained how to use the new weapon became casualties, there were no replacements who knew how to operate the mitrailleuse."}
