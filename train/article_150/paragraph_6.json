Napoleon III personally led the army with Marshal MacMahon in attendance. The Army of Ch\u00e2lons marched northeast towards the Belgian border to avoid the Prussians before striking south to link up with Bazaine. The Prussians, under the command of Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, took advantage of this maneuver to catch the French in a pincer grip. He left the Prussian First and Second Armies besieging Metz, except three corps detached to form the Army of the Meuse under the Crown Prince of Saxony. With this army and <a3_0>the Prussian Third Army<a3_0/>, Moltke marched northward and caught up with the French at Beaumont on 30 August. After a sharp fight in which they lost <a4_0>5,000 men<a4_0/> and 40 cannons, the French withdrew toward Sedan. Having reformed in the town, the Army of Ch\u00e2lons was immediately isolated by the converging Prussian armies. Napoleon III ordered the army to break out of the encirclement immediately. With MacMahon wounded on the previous day, General Auguste Ducrot took command of the French troops in the field."}
