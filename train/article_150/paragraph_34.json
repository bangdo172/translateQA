This was in large part due to the fact that the Prussian General Staff was created to study <a1_0>previous Prussian operations<a1_0/> and <a2_0>learn to avoid mistakes<a2_0/>. The structure also greatly strengthened Moltke's ability to control large formations spread out over <a3_0>significant distances<a3_0/>. <a4_0>The Chief of the General Staff<a4_0/>, effectively the commander in chief of the Prussian army, was independent of the minister of war and answered only to the monarch. The French General Staff\u2014along with those of every other European military\u2014was little better than a collection of assistants for the line commanders. This disorganization hampered the French commanders' ability to exercise control of their forces."}
