This organization of forces was due to a lack of supplies, forcing each division to seek out basic provisions along with the representatives of the army supply arm that was supposed to aid them. What made a bad situation much worse was the conduct of <a3_0>General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot<a3_0/>, commander of <a4_0>the 1st Division<a4_0/>. He told General Abel Douay, commander of the 2nd Division, on 1 August that \"The information I have received makes me suppose that the enemy has no considerable forces very near his advance posts, and has no desire to take the offensive\". Two days later, he told MacMahon that he had not found \"a single enemy post ... it looks to me as if the menace of the Bavarians is simply bluff\". Even though Ducrot shrugged off the possibility of an attack by the Germans, MacMahon tried to warn the other divisions of his army, without success."}
