It was discovered that Prussia had recently built <a3_0>defences<a3_0/> around the big North German ports, including coastal artillery batteries with Krupp heavy artillery, which with a range of 4,000 yards (3,700 m), had double the range of French naval guns. The French Navy lacked the <a4_0>heavy guns<a4_0/> to engage the coastal defences and the topography of the Prussian coast made a seaborne invasion of northern Germany impossible."}
