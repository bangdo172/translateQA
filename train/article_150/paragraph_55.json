This was partly due to the peacetime organisations of the armies. Each Prussian Corps was based within a Kreis (<a2_0>literally \"circle\"<a2_0/>) around the chief city in an area. Reservists rarely lived more than a day's travel from their regiment's depot. By contrast, French regiments generally served far from their depots, which in turn were not in the areas of France from which their soldiers were drawn. Reservists often faced several days' journey to report to their depots, and then another long journey to join their regiments. Large numbers of reservists choked railway stations, vainly seeking rations and orders."}
