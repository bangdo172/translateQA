Some of them were veterans of previous French campaigns in the Crimean War, Algeria, <a1_0>the Franco-Austrian War<a1_0/> in Italy, and in the Franco-Mexican War. However, following the \"Seven Weeks War\" between <a2_0>Prussia and Austria<a2_0/> four years earlier, it had been calculated that the French Army could field only 288,000 men to face the Prussian Army when perhaps 1,000,000 would be required. Under <a3_0>Marshal Adolphe Niel<a3_0/>, urgent reforms were made. Universal conscription (rather than by ballot, as previously) and a shorter period of service gave increased numbers of reservists, who would swell the army to a planned strength of 800,000 on mobilisation. Those who for any reason were not conscripted were to be enrolled in <a4_0>the Garde Mobile<a4_0/>, a militia with a nominal strength of 400,000. However, the Franco-Prussian War broke out before these reforms could be completely implemented. The mobilisation of reservists was chaotic and resulted in large numbers of stragglers, while the Garde Mobile were generally untrained and often mutinous."}
