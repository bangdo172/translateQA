The leader of the monarchists in Parliament, <a2_0>Adolphe Thiers<a2_0/>, spoke for moderation, arguing that France had won the diplomatic battle and there was no reason for war, but he was drowned out by cries that he was a traitor and a Prussian. Napoleon's new prime minister, <a3_0>Emile Ollivier<a3_0/>, declared that France had done all that it could humanly and honorably do to prevent the war, and that he accepted the responsibility \"with a light heart.\" A crowd of 15\u201320,000 people, carrying flags and patriotic banners, marched through the streets of Paris, demanding war. On <a4_0>19 July 1870<a4_0/> a declaration of war was sent to the Prussian government. The southern German states immediately sided with Prussia."}
