Napoleon III, then the emperor of France, demanded compensations in Belgium and on the left bank of the Rhine to secure France's strategic position, which the Prussian chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, flatly refused. Prussia then turned its attention towards the south of Germany, where it sought to incorporate the southern German kingdoms, Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt, into a unified Prussia-dominated Germany. France was <a4_0>strongly opposed to any further alliance of German states<a4_0/>, which would have significantly strengthened the Prussian military."}
