During the day, elements of a <a1_0>Bavarian and two Prussian corps<a1_0/> became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery, which blasted holes in the defenses of the town. Douay held a very strong position initially, thanks to the accurate <a3_0>long-range fire of the Chassepots<a3_0/> but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it.
