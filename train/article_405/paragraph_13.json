Baron argues several reasons why this is the case, citing the unprecedented rise of the <a1_0>United States<a1_0/> and its predominant position as the key reason. Baron highlights that since World War Two no other great power has been able to achieve parity or near parity with <b7_0>the United States<b7_0/>, with the exception of <b6_0>the Soviet Union<b6_0/> for a brief time. This position is unique among the great powers <b4_0>since the start of the <a2_0>modern era (the 16th century)<b4_0/><a2_0/>, where there has traditionally always been \"tremendous parity among the great powers\".
