It was first coined in 1944 by <a1_0><b5_0>William T.R. Fox<b5_0/><a1_0/> and according to him, there were <b8_0>three<b8_0/> superpowers: <b6_0>the <a2_0>British Empire, the United States, and the Soviet Union<b6_0/><a2_0/>. But by <b7_0>the mid-1950s<b7_0/> the <a3_0>British Empire<a3_0/> lost its superpower status, leaving the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's superpowers.[nb 2] The term <b9_0>middle power<b9_0/> has emerged for <a4_0>those nations which exercise a degree of global influence, but are insufficient to be decisive on international affairs<a4_0/>. Regional powers are those whose influence is generally confined to their region of the world."}
