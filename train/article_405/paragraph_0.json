The \"Great Powers\" constituted the \"Concert of <a1_0>Europe<a1_0/>\" and claimed the right to joint enforcement of the postwar treaties. The formalization of the division between small powers and great powers came about with the signing of the <a0_0><b5_0>Treaty of Chaumont<b5_0/><a0_0/> in <b6_0>1814<b6_0/>. Since then, the international balance of power has shifted numerous times, most dramatically during <a2_0><b7_0>World War I and World War II<b7_0/><a2_0/>. While some nations are widely considered to be great powers, there is no definitive list of them.
