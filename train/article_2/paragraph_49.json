Laird writes that \"after the Mongol troops left Tibet, no Ming troops replaced them.\" Wang and Nyima state that, despite the fact that the Ming refrained from sending troops to subdue Tibet and refrained from garrisoning Ming troops there, these measures were unnecessary so long as the Ming court upheld close ties with Tibetan vassals and their forces. However, there were instances in <a0_0>the 14th century<a0_0/> when the Hongwu Emperor did use military force to quell unrest in Tibet. John D. Langlois writes that there was unrest in Tibet and western Sichuan, which the Marquis Mu Ying (\u6c90\u82f1) was commissioned to quell in <a1_0>November 1378<a1_0/> after he established a Taozhou garrison in Gansu. Langlois notes that by October 1379, Mu Ying had allegedly captured <a2_0>30,000<a2_0/> Tibetan prisoners and <a3_0>200,000<a3_0/> domesticated animals. Yet invasion went both ways; the <a4_0>Ming general Qu Neng<a4_0/>, under the command of Lan Yu, was ordered to repel a Tibetan assault into Sichuan in 1390."}
