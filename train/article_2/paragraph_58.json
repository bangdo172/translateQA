Even the History of Ming states that <a2_0>the Tibetan lamas<a2_0/> discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary <a3_0><a4_0>Yang Tinghe<a4_0/><a3_0/> under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people."}
