In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, G\u00fcshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to <a3_0>the regent Sonam Ch\u00f6pel<a3_0/>. Although G\u00fcshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \"supreme authority\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon G\u00fcshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point G\u00fcshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and G\u00fcshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokite\u015bvara through the performance of rituals,\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies. Goldstein states that the government of G\u00fcshi Khan and the Dalai Lama persecuted the Karma Kagyu sect, confiscated their wealth and property, and even converted their monasteries into Gelug monasteries. Rawski writes that this Mongol patronage allowed the Gelugpas to dominate the rival religious sects in Tibet."}
