Tom Grunfeld says that Tsongkhapa claimed ill health in his refusal to appear at the Ming court, while Rossabi adds that Tsongkhapa cited the \"length and arduousness of the journey\" to China as another reason not to make an appearance. This first request by the Ming was made in <a0_0>1407<a0_0/>, but the Ming court sent another embassy in <a1_0>1413<a1_0/>, this one led by the eunuch Hou Xian (\u5019\u986f; fl. 1403\u20131427), which was again refused by Tsongkhapa. Rossabi writes that Tsongkhapa did not want to entirely alienate the Ming court, so he sent <a2_0>his disciple Chosrje Sh\u0101kya Yeshes<a2_0/> to Nanjing in <a3_0>1414<a3_0/> on his behalf, and upon his arrival in 1415 the Yongle Emperor bestowed upon him the title of \"State Teacher\"\u2014the same title earlier awarded the Phagmodrupa ruler of Tibet. The Xuande Emperor (r. 1425\u20131435) even granted this disciple Chosrje Sh\u0101kya Yeshes the title of a \"King\" (\u738b). This title does not appear to have held any practical meaning, or to have given its holder any power, at Tsongkhapa's Ganden Monastery. Wylie notes that this\u2014like the Karma Kargyu\u2014cannot be seen as a reappointment of Mongol Yuan offices, since the Gelug school was created after the fall of the Yuan dynasty."}
