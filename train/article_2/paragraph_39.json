Norbu writes that <a4_0>the Yongle Emperor<a4_0/>, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet <a2_0>the Karmapa<a2_0/> and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by <a3_0>Kublai<a3_0/> Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him."}
