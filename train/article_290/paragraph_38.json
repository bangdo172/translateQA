Von Neumann's method used a <a1_0>pivoting algorithm between simplices<a1_0/>, with the pivoting decision determined by a nonnegative least squares subproblem with a convexity constraint (projecting the zero-vector onto the convex hull of the active simplex). Von Neumann's <a2_0>algorithm was the first interior point method of linear programming."}
