In <a0_0>1941<a0_0/>, he derived the exact distribution of the ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the <a1_0>Durbin\u2013Watson statistic<a1_0/> for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the <a2_0>alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression<a2_0/>."}
