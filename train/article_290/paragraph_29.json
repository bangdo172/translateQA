He concluded that the entire <a0_0>physical universe could be made subject to the universal wave function<a0_0/>. Since something \"outside the calculation\" was needed to collapse the wave function, von Neumann concluded that the collapse was caused by the <a1_0>consciousness of the experimenter<a1_0/> (although this view was accepted by Eugene Wigner, the <a2_0>Von Neumann\u2013Wigner interpretation never gained acceptance amongst the majority of physicists<a2_0/>)."}
