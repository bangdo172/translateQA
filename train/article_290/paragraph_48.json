Its purpose was to <a0_0>decide on the feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon<a0_0/>. Von Neumann had long argued that <a1_0>while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time<a1_0/>. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in <a2_0>1959<a2_0/>, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable."}
