For example, with Robert D. Richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves. A problem was that when computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, <a2_0>they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves)<a2_0/>. The mathematics of artificial viscosity <a1_0>smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics<a1_0/>. Other well known contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution to blast waves, and the co-discovery of the ZND detonation model of explosives."}
