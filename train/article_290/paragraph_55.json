However, the theory could not be implemented until <a1_0>advances in computing of the 1960s.<a1_0/> He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in <a2_0>1949<a2_0/>, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first <a3_0>computer virus<a3_0/>, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology."}
