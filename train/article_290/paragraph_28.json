In 1966, John S. Bell published a paper arguing that the <a1_0>proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid<a1_0/>. However, in 2010, Jeffrey Bub argued that <a2_0>Bell had misconstrued von Neumann's proof<a2_0/>, and pointed out that the proof, though not valid for all hidden variable theories, does rule out a well-defined and important subset. Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation, and that <a3_0>von Neumann did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories<a3_0/>."}
