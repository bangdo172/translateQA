In mathematics, continuous geometry is an analogue of complex projective geometry, where <a1_0>instead of the dimension of a subspace being in a discrete set 0, 1, ..., n, it can be an element of the unit interval<a1_0/> [0,1]. Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of von Neumann algebras with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions, and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the <a2_0>projections of the hyperfinite type II factor<a2_0/>."}
