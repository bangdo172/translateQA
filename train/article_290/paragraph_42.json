Implosion was the only method that could be used with the plutonium-239 that was available from the Hanford Site. He established the design of the explosive lenses required, but there remained concerns about \"edge effects\" and imperfections in the explosives. His calculations showed that implosion would work if it did <a1_0>not depart by more than 5% from spherical symmetry<a1_0/>. After a series of failed attempts with models, this was achieved by <a2_0>George Kistiakowsky<a2_0/>, and the construction of the Trinity bomb was completed in July <a3_0>1945<a3_0/>."}
