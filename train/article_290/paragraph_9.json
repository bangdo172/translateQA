So it was decided that the best career path was to become a <a0_0>chemical engineer<a0_0/>. This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the <a1_0>University of Berlin<a1_0/>, after which he sat the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich, which he passed in September 1923. At the same time, von Neumann also entered <a2_0>P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter University in Budapest<a2_0/>, as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he chose to produce an <a3_0>axiomatization of Cantor's set theory<a3_0/>. He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating from ETH Zurich in 1926. He then went to the University of G\u00f6ttingen on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study mathematics under David Hilbert."}
