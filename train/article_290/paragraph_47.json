He accepted this position and used it to further the production of compact hydrogen bombs suitable for <a1_0>Intercontinental ballistic missile delivery<a1_0/>. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of tritium and lithium 6 needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the intermediate range missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible, and that the <a2_0>relative inaccuracy of the missile<a2_0/> wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, which turned out to be the case. Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, he testified on the latter's behalf at the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing, at which he asserted that <a3_0>Oppenheimer<a3_0/> was loyal, and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead."}
