However, G\u00f6del had already discovered this consequence, now known as his <a2_0>second incompleteness theorem<a2_0/> and sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems. Von Neumann acknowledged G\u00f6del's priority in his next letter. He never thought much of \"the American system of claiming personal priority for everything.\""}
