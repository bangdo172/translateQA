He enjoyed Yiddish and \"off-color\" humor (especially <a0_0>limericks<a0_0/>). He was a non-smoker. At Princeton he received complaints for <a1_0>regularly playing extremely loud German march music<a1_0/> on his gramophone, which distracted those in neighbouring offices, including <a2_0>Albert Einstein,<a2_0/> from their work. Von Neumann did some of his best work blazingly fast in noisy, chaotic environments, and once admonished his wife for preparing a quiet study for him to work in. He never used it, preferring the couple's living room with its television playing loudly."}
