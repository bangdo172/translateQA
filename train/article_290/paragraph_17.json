Under the <a1_0>Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel<a1_0/> approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the <a2_0>class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set."}
