Eugene Wigner wrote that, seeing von Neumann's mind at work, \"one had the impression of a perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch.\" <a1_0>Paul Halmos states that \"von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring.\"<a1_0/> Israel Halperin said: \"Keeping up with him was ... impossible. The feeling was you were on a tricycle chasing a racing car.\" Edward Teller wrote that von Neumann effortlessly outdid anybody he ever met, and said \"I never could keep up with him\". Teller also said \"von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us. Most people avoid thinking if they can, some of us are addicted to thinking, but von <a2_0>Neumann actually enjoyed thinking, maybe even to the exclusion of everything else.<a2_0/>\""}
