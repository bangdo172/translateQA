At the age of <a0_0>15<a0_0/>, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst <a1_0>G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151<a1_0/>. On their first meeting, Szeg\u0151 was so astounded with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears. Some of von Neumann's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szeg\u0151, sketched out on his father's stationery, are still on display at the von Neumann archive in Budapest. By the age of 19, von Neumann had published <a2_0>two major mathematical papers<a2_0/>, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded <a3_0>Georg Cantor<a3_0/>'s definition. At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, von Neumann sat for and won the <a4_0>E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Prize, a national prize for mathematics<a4_0/>."}
