A strongly negative answer arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical <a2_0>Congress of K\u00f6nigsberg<a2_0/>, in which <a0_0>Kurt G\u00f6del<a0_0/> announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that <a1_0>they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language<a1_0/>. This result was sufficiently innovative as to confound the majority of mathematicians of the time."}
