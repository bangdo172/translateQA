At the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to <a0_0>Russell's paradox<a0_0/> (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by <a1_0>Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel<a1_0/>. Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics. But they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets\u2014<a2_0>the axiom of foundation and the notion of class."}
