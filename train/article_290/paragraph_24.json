Von Neumann provided an abstract exploration of dimension in completed complemented modular topological lattices: \"Dimension is determined, up to a positive linear transformation, by the following two properties. It is <a1_0>conserved by perspective mappings (\"perspectivities\") and ordered by inclusion<a1_0/>. The deepest part of the proof concerns the equivalence of perspectivity with \"projectivity by decomposition\"\u2014of which a corollary is the transitivity of perspectivity.\" <a2_0>Garrett Birkhoff<a2_0/> writes: \"John von Neumann's brilliant mind blazed over lattice theory like a meteor\"."}
