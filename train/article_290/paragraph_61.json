In this period von Neumann returned to the Roman Catholic faith that had also been significant to his mother after the family's conversion in 1929\u20131930. John had earlier said to his mother, \"There is probably a God. Many things are easier to explain if there is than if there isn't.\" Von Neumann held on to his exemplary knowledge of Latin and quoted to a deathbed visitor the declamation \"Judex ergo cum sedebit,\" and ends \"Quid sum miser tunc dicturus? Quem patronum rogaturus, Cum vix iustus sit securus?\" (When the judge His seat hath taken ... What shall wretched I then plead? Who for me shall intercede when the righteous scarce is freed?)"}
