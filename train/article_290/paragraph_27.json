For example, the uncertainty principle, according to which the <a1_0>determination of the position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa<a1_0/>, is translated into the non-commutativity of the two corresponding operators. This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the <a2_0>formulations of both Heisenberg and Schr\u00f6dinger<a2_0/>. When Heisenberg was informed von Neumann had clarified the difference between an unbounded operator that was a Self-adjoint operator and one that was merely symmetric, Heisenberg replied \"Eh? What is the difference?\""}
