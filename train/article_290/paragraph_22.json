In anticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of operators, von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite decomposition, and reformulated the problem of measure in terms of functions. In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory, he used the Haar theorem in the solution of <a2_0>Hilbert's fifth problem in the case of compact groups<a2_0/>. In 1938, he was awarded the <a1_0>B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize<a1_0/> for his work in analysis."}
