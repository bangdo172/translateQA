This theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far), there exists <a2_0>a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses<a2_0/>, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider <a3_0>all the possible responses of his adversary.<a3_0/> The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss."}
