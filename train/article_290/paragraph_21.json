The work of Banach had implied that the problem of measure has a positive solution if n = 1 or n = 2 and a negative solution in all other cases. Von Neumann's work argued that the \"problem is essentially group-theoretic in character, and that, in particular, for the solvability of the problem of measure the ordinary <a1_0>algebraic concept of solvability of a group is relevant<a1_0/>. Thus, according to von Neumann, it is the <a2_0>change of group that makes a difference, not the change of space<a2_0/>.\""}
