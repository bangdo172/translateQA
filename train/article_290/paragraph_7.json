This was one of the best schools in Budapest, part of a brilliant education system designed for the elite. Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one <a1_0>gymnasium<a1_0/>. Despite being run by the Lutheran Church, the majority of its pupils were Jewish. The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, that included Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n (b. 1881), George de Hevesy (b. 1885), Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd (b. 1898), Eugene Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908), and Paul Erd\u0151s (b. 1913). Collectively, they were sometimes known as <a2_0>Martians<a2_0/>. Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School. When asked why the Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses, Wigner, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in <a3_0>1963<a3_0/>, replied that von Neumann was the only genius."}
