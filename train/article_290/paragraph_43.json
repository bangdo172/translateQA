Von Neumann <a1_0>oversaw computations<a1_0/> related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital <a2_0>Kyoto<a2_0/>, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by <a3_0>Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson."}
