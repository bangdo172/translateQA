The study of von Neumann's model of an expanding economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics. This paper has been called the greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of <a2_0>fixed-point theorems, linear inequalities, complementary slackness, and saddlepoint duality<a2_0/>. In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was <a1_0>unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself."}
