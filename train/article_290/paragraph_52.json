During this time he contributed to the development of the Monte Carlo method, which <a1_0>allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using random numbers<a1_0/>. His algorithm for simulating a fair coin with a biased coin is used in the \"software whitening\" stage of some hardware random number generators. Because using lists of \"truly\" random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making <a2_0>pseudorandom numbers<a2_0/>, using the middle-square method. Though this method has been criticized as crude, von Neumann was aware of this: he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal, and also noted that when it went awry it did so obviously, unlike methods which could be subtly incorrect. \"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.\""}
