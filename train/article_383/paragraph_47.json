Notable efforts are improvements to San Diego freeways, expansion of San Diego Airport, and doubling the capacity of the cruise ship terminal of the port. Freeway projects included expansion of Interstates 5 and 805 around \"<a0_0><b5_0>The Merge<b5_0/><a0_0/>,\" a rush-hour spot where the two freeways meet. Also, an expansion of Interstate 15 through the North County is underway with the addition of <a3_0>high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) \"managed lanes\"<a3_0/>. There is a tollway (<a1_0><b6_0>The South Bay Expressway<b6_0/><a1_0/>) connecting SR 54 and Otay Mesa, near the Mexican border. According to a 2007 assessment, <a4_0><b8_0><b9_0>37 percent<b9_0/><b8_0/><a4_0/> of streets in San Diego were in acceptable driving condition. The proposed budget fell $84.6 million short of bringing the city's streets to an acceptable level. Port expansions included a second cruise terminal on Broadway Pier which opened in 2010. Airport projects include expansion of <a2_0><b7_0>Terminal 2<b7_0/><a2_0/>, currently under construction and slated for completion in summer 2013."}
