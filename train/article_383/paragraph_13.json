Traditionally, San Diegans have built their homes and businesses on the mesas, while leaving the urban canyons relatively wild. Thus, the canyons give parts of the city a segmented feel, creating gaps between otherwise proximate neighborhoods and contributing to a low-density, car-centered environment. <b8_0>The <a3_0>San Diego River<b8_0/><a3_0/> runs through the middle of San Diego from <a0_0><b5_0>east to west<b5_0/><a0_0/>, creating a river valley which serves to divide the city into northern and southern segments. The river used to flow into <a4_0><b9_0>San Diego Bay<b9_0/><a4_0/> and its fresh water was the focus of the earliest Spanish explorers.[citation needed] Several <a1_0><b6_0>reservoirs<b6_0/><a1_0/> and Mission Trails Regional Park also lie between and separate developed areas of the city."}
