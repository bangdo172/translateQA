Significant <a3_0><b8_0>U.S. Navy<b8_0/><a3_0/> presence began in 1901 with the establishment of the Navy Coaling Station in Point Loma, and expanded greatly during the 1920s.

The city was also an early center for aviation: as early as World War I, San Diego was proclaiming itself \"The Air Capital of the West\". The city was home to important airplane developers and manufacturers like Ryan Airlines (later Ryan Aeronautical), founded in 1925, and <a4_0><b9_0>Consolidated Aircraft<b9_0/><a4_0/> (later Convair), founded in 1923.
