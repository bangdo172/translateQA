In 1850, <a1_0><b6_0>William Heath Davis<b6_0/><a1_0/> promoted a new development by the Bay shore called \"New San Diego\", several miles south of the original settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted only a few houses, a pier and an Army depot. In the late 1860s, <a2_0><b7_0>Alonzo Horton<b7_0/><a2_0/> promoted a move to the bayside area, which he called \"<a4_0><b9_0>New Town<b9_0/><a4_0/>\" and which became Downtown San Diego. Horton promoted the area heavily, and people and businesses began to relocate to New Town because of its location on San Diego Bay convenient to shipping. New Town soon eclipsed the original settlement, known to this day as Old Town, and became the economic and governmental heart of the city. Still, San Diego remained a relative backwater town until <a3_0><b8_0>the arrival of a railroad connection<b8_0/><a3_0/> in 1878."}
