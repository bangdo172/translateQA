Burke's religious thought was grounded in the belief that <a1_0>religion<a1_0/> is the foundation of <b5_0>civil society<b5_0/>. He sharply criticised deism and atheism, and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress. Born in Ireland to a <a2_0>Catholic<a2_0/> <b6_0>mother<b6_0/> and a <a3_0>Protestant<a3_0/> <b7_0>father<b7_0/>, Burke vigorously defended the <a0_0>Anglican<a0_0/> Church, but also demonstrated sensitivity to <b9_0>Catholic<b9_0/> concerns. He linked the conservation of a state (established) religion with the preservation of citizens' constitutional liberties and highlighted <b8_0>Christianity<b8_0/>'s benefit not only to the believer's soul, but also to <a4_0>political arrangements<a4_0/>."}
