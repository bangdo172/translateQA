Burke defended this prejudice on the grounds that it is \"the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages\" and superior to individual reason, which is small in comparison. \"Prejudice\", Burke claimed, \"is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit\". Burke criticised <b5_0>social contract theory<b5_0/> by claiming that society is indeed, a contract, but \"a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, <b6_0>those who are dead, and those who are to be born<b6_0/>\"."}
