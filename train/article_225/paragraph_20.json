Burke's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources. His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism. <a1_0>Philip Francis<a1_0/> wrote to Burke saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was \"<b4_0>pure foppery<b4_0/>\". <a2_0><b7_0>Edward Gibbon<b7_0/><a2_0/>, however, reacted differently: \"I adore his chivalry\". Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the Duchesse de Biron, that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage, <a3_0><b6_0>she burst into tears<b6_0/><a3_0/> and took considerable time to finish reading it. Price had rejoiced that the French king had been \"led in triumph\" during the October Days, but to <b8_0>Burke<b8_0/> this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror\u2014that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette\u2014was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman."}
