In a letter of 9 August 1789, Burke wrote: \"England gazing with astonishment at a French struggle for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner\". The events of <b5_0>5\u20136 October 1789<b5_0/>, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel <a0_0>King Louis XVI<a0_0/> to return to Paris, turned Burke against it. In a letter to his son, <a1_0>Richard Burke<a1_0/>, dated <b6_0>10 October<b6_0/> he said: \"This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France\u2014where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it\u2014where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable\". On 4 November <a2_0><b7_0>Charles-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Depont<b7_0/><a2_0/> wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution. Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken \"as no more than the expression of doubt\" but he added: \"You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom\". In the same month he described France as \"a country undone\". Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on <a3_0><b8_0>9 February 1790<b8_0/><a3_0/>, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox:"}
