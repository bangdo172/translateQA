He opposed democracy for <a1_0><b6_0>three<b6_0/><a1_0/> basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, <b7_0>common people<b7_0/> had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by <a2_0>demagogues<a2_0/>; he feared that the <a3_0><b9_0>authoritarian<a3_0/> impulses<b9_0/> that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over unpopular minorities, who needed the protection of <a4_0><b8_0>the upper classes<b8_0/><a4_0/>."}
