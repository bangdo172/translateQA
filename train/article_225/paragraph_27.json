Burke wrote of its reception: \"Not one word from one of our party. They are secretly <a3_0>galled<a3_0/>. They agree with me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox. ... They leave me to myself; they see that I can do myself justice\". <a4_0><b9_0>Charles Burney<b9_0/><a4_0/> viewed it as \"a most admirable book\u2014the best & most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen\" but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly."}
