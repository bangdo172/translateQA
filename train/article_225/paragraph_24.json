In debate in Parliament on Britain's relations with <a0_0>Russia<a0_0/>, Fox praised the principles of the revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was \"overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House\". When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as <a1_0>hereditary<a1_0/> power. On <b4_0>6 May 1791<b4_0/>, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, <b8_0>Burke<b8_0/> used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new <a2_0>French<a2_0/> Constitution and \"the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man\". Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions. Burke was interrupted, and <b5_0>Fox<b5_0/> intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech. A vote of censure was moved against Burke, however, for noticing the affairs of France, which was moved by Lord Sheffield and seconded by Fox. Pitt made a speech praising Burke, and Fox made a speech\u2014<b6_0>both rebuking and complimenting<b6_0/> Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke's own speeches of <a3_0><b7_0>fourteen and fifteen years<a3_0/> before<b7_0/>."}
