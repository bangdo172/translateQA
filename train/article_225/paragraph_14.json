His interaction with the British dominion of India began well before Hastings' impeachment trial. For <a2_0>two decades<a2_0/> prior to the impeachment, Parliament had dealt with the Indian issue. This trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation. In <b8_0>1781<b8_0/> Burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the East India Company when he was appointed Chairman of <a3_0>the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs<a3_0/>\u2014from that point until the end of the trial; India was Burke's primary concern. This committee was charged \"to investigate alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali, and other Indian difficulties\". While Burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters, a second 'secret' committee was formed to assess the same issues. Both committee reports were written by Burke. Among other purposes, the reports conveyed to the Indian princes that Britain would not wage war on them, along with demanding that the <b9_0>HEIC<b9_0/> recall Hastings. This was Burke's first call for substantive change regarding imperial practices. When addressing the whole House of Commons regarding the committee report, Burke described the Indian issue as one that \"began 'in commerce' but 'ended in <a4_0>empire<a4_0/>.'\""}
