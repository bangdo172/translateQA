This Burke did in <a1_0><b7_0>April 1791<b7_0/><a1_0/> when he published <b6_0>A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly<b6_0/>. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher <a2_0>Jean-Jacques Rousseau<a2_0/>, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \"a <b8_0>considerable insight<b8_0/> into human nature\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in <a3_0>1766\u20137<a3_0/> Burke was a friend of <a4_0>David Hume<a4_0/>, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding\u2014but vanity\"\u2014which he \"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\". He also cited Rousseau's <b9_0>Confessions<b9_0/> as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \"obscure and vulgar vices\" that was not \"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\"."}
