His most important publication in this regard was his <a3_0><b5_0>Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents<b5_0/> of <b6_0>23 April 1770<b6_0/><a3_0/>. Burke identified the \"discontents\" as stemming from the \"secret influence\" of <b7_0>a <a2_0>neo-Tory<a2_0/> group<b7_0/> he labelled as, the \"<b8_0>king's friends<b8_0/>\", whose system \"comprehending the exterior and interior administrations, is commonly called, in the technical language of the Court, Double Cabinet\". Britain needed a party with \"an unshaken adherence to principle, and attachment to connexion, against every allurement of interest\". Party divisions \"whether operating for good or evil, are things inseparable from free government\"."}
