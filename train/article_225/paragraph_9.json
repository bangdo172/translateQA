He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one before moving to the next. His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary, and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in America would not be. Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in <a0_0><b4_0>America<b4_0/><a0_0/>. \"An <b5_0>armament<b5_0/>\", Burke said, \"is not a victory\". Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment; it would do the British Government no good to engage in a <b7_0>scorched earth war<b7_0/> and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless. The American colonists could always retreat into <a3_0>the <b8_0>mountains<b8_0/><a3_0/>, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design. The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience; the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force, and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished <a2_0>thousands of miles<a2_0/> away from home. Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic \u2013 the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak, and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil."}
