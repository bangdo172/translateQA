According to Sahlins, ethnographic data indicated that hunter-gatherers worked far fewer hours and enjoyed more leisure than <b5_0>typical members of industrial society<b5_0/>, and they still ate well. Their \"affluence\" came from the idea that they were satisfied with very little in the material sense. Later, in <a1_0><b7_0>1996<b7_0/><a1_0/>, Ross Sackett performed two distinct meta-analyses to empirically test Sahlin's view. The first of these studies looked at 102 time-allocation studies, and the second one analyzed 207 energy-expenditure studies. Sackett found that adults in foraging and horticultural societies work, on average, about 6.5 hours a day, where as people in agricultural and industrial societies work on average <a2_0>8.8 hours a day<a2_0/>."}
