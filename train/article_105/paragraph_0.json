Pitch is closely related to <a1_0>frequency<a1_0/>, but the two are not equivalent. Frequency is an objective, scientific attribute that can be measured. <a2_0>Pitch<a2_0/> is each person's subjective perception of a sound, which cannot be directly measured. However, this does not necessarily mean that most people won't agree on which notes are higher and lower."}
