A listener hears <a1_0>numerous<a1_0/> frequencies at once. The vibration with the lowest frequency is called the fundamental frequency; the other frequencies are overtones. Harmonics are an important class of <a2_0>overtones<a2_0/> with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental. Whether or not the higher frequencies are integer multiples, they are collectively called <a3_0>the partials<a3_0/>, referring to the different parts that make up the total spectrum."}
