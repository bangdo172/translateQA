Below 500 Hz, the jnd is about 3 Hz for sine waves, and 1 Hz for complex tones; above 1000 Hz, the jnd for sine waves is about 0.6% (about 10 cents). The jnd is typically tested by <a1_0>playing two tones in quick succession<a1_0/> with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches. The jnd becomes smaller if the two tones are played simultaneously as the listener is then able to discern beat frequencies. The total number of perceptible pitch steps in the range of human hearing is about <a2_0>1,400<a2_0/>; the total number of notes in the equal-tempered scale, from 16 to 16,000 Hz, is 120."}
