For instance, a <a0_0>snare drum<a0_0/> sounds higher pitched than a bass drum though both have indefinite pitch, because its sound contains higher frequencies. In other words, it is possible and often easy to roughly discern the relative pitches of two sounds of <a2_0>indefinite pitch<a2_0/>, but sounds of indefinite pitch do not neatly correspond to any specific pitch. A special type of pitch often occurs in free nature when sound reaches the ear of an observer directly from the source, and also after reflecting off a sound-reflecting surface. This phenomenon is called repetition pitch, because <a1_0>the addition of a true repetition of the original sound<a1_0/> to itself is the basic prerequisite."}
