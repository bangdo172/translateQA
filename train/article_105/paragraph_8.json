In standard Western equal temperament, the notion of pitch is insensitive to \"<a0_0>spelling<a0_0/>\": the description \"G4 double sharp\" refers to the same pitch as <a1_0>A4<a1_0/>; in other temperaments, these may be distinct pitches. Human perception of musical intervals is approximately <a2_0>logarithmic<a2_0/> with respect to fundamental frequency: the perceived interval between the pitches \"A220\" and \"A440\" is the same as the perceived interval between the pitches A440 and A880. Motivated by this logarithmic perception, music theorists sometimes represent pitches using a <a3_0>numerical<a3_0/> scale based on the logarithm of fundamental frequency. For example, one can adopt the widely used MIDI standard to map fundamental frequency, f, to a real number, p, as follows"}
