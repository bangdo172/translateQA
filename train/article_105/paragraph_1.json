(See Frequencies of notes.) Distance in this space corresponds to musical intervals as understood by musicians. An equal-tempered semitone is subdivided into <a3_0>100<a3_0/> cents. The system is flexible enough to include \"microtones\" not found on standard piano keyboards. For example, the pitch halfway between C (60) and C\u266f (61) can be labeled <a4_0>60.5<a4_0/>."}
