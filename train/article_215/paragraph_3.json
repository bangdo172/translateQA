Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds. They operate by disrupting the <a0_0>sodium/potassium<a0_0/> balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, but they have been phased out <a1_0>because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate<a1_0/>.:239\u2013240 Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced <b5_0>organochlorines<b5_0/>. <b6_0>Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely<b6_0/> and causing a variety of symptoms such as <a4_0><b7_0>weakness or paralysis<b7_0/><a4_0/>. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates, and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates.:136\u2013137 Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., atrazine), ureas (e.g., diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., alachlor). <a2_0>Phenoxy compounds<a2_0/> tend to selectively kill <b8_0>broad-leaf weeds<b8_0/> rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, <b9_0>crushing the plant's nutrient transport system<b9_0/>.:300 Triazines interfere with <a3_0>photosynthesis<a3_0/>.:335 Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate."}
