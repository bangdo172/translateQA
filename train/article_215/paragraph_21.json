Reducing the use of pesticides and <a1_0>choosing less toxic pesticides<a1_0/> may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use. Integrated pest management, the use of multiple approaches to control pests, is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as <b6_0>Indonesia, <b5_0>China<b5_0/>, Bangladesh, the U.S., <a2_0>Australia<a2_0/>, and <b9_0>Mexico<b9_0/><b6_0/>. IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an ecosystem, so that natural balances are not upset. New pesticides are being developed, including <b8_0>biological and botanical<b8_0/> derivatives and alternatives that are thought to <a3_0>reduce <b7_0>health and environmental risks<b7_0/><a3_0/>. In addition, <a4_0>applicators<a4_0/> are being encouraged to consider alternative controls and adopt methods that reduce the use of chemical pesticides."}
