The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago <b5_0>in ancient Mesopotamia<b5_0/>. The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control. By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as <b6_0>arsenic, mercury, and lead<b6_0/> were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, <a1_0><b7_0>nicotine sulfate<b7_0/><a1_0/> was extracted from <a4_0>tobacco leaves<a4_0/> for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, <b8_0>pyrethrum<b8_0/>, which is derived from <b9_0>chrysanthemums<b9_0/>, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables. Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant. <a3_0>Paul M\u00fcller<a3_0/> discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide. Herbicides became common in the <a2_0>1960s<a2_0/>, led by \"triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate\"."}
