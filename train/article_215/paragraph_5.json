For example, they are used to kill mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like <a0_0><b6_0>West Nile virus, yellow fever, and malaria<b6_0/><a0_0/>. They can also kill bees, wasps or <b8_0>ants<b8_0/> that can cause allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas. Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by moldy food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside <b7_0>weeds, trees and brush<b7_0/>. They can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage. <a1_0>Herbicides<a1_0/> are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like <b4_0>swimming and fishing<b4_0/> and <b5_0>cause the water to look or smell unpleasant<b5_0/>. Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses. Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk. Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the United States <a2_0>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)<a2_0/> and the <a3_0>Pest Management Regulatory Agency<a3_0/> (PMRA) of Canada."}
