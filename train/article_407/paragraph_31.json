A team made up entirely of Manchus drew up the Treaty of Kyakhta (<a0_0>1727<a0_0/>) to solidify the diplomatic understanding with <a1_0>Russia<a1_0/>. In exchange for <a2_0>territory and trading rights<a2_0/>, the Qing would have a free hand dealing with the situation in <a3_0>Mongolia<a3_0/>. Yongzheng then turned to that situation, where the Zunghars threatened to re-emerge, and to the southwest, where local Miao chieftains resisted Qing expansion. These campaigns drained the treasury but established the emperor's control of the military and military finance."}
