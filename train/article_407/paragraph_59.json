It was not until 1861 \u2014 a year after losing the <a2_0>Second Opium War<a2_0/> to the Anglo-French coalition \u2014 that the Qing government bowed to foreign pressure and created a proper foreign affairs office known as the <a0_0>Zongli Yamen<a0_0/>. The office was originally intended to be temporary and was staffed by officials seconded from the Grand Council. However, as dealings with foreigners became increasingly complicated and frequent, the office grew in size and importance, aided by revenue from customs duties which came under its direct jurisdiction."}
