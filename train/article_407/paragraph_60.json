It was established before the fall of the Ming, but it became mature only after 1661, following the death of the Shunzhi Emperor and the accession of his son, the <a0_0>Kangxi<a0_0/> Emperor. The department's original purpose was to manage the internal affairs of the imperial family and the activities of the inner palace (in which tasks it largely replaced eunuchs), but it also played an important role in Qing relations with Tibet and Mongolia, engaged in trading activities (<a2_0>jade, ginseng, salt, furs<a2_0/>, etc.), managed textile factories in the <a1_0>Jiangnan region<a1_0/>, and even published books. Relations with the Salt Superintendents and salt merchants, such as those at Yangzhou, were particularly lucrative, especially since they were direct, and did not go through absorptive layers of bureaucracy. The department was manned by booi,[o] or \"bondservants,\" from the Upper Three Banners. By the 19th century, it managed the activities of at least 56 subagencies."}
