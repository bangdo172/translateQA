Apart from the estates of the officials, the comparatively minuscule aristocracy, and the degree-holding literati, there also existed a major division among ordinary Chinese between commoners and people with inferior status. They were divided into two categories: one of them, <a1_0>the good \"commoner\" people, the other \"mean\" people<a1_0/>. The majority of the population belonged to the first category and were described as <a2_0>liangmin<a2_0/>, a legal term meaning good people, as opposed to jianmin meaning the mean (or ignoble) people. Qing law explicitly stated that the traditional four occupational groups of scholars, farmers, artisans and merchants were \"good\", or having a status of commoners. On the other hand, slaves or bondservants, entertainers (including prostitutes and actors), and those low-level employees of government officials were the \"mean people\". Mean people were considered legally inferior to commoners and suffered unequal treatments, forbidden to take the imperial examination."}
