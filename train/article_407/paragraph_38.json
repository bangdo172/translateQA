The Qing navy, composed entirely of wooden sailing junks, was severely outclassed by the modern tactics and firepower of the <a0_0>British<a0_0/> Royal Navy. British soldiers, using advanced muskets and artillery, easily outmaneuvered and outgunned Qing forces in ground battles. The Qing surrender in <a1_0>1842<a1_0/> marked a decisive, humiliating blow to China. The <a2_0>Treaty of Nanjing,<a2_0/> the first of the unequal treaties, demanded war reparations, forced China to open up the five ports of <a3_0>Canton, Amoy, Fuchow, Ningpo and Shanghai<a3_0/> to western trade and missionaries, and to cede <a4_0>Hong Kong Island<a4_0/> to Britain. It revealed many inadequacies in the Qing government and provoked widespread rebellions against the already hugely unpopular regime."}
