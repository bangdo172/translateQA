So much so that upon his death he was extraordinarily bestowed the posthumous title of <a1_0>Emperor Yi<a1_0/> (Chinese: \u7fa9\u7687\u5e1d), the only instance in Qing history in which a Manchu \"prince of the blood\" (Chinese: \u89aa\u738b) was so honored. Two months into Shunzhi's personal rule, Dorgon was not only stripped of his titles, but his corpse was disinterred and mutilated.[b] to atone for multiple \"crimes\", one of which was persecuting to death Shunzhi\u2019s agnate eldest brother, <a2_0>Hooge<a2_0/>. More importantly, Dorgon's symbolic fall from grace also signaled a political purge of his family and associates at court, thus reverting power back to the person of the emperor. After a promising start, Shunzhi's reign was cut short by his early death in <a3_0>1661<a3_0/> at the age of <a4_0>twenty-four<a4_0/> from smallpox. He was succeeded by his third son Xuanye, who reigned as the Kangxi Emperor."}
