His son <a1_0>Hong Taiji<a1_0/> renamed the dynasty Great Qing in 1636. There are competing explanations on the meaning of Q\u012bng (lit. \"clear\" or \"pure\"). The name may have been selected in reaction to the name of the Ming dynasty (\u660e), which consists of the Chinese characters for \"sun\" (\u65e5) and \"moon\" (\u6708), both associated with the fire element of the Chinese zodiacal system. The character Q\u012bng (\u6e05) is composed of \"water\" (\u6c35) and \"azure\" (\u9752), both associated with the water element. This association would justify the Qing conquest as defeat of fire by water. The <a2_0>water imagery<a2_0/> of the new name may also have had Buddhist overtones of perspicacity and enlightenment and connections with the Bodhisattva Manjusri. The Manchu name daicing, which sounds like a phonetic rendering of D\u00e0 Q\u012bng or Dai Ching, may in fact have been derived from a <a3_0><a4_0>Mongolian<a3_0/> word that means \"warrior\"<a4_0/>. Daicing gurun may therefore have meant \"warrior state\", a pun that was only intelligible to Manchu and Mongol people. In the later part of the dynasty, however, even the Manchus themselves had forgotten this possible meaning."}
