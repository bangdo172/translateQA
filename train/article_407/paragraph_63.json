Dzungaria was fully opened to Han migration by the <a3_0>Qianlong<a3_0/> Emperor from the beginning.

Manchuria was originally separated from China proper by the Inner Willow Palisade, a ditch and embankment planted with willows intended to restrict the movement of the Han Chinese, as the area was off-limits to civilian Han Chinese until the government started colonizing the area, especially since the 1860s."}
