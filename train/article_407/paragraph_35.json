Wasteland was reclaimed by Han Chinese squatters in addition to other Han who rented land from Manchu landlords. Despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into <a0_0>Manchuria and Inner Mongolia<a0_0/> so that Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and <a1_0>tens of thousands of hectares<a1_0/> in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s. Qianlong allowed Han Chinese peasants suffering from drought to move into Manchuria despite him issuing edicts in favor of banning them from 1740\u20131776. Chinese tenant farmers rented or even claimed title to land from the <a2_0>\"imperial estates\" and Manchu Bannerlands<a2_0/> in the area. Besides moving into the Liao area in southern Manchuria, the path linking Jinzhou, Fengtian, Tieling, Changchun, Hulun, and Ningguta was settled by Han Chinese during the <a3_0>Qianlong<a3_0/> Emperor's rule, and Han Chinese were the majority in urban areas of Manchuria by 1800. To increase the Imperial Treasury's revenue, the Qing sold formerly Manchu only lands along the Sungari to <a4_0>Han Chinese<a4_0/> at the beginning of the Daoguang Emperor's reign, and Han Chinese filled up most of Manchuria's towns by the 1840s according to Abbe Huc."}
