Then, after capturing Beijing, instead of sacking the city as the rebels had done, <a0_0>Dorgon<a0_0/> insisted, over the protests of other Manchu princes, on making it the dynastic capital and reappointing most <a1_0>Ming<a1_0/> officials. Choosing Beijing as the capital had not been a straightforward decision, since no major Chinese dynasty had directly taken over its immediate predecessor's capital. Keeping the Ming capital and bureaucracy intact helped quickly <a2_0>stabilize the regime and sped up the conquest of the rest of the country<a2_0/>.
