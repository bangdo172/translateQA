The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including present day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \"China\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that \"China\" only meant Han areas. The Qing emperors proclaimed that both <a2_0>Han and non-Han peoples<a2_0/> were part of \"China.\" They used both \"China\" and \"Qing\" to refer to their state in official documents, international treaties (as the Qing was known internationally as \"China\" or the \"Chinese Empire\") and foreign affairs, and \"Chinese language\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) included Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4e4b\u4eba Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 zh\u012b r\u00e9n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all subjects of the empire. In the Chinese-language versions of its treaties and its maps of the world, the Qing government used \"Qing\" and \"China\" interchangeably."}
