The poetry of the Qing dynasty is a lively field of research, being studied (along with the poetry of the Ming dynasty) for its association with Chinese opera, developmental trends of Classical Chinese poetry, the transition to a greater role for vernacular language, and for poetry by women in Chinese culture. The Qing dynasty was a period of much literary collection and criticism, and many of the modern popular versions of Classical Chinese poems were transmitted through Qing dynasty anthologies, such as the Quantangshi and the Three Hundred Tang Poems. Pu Songling brought the short story form to a new level in his <a2_0>Strange Stories<a2_0/> from a Chinese Studio, published in the mid-18th century, and Shen Fu demonstrated the charm of the informal memoir in <a3_0>Six Chapters of a Floating Life<a3_0/>, written in the early 19th century but published only in 1877. The art of the novel reached a pinnacle in <a4_0>Cao Xueqin<a4_0/>'s Dream of the Red Chamber, but its combination of social commentary and psychological insight were echoed in highly skilled novels such as Wu Jingzi's The Scholars (1750) and Li Ruzhen's Flowers in the Mirror (1827)."}
