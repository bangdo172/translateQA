Kangxi's reign is also celebrated as the beginning of an era known as the \"<a2_0>High Qing<a2_0/>\", during which the dynasty reached the zenith of its social, economic and military power. Kangxi's long reign started when he was <a3_0>eight<a3_0/> years old upon the untimely demise of his father. To prevent a repeat of Dorgon's dictatorial monopolizing of power during the regency, the Shunzhi Emperor, on his deathbed, hastily appointed four senior cabinet ministers to govern on behalf of his young son. The four ministers \u2014 Sonin, Ebilun, Suksaha, and Oboi \u2014 were chosen for their long service, but also to counteract each other's influences. Most important, the four were not closely related to the imperial family and laid no claim to the throne. However, as time passed, through chance and machination, <a4_0>Oboi<a4_0/>, the most junior of the four, achieved such political dominance as to be a potential threat. Even though Oboi's loyalty was never an issue, his personal arrogance and political conservatism led him into an escalating conflict with the young emperor. In 1669 Kangxi, through trickery, disarmed and imprisoned Oboi \u2014 a significant victory for a fifteen-year-old emperor over a wily politician and experienced commander."}
