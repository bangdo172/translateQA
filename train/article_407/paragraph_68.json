Being a classically educated official, he took his blueprint for the Xiang Army from the Ming general <a0_0>Qi Jiguang<a0_0/>, who, because of the weakness of regular Ming troops, had decided to form his own \"private\" army to <a1_0>repel raiding Japanese pirates<a1_0/> in the mid-16th century. Qi Jiguang's doctrine was based on Neo-Confucian ideas of binding troops' loyalty to their immediate superiors and also to the regions in which they were raised. Zeng Guofan's original intention for the Xiang Army was simply to <a2_0>eradicate the Taiping rebels<a2_0/>. However, the success of the Yongying system led to its becoming a permanent regional force within the Qing military, which in the long run created problems for the beleaguered central government."}
