There are <a2_0>more than <b6_0><b8_0>6,000<b8_0/><b6_0/><a2_0/> ghost towns in the state of Kansas alone, according to Kansas historian Daniel Fitzgerald. This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region. In addition, the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities. The continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable, and there has been a proposal - the \"Buffalo Commons\" - to return approximately <a3_0>139,000 square miles<a3_0/> (360,000 km2) of these drier parts to native prairie land."}
