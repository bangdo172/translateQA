The provisions were expanded under the Kinkaid Act of <a3_0><b6_0>1904<b6_0/><a3_0/> to include a homestead of an entire section. <b8_0><b9_0>Hundreds of thousands<b9_0/><b8_0/> of people claimed such homesteads, sometimes building sod houses out of the very turf of their land. Many of them were not skilled dryland farmers and failures were frequent. Much of the Plains were settled during relatively wet years. Government experts did not understand how farmers should cultivate the prairies and gave advice counter to what would have worked[citation needed]. Germans from Russia who had previously farmed, under similar circumstances, in what is now Ukraine were marginally more successful than other homesteaders. The Dominion Lands Act of <a4_0><b7_0>1871<b7_0/><a4_0/> served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in Canada."}
