They (and Americans as well) also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain free farms. Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns, and those reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. In Kansas, for example, nearly <b6_0><b8_0>5000<b8_0/><b6_0/> towns were mapped out, but by 1970 only <b5_0><b7_0>617<b7_0/><b5_0/> were actually operating. In the mid-20th century, closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether a town would flourish or struggle for business."}
