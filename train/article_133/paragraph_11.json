Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new niche for <a1_0>mammals<a1_0/>, including many ungulates and glires, that switched from browsing diets to <a2_0>grazing diets<a2_0/>.

However, an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals, giving rise to the \"grit, not grass\" hypothesis."}
