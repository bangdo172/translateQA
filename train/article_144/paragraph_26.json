It also lacked <a1_0><b6_0>a hard disk drive<b6_0/><a1_0/> or the means to easily attach one. Many small companies sprang up to address the memory issue. Suggestions revolved around either upgrading the memory to 512 KB or removing the computer's 16 memory chips and replacing them with <a2_0><b7_0>larger-capacity chips<b7_0/><a2_0/>, a tedious and difficult operation. In October 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh 512K, with <a3_0><b8_0>quadruple<b8_0/><a3_0/> the memory of the original, at a price of US$3,195. It also offered an upgrade for 128k Macs that involved replacing <a4_0><b9_0>the logic board<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
