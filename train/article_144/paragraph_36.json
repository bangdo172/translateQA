However, the new iMac with its flexible LCD flat-panel monitor was considerably more expensive on its debut than the preceding iMac G3, largely due to the <a1_0><b6_0>higher cost of the LCD technology<b6_0/><a1_0/> at the time. In order to keep the Macintosh affordable for <a2_0><b7_0>the education market<b7_0/><a2_0/> and due to obsolescence of the iMac G3, Apple created the eMac in April 2002 as the intended successor; however the eMac's CRT made it <a3_0><b8_0>relatively bulky and somewhat outdated<b8_0/><a3_0/>, while its all-in-one construction meant it could not be expanded to meet consumer demand for larger monitors. The iMac G4's relatively high prices were approaching that of laptops which were portable and had higher resolution LCD screens. Meanwhile, Windows PC manufacturers could offer desktop configurations with LCD flat panel monitors at prices comparable to the eMac and at much lower cost than the iMac G4. The flop of the Power Mac G4 Cube, along with the more expensive iMac G4 and heavy eMac, meant that Macintosh desktop sales never reached the market share attained by the previous iMac G3. For the next half-decade while Macintosh sales held steady, it would instead be <a4_0>the <b9_0>iPod portable music player<b9_0/> and iTunes music download service<a4_0/> that would drive Apple's sales growth."}
