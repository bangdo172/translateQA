Even with its innovative design, it was initially priced US$200 higher than the comparably-equipped and more-expandable base Power Mac G4, while also not including a monitor, making it <a1_0><b6_0>too expensive<b6_0/><a1_0/> and resulting in slow sales. Apple sold just 29,000 Cubes in Q4 of 2000 which was <a4_0><b9_0>one third of expectations<b9_0/><a4_0/>, compared to 308,000 Macs during that same quarter, and Cube sales dropped to 12,000 units in Q1 of 2001. A price drop and hardware upgrades could not offset the <a2_0><b7_0>earlier perception<b7_0/><a2_0/> of the Cube's reduced value compared to the iMac and Power Mac G4 lineup, and it was discontinued in <a3_0><b8_0>July 2001<b8_0/><a3_0/>."}
