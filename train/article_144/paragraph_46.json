Macs did not natively support pointing devices that featured multiple buttons, even from third parties, until Mac OS X arrived in 2001. Apple continued to offer only single button mice, in both wired and Bluetooth wireless versions, until August 2005, when it introduced the <a1_0><b6_0>Mighty Mouse<b6_0/><a1_0/>. While it looked like a traditional one-button mouse, it actually had <a2_0><b7_0>four<b7_0/><a2_0/> buttons and a scroll ball, capable of independent x- and y-axis movement. A Bluetooth version followed in July 2006. In October 2009, Apple introduced the <a4_0><b9_0>Magic Mouse<b9_0/><a4_0/>, which uses <a3_0><b8_0>multi-touch gesture recognition<b8_0/><a3_0/> (similar to that of the iPhone) instead of a physical scroll wheel or ball. It is available only in a wireless configuration, but the wired Mighty Mouse (re-branded as \"Apple Mouse\") is still available as an alternative. Since 2010, Apple has also offered the Magic Trackpad as a means to control Macintosh desktop computers in a way similar to laptops."}
