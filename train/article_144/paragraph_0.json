Macintosh systems still found success in <a1_0><b6_0>education and desktop publishing<b6_0/><a1_0/> and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the 1990s, improvements in the rival <a2_0><b7_0>Wintel<b7_0/><a2_0/> platform, notably with the introduction of Windows 3.0, then Windows 95, gradually took market share from the more expensive Macintosh systems. The <a3_0><b8_0>performance<b8_0/><a3_0/> advantage of 68000-based Macintosh systems was eroded by Intel's Pentium, and in 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as <a4_0><b9_0>Compaq<b9_0/><a4_0/> became the top PC manufacturer. Even after a transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh (later renamed the PowerMac, in line with the PowerBook series) line in 1994, the falling prices of commodity PC components and the release of Windows 95 saw the Macintosh user base decline."}
