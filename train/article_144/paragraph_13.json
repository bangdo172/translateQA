The SE's expansion slot was located inside the case along with the CRT, potentially exposing an upgrader to <a3_0><b9_0>high voltage<b9_0/><a3_0/>. For this reason, Apple recommended users bring their SE to <a4_0>an authorized Apple dealer<a4_0/> to have upgrades performed. The SE also updated Jerry Manock and Terry Oyama's original design and shared the Macintosh II's Snow White design language, as well as the new Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) mouse and keyboard that had first appeared on the Apple IIGS some months earlier."}
