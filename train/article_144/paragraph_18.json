The company announced the <a3_0><b8_0>Macintosh 128K<b8_0/><a3_0/>\u2014manufactured at an <a1_0><b6_0>Apple factory in Fremont, California<b6_0/><a1_0/>\u2014in October 1983, followed by an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December. The Macintosh was introduced by a <a2_0><b7_0>US$1.5 million<b7_0/><a2_0/> Ridley Scott television commercial, \"1984\". It most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, and is now considered a \"watershed event\" and a \"masterpiece.\" Regis McKenna called the ad <a4_0><b9_0>\"more successful than the Mac itself.\"<b9_0/><a4_0/> \"1984\" used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the \"conformity\" of IBM's attempts to dominate the computer industry. The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised \"Big Brother.\""}
