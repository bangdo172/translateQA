He wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh, but the spelling was changed to \"Macintosh\" <a3_0><b8_0>for legal reasons<b8_0/><a3_0/> as the original was the same spelling as that used by McIntosh Laboratory, Inc., the <a4_0><b9_0>audio equipment<b9_0/><a4_0/> manufacturer. Steve Jobs requested that McIntosh Laboratory give Apple a release for the name with its changed spelling so that Apple could use it, but the request was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use the name. (A 1984 Byte Magazine article suggested Apple changed the spelling only after \"early users\" misspelled \"McIntosh\". However, Jef Raskin had adopted the Macintosh spelling by 1981, when the Macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab. This explanation further clashes with the first explanation given above that the change was made for \"legal reasons.\")"}
