Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from PowerPC chips (called Rosetta), much as it did during the transition from Motorola 68000 architecture a decade earlier. The <a0_0><b9_0>Macintosh<b9_0/><a0_0/> is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least <a1_0><a5_0><b10_0>8 GB<b10_0/><a5_0/><a1_0/> of RAM as standard other than the 1.4 GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use ATI Radeon or nVidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include <a7_0>two<a7_0/> standard data transfer ports: USB and <b11_0>Thunderbolt<b11_0/> (except for the MacBook (2015 version), which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the \"<a2_0>Thunderbolt<a2_0/>\" port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds <a8_0>up to 10 gigabits per second.<a8_0/> USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire is mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in <a3_0><b12_0>October 2005<b12_0/><a3_0/>, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called <a4_0><b13_0>Front Row<b13_0/><a4_0/> that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs."}
