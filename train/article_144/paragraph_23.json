It was given the code and rights to several applications, most notably MacWrite, MacPaint, and MacProject. In the late 1980s, Claris released a number of revamped software titles; the result was the <a1_0><b6_0>\"Pro\" series<b6_0/><a1_0/>, including MacDraw Pro, MacWrite Pro, and FileMaker Pro. To provide a complete office suite, Claris purchased the rights to the Informix Wingz spreadsheet program on the Mac, renaming it <a2_0><b7_0>Claris Resolve<b7_0/><a2_0/>, and added the new presentation software Claris Impact. By the early 1990s, Claris applications were shipping with the majority of consumer-level Macintoshes and were extremely popular. In 1991, Claris released ClarisWorks, which soon became their second best-selling application. When Claris was reincorporated back into Apple in <a4_0><b9_0>1998<b9_0/><a4_0/>, ClarisWorks was renamed <a3_0><b8_0>AppleWorks<b8_0/><a3_0/> beginning with version 5.0."}
