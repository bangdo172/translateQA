These models competed against <a1_0><b6_0>Macintosh clones<b6_0/><a1_0/>, hardware manufactured by third parties that ran Apple's System 7. This succeeded in increasing the Macintosh's <a3_0><b8_0>market share<b8_0/><a3_0/> somewhat, and provided <a2_0><b7_0>cheaper hardware<b7_0/><a2_0/> for consumers, but hurt <a4_0>Apple<a4_0/> financially as existing Apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of <b9_0>Apple<b9_0/>'s higher-margin Macintosh systems, yet Apple still shouldered the burden of developing the Mac OS platform."}
