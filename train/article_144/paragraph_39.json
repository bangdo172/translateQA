Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, he began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in 1981 <a0_0>over <b5_0>a personality conflict with Jobs<b5_0/><a0_0/>. Team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to <a1_0><b6_0>Jobs<b6_0/><a1_0/>' ideas than Raskin's. After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC, Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and its Smalltalk development tools in exchange for <a2_0><b7_0>Apple stock options<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at <a3_0><b8_0>Xerox PARC<b8_0/><a3_0/> and were combined with the Macintosh group's own ideas. Jobs also commissioned industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the \"Snow White\" design language; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers. However, Jobs' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last; after <a4_0><b9_0>an internal power struggle<b9_0/><a4_0/> with new CEO John Sculley, Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985. He went on to found NeXT, another computer company targeting the education market, and did not return until 1997, when Apple acquired NeXT."}
