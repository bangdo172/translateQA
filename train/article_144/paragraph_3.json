It offered one megabyte of RAM, easily expandable to four megabytes by the use of socketed RAM boards. It also featured a SCSI parallel interface, allowing up to seven peripherals\u2014such as hard drives and scanners\u2014to be attached to the machine. Its floppy drive was increased to an 800 kB capacity. <a0_0><b5_0>The Mac Plus<b5_0/><a0_0/> was an immediate success and remained in production, unchanged, until October 15, 1990; on sale for <a1_0><b6_0>just over four years and ten months<b6_0/><a1_0/>, it was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history. In September 1986, Apple introduced the <a2_0><b7_0>Macintosh Programmer's Workshop<b7_0/><a2_0/>, or MPW, an application that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than cross compiling from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled <a4_0><b9_0>HyperCard and MultiFinder<b9_0/><a4_0/>, which added <a3_0><b8_0>cooperative multitasking<b8_0/><a3_0/> to the Macintosh.
