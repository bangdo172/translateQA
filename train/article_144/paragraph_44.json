Its translucent plastic case, originally <a0_0><b5_0>Bondi blue<b5_0/><a0_0/> and later various additional colors, is considered an industrial design landmark of the late 1990s. The iMac did away with most of Apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as SCSI and ADB, in favor of <a1_0><b6_0>two USB ports<b6_0/><a1_0/>. It replaced a floppy disk drive with <a2_0><b7_0>a CD-ROM drive<b7_0/><a2_0/> for installing software, but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without <a3_0><b8_0>external third-party hardware<b8_0/><a3_0/>. The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with <a4_0><b9_0>800,000<b9_0/><a4_0/> units sold in 139 days. It made the company an annual profit of US$309 million, Apple's first profitable year since Michael Spindler took over as CEO in 1995. This aesthetic was applied to the Power Macintosh and later the iBook, Apple's first consumer-level laptop computer, filling the missing quadrant of Apple's \"four-square product matrix\" (desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals). More than 140,000 pre-orders were placed before it started shipping in September, and by October proved to be a large success."}
