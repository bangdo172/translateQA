The most common workaround, is to <a0_0><b5_0>boot into Mac OS and then to hand over control to a Mac OS-based bootloader application<b5_0/><a0_0/>. Used even by Apple for A/UX and MkLinux, this technique is no longer necessary since the introduction of <a1_0><b6_0>Open Firmware-based PCI Macs<b6_0/><a1_0/>, though it was formerly used for convenience on many Old World ROM systems due to <a2_0><b7_0>bugs in the firmware implementation<b7_0/><a2_0/>.[citation needed] Now, Mac hardware boots directly from <a4_0><b9_0>Open Firmware<b9_0/><a4_0/> in most PowerPC-based Macs or <a3_0><b8_0>EFI<b8_0/><a3_0/> in all Intel-based Macs."}
