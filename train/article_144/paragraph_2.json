While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such <a3_0>a bad condition<a3_0/> that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO <a4_0>John Sculley<a4_0/> to raise the price from US$1,995 to US$2,495 (about $5,200 when adjusted for inflation in 2010). The computer sold well, nonetheless, reportedly outselling the IBM PCjr which also began shipping early that year. By April 1984 the company sold 50,000 Macintoshes, and hoped for 70,000 by early May and almost 250,000 by the end of the year."}
