It was followed in 1989 by the <b6_0>Macintosh IIcx<b6_0/>, a more compact version with fewer slots  and a version of the Mac SE powered by the 16 MHz 68030, the Macintosh SE/30. Later that year, <a1_0>the Macintosh IIci<a1_0/>, running at 25 MHz, was the first Mac to be \"32-bit clean.\" This allowed it to natively support more than 8 MB of RAM, unlike its predecessors, which had \"32-bit dirty\" ROMs (8 of the 32 bits available for addressing were used for OS-level flags). System 7 was the first Macintosh operating system to support 32-bit addressing. The following year, the Macintosh IIfx, starting at <a2_0><b8_0>US$9,900<b8_0/><a2_0/>, was unveiled. Apart from its fast <a4_0><b9_0>40 MHz<b9_0/><a4_0/> 68030 processor, it had significant internal architectural improvements, including faster memory and <a3_0><b7_0>two<b7_0/><a3_0/> Apple II CPUs (6502s) dedicated to I/O processing."}
