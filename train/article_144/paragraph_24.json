It was first demonstrated by Steve Jobs in the first of his famous Mac keynote speeches, and though the Mac garnered an immediate, enthusiastic following, some labeled it a mere \"toy.\" Because the operating system was designed largely around the GUI, existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten. <a1_0><b6_0>This was a time-consuming task<b6_0/><a1_0/> that many software developers chose not to undertake, and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system. In April <a2_0><b7_0>1984<b7_0/><a2_0/>, Microsoft's MultiPlan migrated over from MS-DOS, with Microsoft Word following in January 1985. In <a3_0><b8_0>1985<b8_0/><a3_0/>, Lotus Software introduced Lotus Jazz for the Macintosh platform after the success of Lotus 1-2-3 for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop. Apple introduced the Macintosh Office suite the same year with the \"Lemmings\" ad. Infamous for <a4_0><b9_0>insulting its own potential customers<b9_0/><a4_0/>, the ad was not successful."}
