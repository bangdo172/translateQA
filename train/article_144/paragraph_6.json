Since Apple had licensed only System 7 to third parties, this move effectively ended <a2_0><b7_0>the clone line<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The decision caused <a3_0><b8_0>significant financial losses<b8_0/><a3_0/> for companies like Motorola, who produced the StarMax; Umax, who produced the SuperMac; and Power Computing, who offered several lines of Mac clones, including the PowerWave, PowerTower, and PowerTower Pro. These companies had invested substantial resources in creating their own Mac-compatible hardware. Apple bought out Power Computing's license, but allowed Umax to continue selling Mac clones until their license expired, as they had a sizeable presence in the lower-end segment that Apple did not. In September 1997 Apple extended Umax' license allowing them to sell clones with Mac OS 8, the only clone maker to do so, but with the restriction that they only sell low-end systems. Without the higher profit margins of high-end systems, however, Umax judged this would not be profitable and exited the Mac clone market in May 1998, having lost <a4_0><b9_0>USD$36 million<b9_0/><a4_0/> on the program."}
