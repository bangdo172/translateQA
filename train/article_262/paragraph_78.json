From about 1950 on (earlier for some large record companies, later for some small ones) it became usual to have the performance <a3_0>first recorded on audio tape, which could then be processed and/or edited, and then dubbed on to the master disc<a3_0/>. A <a0_0>record cutter<a0_0/> would engrave the grooves into the master disc. Early versions of these master discs were <a1_0>soft wax<a1_0/>, and later a <a2_0>harder lacquer<a2_0/> was used. The mastering process was originally something of an art as the operator had to manually allow for the changes in sound which affected how wide the space for the groove needed to be on each rotation."}
