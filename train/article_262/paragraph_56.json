In extreme cases, they can cause the needle to skip over a series of grooves, or worse yet, cause the needle to skip backwards, creating a \"<a2_0>locked groove<a2_0/>\" that repeats over and over. This is the origin of the phrase \"like a broken record\" or \"like a scratched record\", which is often used to describe a person or thing that continually repeats itself. Locked grooves are not uncommon and were even heard occasionally in radio broadcasts."}
