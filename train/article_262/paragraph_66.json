Empirically, and not by any formula, it was learned that the bass end of the audio spectrum <a2_0>below 100 Hz<a2_0/> could be boosted somewhat to override system hum and turntable rumble noises. Likewise at the treble end beginning at 1,000 Hz, if audio frequencies were boosted by 16 dB at 10,000 Hz the delicate sibilant sounds of speech and high overtones of musical instruments could survive the noise level of cellulose acetate, lacquer/aluminum, and vinyl disc media. When the record was played back <a3_0>using a complementary inverse curve<a3_0/>, signal-to-noise ratio was improved and the <a0_0>programming sounded more lifelike."}
