Robert Fine, <a0_0>Mercury Records<a0_0/> initiated a minimalist single microphone monaural recording technique in 1951. The first record, a Chicago Symphony Orchestra performance of Pictures at an Exhibition, conducted by Rafael Kubelik, was described as \"being in the living presence of the orchestra\" by The New York Times music critic. The series of records was then named Mercury Living Presence. In <a4_0>1955<a4_0/>, Mercury began three-channel stereo recordings, still based on the principle of the single microphone. <a3_0>The center<a3_0/> (single) microphone was of paramount importance, with the two side mics adding depth and space. Record masters were cut directly from a three-track to two-track mixdown console, with all editing of the master tapes done on the original three-tracks. In 1961, Mercury enhanced this technique with three-microphone stereo recordings using 35 mm magnetic film instead of half-inch tape for recording. The greater thickness and width of 35 mm magnetic film <a1_0>prevented tape layer print-through and pre-echo and gained extended frequency range and transient response<a1_0/>. The <a2_0>Mercury<a2_0/> Living Presence recordings were remastered to CD in the 1990s by the original producer, Wilma Cozart Fine, using the same method of 3-to-2 mix directly to the master recorder."}
