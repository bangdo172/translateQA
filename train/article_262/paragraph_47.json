An LP can play for up to 30 minutes per side, though most played for about <a4_0>22 minutes<a4_0/> per side, bringing the total playing time of a typical LP recording to about <a1_0>forty-five minutes<a1_0/>. Many pre-1952 LPs, however, played for about 15 minutes per side. The 7-inch 45 rpm format normally contains one item per side but a <a3_0>7-inch EP<a3_0/> could achieve recording times of 10 to 15 minutes at the expense of attenuating and compressing the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were generally used to make available tracks not on singles including tracks on <a2_0>LPs<a2_0/> albums in a smaller, less expensive format for those who had only 45 rpm players. The large center hole on 7-inch 45 rpm records allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. The term \"album\", originally used to mean a \"book\" with liner notes, holding several 78 rpm records each in its own \"page\" or sleeve, no longer has any relation to the physical format: a single LP record, or nowadays more typically a compact disc."}
