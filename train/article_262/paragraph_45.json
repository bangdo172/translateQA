The laser turntable <a1_0>eliminates record wear<a1_0/> and the possibility of accidental scratches, which <a2_0>degrade the sound<a2_0/>, but its expense limits use primarily to digital <a3_0>archiving of analog records<a3_0/>, and the laser does not play back colored vinyl or picture discs. Various other laser-based turntables were tried during the 1990s, but while a laser reads the groove very accurately, since it does not touch the record, the <a4_0>dust<a4_0/> that vinyl attracts due to static electric charge is not mechanically pushed out of the groove, worsening sound quality in casual use compared to conventional stylus playback."}
