In the late 1930s, radio commercials and pre-recorded radio programs being sent to disc jockeys started being stamped in <a3_0><a4_0>vinyl<a4_0/><a3_0/>, so they would not break in the mail. In the mid-1940s, special DJ copies of records started being made of <a1_0>vinyl<a1_0/> also, for the same reason. These were all 78 rpm. During and after <a2_0>World War II<a2_0/>, when shellac supplies were extremely limited, some 78 rpm records were pressed in vinyl instead of shellac, particularly the six-minute 12-inch (30 cm) 78 rpm records produced by V-Disc for distribution to United States troops in World War II. In the 1940s, radio transcriptions, which were usually on 16-inch records, but sometimes 12-inch, were always made of vinyl, but cut at 33 1\u20443 rpm. Shorter transcriptions were often cut at 78 rpm."}
