The early electric recordings were reminiscent tonally of acoustic recordings, except there was more recorded bass and treble as well as delicate sounds and overtones cut on the records. This was in spite of some <a2_0>carbon microphones used,<a2_0/> which had resonances that colored the recorded tone. The double button carbon microphone with stretched diaphragm was a marked improvement.
