With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and <a0_0>limiting the playing time<a0_0/> of the record. At high frequencies, <a1_0>hiss, pops, and ticks<a1_0/> are significant. These <a3_0>problems can be reduced<a3_0/> by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the <a2_0>amplitude of low frequencies is reduced<a2_0/>, thus reducing the groove width required, and the <a4_0>amplitude at high frequencies is increased<a4_0/>. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced."}
