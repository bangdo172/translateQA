This is a form of frequency multiplexing as the control signal (restoring force) used to keep the stylus in the groove is carried by the same mechanism as the sound itself. Subsonic <a3_0>frequencies below about 20 Hz<a3_0/> in the audio signal are dominated by tracking effects, which is one form of unwanted rumble (\"tracking noise\") and merges with audible frequencies in the deep bass range up to about 100 Hz. High fidelity sound equipment can reproduce tracking noise and rumble. During a quiet passage, woofer speaker <a4_0>cones can sometimes be seen to vibrate with the subsonic tracking<a4_0/> of the stylus, at frequencies as low as just above 0.5 Hz (the frequency at which a 33 1\u20443 rpm record turns on the turntable; 5\u20449 Hz exactly on an ideal turntable). Another reason for very low frequency material can be a <a0_0>warped disk<a0_0/>: its undulations produce frequencies of only a few hertz and present day amplifiers have large power bandwidths. For this reason, many stereo receivers contained a switchable <a1_0>subsonic filter<a1_0/>. Some subsonic content is directly out of phase in each channel. If played back on a mono subwoofer system, the noise will cancel, significantly reducing the amount of rumble that is reproduced."}
