At least one manufacturer in the early 1920s, <a0_0>World Records<a0_0/>, produced records that played at a constant linear velocity, controlled by <a1_0>Noel Pemberton Billing's patented add-on governor device<a1_0/>. As these were <a2_0>played from the outside to the inside<a2_0/>, the rotational speed of the records increased as reproduction progressed. This action is similar (although in reverse) to that on the modern compact disc and the CLV version of its predecessor, the <a3_0>Philips Laser Disc<a3_0/>."}
