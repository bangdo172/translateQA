It had a flatter audio response than the old style Wente condenser type and <a2_0>didn't require electronics installed in the microphone housing<a2_0/>. Signals fed to the cutting head were pre-emphasized in the treble region to help <a3_0>override noise in playback<a3_0/>. Groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts. The chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch that could be crowded together, resulting in <a0_0>longer playback time<a0_0/>. Additionally, the problem of <a1_0>inner groove distortion<a1_0/>, which plagued lateral cuts, could be avoided with the vertical cut system. Wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus <a4_0>avoiding the microscopic irregularities<a4_0/> of cast blocks of wax and the necessity of planing and polishing."}
