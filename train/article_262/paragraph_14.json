At the beginning of the 20th century, the early discs played for <a1_0>two minutes<a1_0/>, the same as early cylinder records. The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to <a4_0>three and a half minutes<a4_0/>. Because a <a3_0>10-inch<a3_0/> 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. For example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded <a2_0>13<a2_0/> sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52\u20132:59."}
