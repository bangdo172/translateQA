Rather than having the proper <a1_0>mirror-like<a1_0/> finish, the surface of the record will have a texture that looks like orange peel. This introduces noise into the record, particularly in the <a3_0>lower frequency range<a3_0/>. With direct metal mastering (DMM), the master disc is cut on a <a4_0>copper<a4_0/>-coated disc, which can also have a minor \"orange peel\" effect on the disc itself. As this \"orange peel\" originates in the master rather than being introduced in the pressing stage, <a2_0>there is no ill effect<a2_0/> as there is no physical distortion of the groove."}
