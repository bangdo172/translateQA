These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the <a3_0>Amberol cylinder<a3_0/> in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4\u00bd minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of <a4_0>celluloid<a4_0/>, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new <a0_0>Blue Amberol cylinders<a0_0/> for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By <a1_0>1919<a1_0/> the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the <a2_0>digital compact disc<a2_0/> in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing)."}
