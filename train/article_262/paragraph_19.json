One of the first attempts at this was in the 1950s, when inventor <a4_0>Ewing Dunbar Nunn<a4_0/> founded the label Audiophile Records, which released, in addition to standard 33 1/3 rpm LPs, 78 rpm-mastered albums that were microgroove and pressed on vinyl (as opposed to traditional 78s, with their shellac composition and wider 3-mil sized grooves). This was done by the label mainly to take advantage of the wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78 rpm can provide for vinyl microgroove records, hence the label's name (obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s \"hi-fi\" era, when stereo gear could provide a much <a3_0>wider range of audio<a3_0/> than before). Also in the late 1950s, <a2_0>Bell Records<a2_0/> released a few budget-priced 7\" microgrooved records at 78 rpm."}
