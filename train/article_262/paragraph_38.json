The ultimately dominant \"45/45\" <a0_0>stereophonic record system<a0_0/> was invented by Alan Blumlein of EMI in <a3_0>1931<a3_0/> and patented the same year. EMI cut the first stereo test discs using the system in <a1_0>1933<a1_0/> (see Bell Labs Stereo Experiments of 1933) although the system <a4_0>was not exploited commercially until much later."}
