G. A. H. Voigt<a0_0/> (1940) showed that the early Wente-style condenser microphones contributed to a 4 to 6 dB midrange brilliance or <a1_0>pre-emphasis in the recording<a1_0/> chain. This meant that the electrical recording characteristics of Western Electric licensees such as Columbia Records and Victor Talking Machine Company in the <a4_0>1925 era<a4_0/> had a higher amplitude in the midrange region. Brilliance such as this compensated for dullness in many early magnetic pickups having drooping midrange and treble response. As a result, this practice was the empirical beginning of using pre-emphasis <a2_0>above 1,000 Hz<a2_0/> in <a3_0>78 rpm and 33 1\u20443 rpm<a3_0/> records."}
