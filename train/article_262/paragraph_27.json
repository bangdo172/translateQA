This motor ran at <a2_0>3600 rpm<a2_0/>, such that a <a0_0>46:1<a0_0/> gear ratio would produce 78.26 rpm. In parts of the world that used 50 Hz current, the standard was 77.92 rpm (3,000 rpm with a 77:2 ratio), which was also the speed at which a strobe disc with 77 lines would \"stand still\" in 50 Hz light (92 lines for 60 Hz). After World War II these records were retroactively known as 78s, <a3_0>to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats<a3_0/>. Earlier they were just called records, or when there was a need to distinguish them from cylinders, disc records."}
