Distant or less strong sounds that were impossible to record by the old methods could now be captured. Volume was now limited only by the groove spacing on the record and the limitations of the intended playback device. Victor and Columbia licensed the new electrical system from Western Electric and began issuing electrically recorded discs in <a2_0>1925<a2_0/>. The first classical recording was of Chopin impromptus and Schubert's Litanei by Alfred Cortot for Victor."}
