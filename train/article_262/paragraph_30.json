The 33 1\u20443 rpm LP (for \"long-play\") format was developed by <a1_0>Columbia Records<a1_0/> and marketed in <a2_0>June 1948<a2_0/>. RCA Victor developed the 45 rpm format and marketed it in <a3_0>March 1949<a3_0/>, each pursuing their own r&d in secret. Both types of new disc used narrower grooves, intended to be played with smaller stylus\u2014typically 0.001 inches (25 \u00b5m) wide, compared to 0.003 inches (76 \u00b5m) for a 78\u2014so the new records were sometimes called Microgroove. In the <a4_0>mid-1950s<a4_0/> all record companies agreed to a common recording standard called RIAA equalization. Prior to the establishment of the standard each company used its own preferred standard, requiring discriminating listeners to use pre-amplifiers with multiple selectable equalization curves."}
