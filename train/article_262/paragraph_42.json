These techniques, marketed, to name two, as the <a0_0>CBS DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering<a0_0/>, were used to reduce inner-groove distortion. <a1_0>RCA Victor<a1_0/> introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of Dynagroove. Two main elements were combined: another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise. Sometimes this was called \"diaphragming\" the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its <a2_0>unnatural side effects<a2_0/>. Both elements were reflected in the brandname of Dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. It also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk. <a3_0>Lower recorded volume<a3_0/> used closer spacing; higher recorded volume used <a4_0>wider spacing<a4_0/>, especially with lower frequencies. Also, the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end farther away from the disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further."}
