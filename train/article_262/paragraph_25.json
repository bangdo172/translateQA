The short playing time of a single 45 rpm side meant that long works, such as symphonies, had to be released on multiple 45s instead of a single LP, but RCA claimed that the new high-speed changer rendered side breaks so brief as to be inaudible or inconsequential. Early 45 rpm records were made from either <a1_0>vinyl or polystyrene<a1_0/>. They had a playing time of <a2_0>eight minutes<a2_0/>."}
