Only one disc actually saw release, Randy Newman's I <a1_0>Think It's Going to Rain Today<a1_0/>, a track from his self-titled debut album (with The Beehive State on the flipside). Reprise did not proceed further with the series due to a <a4_0>lack of sales for the single, and a lack of general interest<a4_0/> in the concept. Guitarist & vocalist Leon Redbone released a promotional 78 rpm record in 1978 featuring two songs (<a2_0>Alabama Jubilee and Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone<a2_0/>) from his Champagne Charlie album. In 1980 <a3_0>Stiff Records<a3_0/> in the United Kingdom issued a 78 by Joe \"King\" Carrasco containing the songs Buena (Spanish for \"good,\" with the alternate spelling \"Bueno\" on the label) and Tuff Enuff. Underground comic cartoonist and 78 rpm record collector Robert Crumb released three discs with his Cheap Suit Serenaders in the 1980s."}
