The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by <a1_0>the <b6_0>superior range, flexibility and effectiveness<b6_0/><a1_0/> of carrier-launched aircraft. <a2_0><b7_0>They had higher range and precision<b7_0/><a2_0/> than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling <a3_0><b8_0>the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes<b8_0/><a3_0/>. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by <a4_0><b9_0>the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships<b9_0/><a4_0/> during the Norwegian campaign in 1940."}
