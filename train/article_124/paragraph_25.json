While the island is usually built on the <a2_0><b7_0>starboard<b7_0/><a2_0/> side of the fight deck, the Japanese aircraft carriers Akagi and Hiry\u016b had their islands built on the port side. Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island. The flush deck configuration proved to have significant drawbacks, primary of which was <a3_0><b8_0>management of the exhaust from the power plant<b8_0/><a3_0/>. <a4_0><b9_0>Fumes coming across the deck<b9_0/><a4_0/> were a major issue in USS Langley. In addition, lack of an island meant difficulties managing the flight deck, performing air traffic control, a lack of radar housing placements and problems with navigating and controlling the ship itself."}
