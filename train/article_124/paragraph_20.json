In 1918, <a1_0><b6_0>HMS Argus<b6_0/><a1_0/> became the world's first carrier capable of launching and recovering naval aircraft.

These conversions gave rise to the <a4_0><b9_0>Lexington-class<b9_0/><a4_0/> aircraft carriers (1927), Akagi and Courageous class. Specialist carrier evolution was well underway, with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s, resulting in the commissioning of ships such as H\u014dsh\u014d (1922), HMS Hermes (1924), and B\u00e9arn (1927). During World War II, these ships would become known as fleet carriers.[citation needed]"}
