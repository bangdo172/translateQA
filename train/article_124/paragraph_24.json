The arrested-recovery system has used an angled deck since the 1950s because, in case the aircraft does not catch the arresting wire, the short deck allows easier take off by reducing the number of objects between the aircraft and the end of the runway. It also has the advantage of separating the recovery operation area from <a1_0><b6_0>the launch area<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Helicopters and <a2_0><b7_0>aircraft capable of vertical or short take-off and landing<b7_0/><a2_0/> (V/STOL) usually recover by coming abreast the carrier on the port side and then using their <a3_0><b8_0>hover<b8_0/><a3_0/> capability to move over the flight deck and land vertically without the need for <a4_0><b9_0>arresting gear<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
