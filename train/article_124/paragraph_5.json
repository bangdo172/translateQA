This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft <a1_0><b6_0>take off at far higher weights<b6_0/><a1_0/> than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by <a2_0><b7_0>the Royal Navy<b7_0/><a2_0/>, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting <a3_0><b8_0>some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity<b8_0/><a3_0/> and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before <a4_0><b9_0>either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
