These are the largest carriers capable of fast speeds. By comparison, escort carriers were developed <a2_0>to <b7_0>provide defense for convoys of ships<b7_0/><a2_0/>. They were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried. Most were built from <a3_0><b8_0>mercantile hulls<b8_0/><a3_0/> or, in the case of merchant aircraft carriers, were bulk cargo ships with a flight deck added on top. Light aircraft carriers were carriers that were fast enough to operate with the fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity. Soviet aircraft carriers now in use by Russia are actually called <a4_0><b9_0>heavy aviation cruisers<b9_0/><a4_0/>, these ships while sized in the range of large fleet carriers were designed to deploy alone or with escorts and provide both strong defensive weaponry and heavy offensive missiles equivalent to a guided missile cruiser in addition to supporting fighters and helicopters."}
