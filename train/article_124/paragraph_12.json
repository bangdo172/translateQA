Non-VTOL or <a0_0>conventional aircraft <b5_0>cannot decelerate on their own<b5_0/><a0_0/>, and almost all carriers using them must have arrested-recovery systems (-BAR, e.g. CATOBAR or STOBAR) <a1_0>to <b6_0>recover their aircraft<b6_0/><a1_0/>.

Post-WWII Royal Navy research on safer CATOBAR recovery eventually led to universal adoption of a landing area angled off axis to allow aircraft who missed the arresting wires to \"<a3_0><b8_0>bolt<b8_0/><a3_0/>\" and safely return to flight for another landing attempt rather than <a4_0><b9_0>crashing into aircraft on the forward deck<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
