Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. <a2_0><b7_0>The flight deck<b7_0/><a2_0/> is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier \u2013 for example, the fact that it is a ship means that <a3_0><b8_0>a full-length runway would be costly to construct and maintain<b8_0/><a3_0/>. This affects take-off procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft <a4_0><b9_0>accelerate more quickly to gain lift<b9_0/><a4_0/>. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced take-off load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself."}
