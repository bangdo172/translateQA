The main new features are implementation of <a1_0><b6_0>Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS)<b6_0/><a1_0/> (which replace the old steam catapults) and unmanned aerial vehicles. With the deactivation of USS Enterprise in December 2012 (decommissioning scheduled for <a2_0><b7_0>2016<b7_0/><a2_0/>), the U.S. fleet comprises 10 active supercarriers. On 24 July 2007, the House Armed Services Seapower subcommittee recommended seven or eight new carriers (one every four years). However, the debate has deepened over budgeting for the $12\u201314.5 billion (plus $12 billion for development and research) for the <a3_0><b8_0>100,000 ton<b8_0/><a3_0/> Gerald R.
