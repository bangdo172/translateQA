Later on in August 2013 Vice Admiral RK Dhowan, while talking about the detailed study underway on the IAC-II project, said that nuclear propulsion was also being considered. The navy also evaluated the <a0_0><b5_0>Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System<b5_0/><a0_0/> (EMALS), which is being used by the US Navy in their latest Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. <a1_0><b6_0>General Atomics<b6_0/><a1_0/>, the developer of the EMALS, was cleared by the US government to give a technical demonstration to <a3_0><b8_0>Indian Navy officers<b8_0/><a3_0/>, who were impressed by the new capabilities of the system. The EMALS enables launching <a2_0><b7_0>varied aircraft including unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV)<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The aim is to have a total of <a4_0><b9_0>three<b9_0/><a4_0/> aircraft carriers in service, with two fully operational carriers and the third in refit."}
