This is also known as antagonistic or antipathetic symbiosis. Parasitic symbioses take many forms, from endoparasites that live within the host's body to ectoparasites that live on its surface. In addition, parasites may be <a1_0><b6_0>necrotrophic<b6_0/><a1_0/>, which is to say they kill their host, or <a2_0>biotrophic<a2_0/>, meaning they rely on their host's surviving. <b8_0>Biotrophic parasitism<b8_0/> is an extremely successful mode of life. Depending on the definition used, <a3_0><b9_0>as many as half<b9_0/><a3_0/> of all animals have at least one parasitic phase in their life cycles, and it is also frequent in plants and fungi. Moreover, almost all free-living animals are host to one or more parasite taxa. An example of a <b5_0>biotrophic relationship would be <a4_0>a tick<a4_0/> feeding on the blood of its host<b5_0/>."}
