A clear case of amensalism is where sheep or cattle trample grass. Whilst the presence of the grass causes negligible detrimental effects to the animal's hoof, the grass suffers from being crushed. Amensalism is often used to describe strongly asymmetrical competitive interactions, such as has been observed between the <b5_0>Spanish<b5_0/> ibex and <a0_0>weevils<a0_0/> of the genus <b7_0>Timarcha<b7_0/> which feed upon the same type of <a1_0>shrub<a1_0/>. Whilst the presence of the weevil has almost no influence on <b6_0>food availability<b6_0/>, the presence of ibex has an enormous detrimental effect on weevil numbers, as they consume significant quantities of plant matter and incidentally ingest the weevils upon it."}
