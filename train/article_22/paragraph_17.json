This type of symbiosis is relatively uncommon in rudimentary reference texts, but is omnipresent in the natural world.[citation needed] There are two types of <b8_0>amensalism, <a1_0><a2_0>competition<b8_0/><a2_0/> and antibiosis<a1_0/>. <b4_0>Competition<b4_0/> is where a larger or stronger organisms deprives a smaller or weaker one from a resource. <b6_0>Antibiosis<b6_0/> occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion. An example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree. The mature tree can begin to rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and, if the mature tree is very large, it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients. Throughout the process the mature tree is unaffected. Indeed, if the sapling dies, the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling. Note that these nutrients become available because of the sapling's decomposition, rather than from the living sapling, which would be a case of parasitism.[citation needed] An example of antibiosis is Juglans nigra (<b7_0>black walnut<b7_0/>), secreting <a3_0>juglone<a3_0/>, a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone."}
