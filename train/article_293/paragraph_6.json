As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and <b8_0>William Burnside<b8_0/>, who worked on representation theory of finite groups, Richard Brauer's <b7_0>modular representation<b7_0/> theory and Issai Schur's papers. <a2_0>The theory of Lie groups<a2_0/>, and more generally locally compact groups was studied by <b5_0>Hermann Weyl<b5_0/>, \u00c9lie Cartan and many others. Its algebraic counterpart, <b6_0>the theory of algebraic groups<b6_0/>, was first shaped by <a3_0>Claude Chevalley<a3_0/> (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of Armand Borel and Jacques Tits."}
