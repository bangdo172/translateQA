The operation satisfies four conditions called the <a1_0><b4_0>group axioms<b4_0/><a1_0/>, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is <b7_0>the set of integers together with the addition operation<b7_0/>, but the <a2_0>abstract formalization of the group axioms<a2_0/>, detached as it is from <b5_0>the concrete nature<b5_0/> of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely. It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining <b6_0>their essential structural aspects<b6_0/>. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics."}
