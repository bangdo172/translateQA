The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy. <a3_0>Arthur Cayley<a3_0/>'s On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation <b8_0>\u03b8n = 1 (1854)<b8_0/> gives the first abstract definition of a finite group."}
