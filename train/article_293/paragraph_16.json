The result of <b5_0>modular addition<b5_0/> is <a1_0>the remainder of that division<a1_0/>. For any modulus, n, the set of integers from 0 to n \u2212 1 forms a group under modular addition: the inverse of any element a is n \u2212 a, and 0 is the <b6_0>identity element<b6_0/>. This is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of <a2_0>a clock<a2_0/>: if the hour hand is on <b7_0>9<b7_0/> and is advanced 4 hours, it ends up on 1, as shown at the right.
