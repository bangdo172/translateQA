For example, <a1_0><b5_0>Henri Poincar\u00e9<b5_0/><a1_0/> founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing <a2_0>the fundamental group<a2_0/>. By means of this connection, topological properties such as <a3_0><b6_0>proximity and continuity<b6_0/><a3_0/> translate into properties of groups.i[\u203a] For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by <a4_0>loops<a4_0/>. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because <b7_0>it can be continuously shrunk to a point<b7_0/>. <b8_0>The presence of the hole<b8_0/> prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. <b9_0>The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted<b9_0/> turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole."}
