According to <a2_0>Lagrange's theorem<a2_0/>, finite groups of order p, a prime number, are necessarily cyclic (abelian) groups Zp. Groups of order p2 can also be shown to be <b5_0>abelian<b5_0/>, a statement which does not generalize to order p3, as the non-abelian group D4 of order 8 = 23 above shows. <a3_0><b6_0>Computer algebra systems<b6_0/><a3_0/> can be used to list small groups, but there is no classification of all finite groups.q[\u203a] An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups.r[\u203a] A nontrivial group is called simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself.s[\u203a] <a4_0>The <b9_0>Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder<b9_0/> theorem<a4_0/> exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups.
