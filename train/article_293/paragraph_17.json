That is, <b6_0>the usual product<b6_0/> is divided by <b4_0>p<b4_0/> and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication. For example, if p = 5, there are <a2_0><b5_0>four<b5_0/> group elements<a2_0/> 1, 2, 3, 4. In this group, 4 \u00b7 4 = 1, because the usual product 16 is equivalent to <b7_0>1<b7_0/>, which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1. for 5 divides 16 \u2212 1 = 15, denoted"}
