An important class is the symmetric groups SN, the groups of permutations of N letters. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters S3 is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters ABC, i.e. contains the elements ABC, ACB, ..., up to CBA, in total 6 (or 3 factorial) elements. This class is <a2_0>fundamental<a2_0/> insofar as <b6_0>any finite group<b6_0/> can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group SN for a suitable integer N (Cayley's theorem). Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, <a3_0>S3<a3_0/> can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an <b7_0>equilateral triangle<b7_0/>."}
