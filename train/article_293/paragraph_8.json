This compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways. For example, groups can be related to each other via functions called <a2_0><b5_0>group homomorphisms<b5_0/><a2_0/>. By the mentioned principle, they are required to respect the group structures in a <b6_0>precise<b6_0/> sense. The structure of groups can also be understood by breaking them into pieces called subgroups and <b7_0>quotient groups<b7_0/>. The principle of \"preserving structures\"\u2014a recurring topic in mathematics throughout\u2014is an instance of working in a category, in this case the category of groups."}
