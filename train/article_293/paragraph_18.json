Indeed, each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are 1. <a1_0>Any cyclic group with n elements<a1_0/> is <b3_0>isomorphic<b3_0/> to this group. A second example for cyclic groups is <a2_0>the group of n-th complex roots of unity<a2_0/>, given by complex numbers z satisfying zn = 1. These numbers can be visualized as the <b7_0>vertices<b7_0/> on a regular n-gon, as shown in blue at the right for n = 6. The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers. In the picture, multiplying with z corresponds to <b6_0>a counter-clockwise rotation by 60\u00b0<b6_0/>. Using some field theory, the group Fp\u00d7 can be shown to be cyclic: for example, if p = 5, 3 is a generator since 31 = 3, 32 = 9 \u2261 4, 33 \u2261 2, and 34 \u2261 1."}
