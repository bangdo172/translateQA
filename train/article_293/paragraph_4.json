Each of these <a0_0>functions<a0_0/> sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry. For example, r1 sends a point to its rotation <b7_0>90\u00b0<b7_0/> clockwise around the square's center, and fh sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line. <a1_0>Composing two of these symmetry functions<a1_0/> gives another symmetry function. These symmetries determine a group called <a2_0>the <b4_0>dihedral<b4_0/> group<a2_0/> of degree 4 and denoted D4. The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetry functions, and the group operation is function composition. Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to <b5_0>the square<b5_0/>, and the second one to the result of the first application. The result of performing first <b6_0>a and then b<b6_0/> is written symbolically from right to left as"}
