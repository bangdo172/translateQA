An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the <a2_0><b6_0>Curie temperature<b6_0/><a2_0/> and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectic state, accompanied by a so-called <a3_0><b8_0>soft phonon mode<b8_0/><a3_0/>, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to <b7_0>zero<b7_0/> frequency at the transition."}
