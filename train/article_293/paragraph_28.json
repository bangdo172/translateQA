They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models\u2014imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description.v[\u203a] Another example are the <a3_0><b8_0>Lorentz transformations<b8_0/><a3_0/>, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves\u2014in the absence of significant gravitation\u2014as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e. including translations, is known as the <a4_0><b9_0>Poincar\u00e9 group<b9_0/><a4_0/>. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory."}
