From the late <a2_0>18th century<a2_0/> onwards, Orlam clans from the Cape Colony crossed the <a0_0>Orange River<a0_0/> and moved into the area that today is <a1_0>southern Namibia<a1_0/>. Their encounters with the <b5_0><b7_0><b8_0>nomadic<b8_0/><b7_0/><b5_0/> Nama tribes were largely peaceful. The missionaries accompanying the Orlams were well received by them, the right to use waterholes and grazing was granted against an annual payment. On their way further northwards, however, the Orlams encountered clans of the Herero tribe at Windhoek, Gobabis, and Okahandja which were less accommodating. The Nama-Herero War broke out in <a3_0><b6_0>1880<b6_0/><a3_0/>, with hostilities ebbing only when <a4_0>Imperial Germany<a4_0/> deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo between Nama, Orlams, and Herero."}
