Also in the square are the glass-faced Planalto Palace housing the <a0_0>presidential offices<a0_0/>, and the Palace of the Supreme Court.

Between the federal and civic buildings on the Monumental Axis is the city's cathedral, considered by many to be Niemeyer's finest achievement (see photographs of the interior). The parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its <b7_0>16 gracefully curving supports<b7_0/>, which join in a circle 115 feet (35 meters) above the floor of the nave; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass. The nave is entered via <b8_0>a subterranean passage<b8_0/> rather than conventional doorways. Other notable buildings are Buriti Palace, Itamaraty Palace, the National Theater, and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture. The Brazilian landscape architect <a3_0>Roberto Burle Marx<a3_0/> designed <b5_0>landmark <a4_0>modernist<a4_0/> gardens<b5_0/> for <b6_0>some of the principal buildings<b6_0/>."}
