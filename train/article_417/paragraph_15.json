The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Bras\u00edlia, by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in <a1_0><b6_0>1958<b6_0/><a1_0/>. One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, <b8_0>the \"Alvorada\"<b8_0/> lies on a peninsula at the margins of Lake Parano\u00e1. <b9_0>The principles of <a2_0>simplicity and modernity<b9_0/><a2_0/>, that in the past characterized the great works of architecture, motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of <a3_0><b5_0>7,000 m2<b5_0/><a3_0/> with <a4_0><b7_0>three<b7_0/><a4_0/> floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor. The auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings."}
