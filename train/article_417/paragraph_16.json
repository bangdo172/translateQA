It is located at the Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes in Bras\u00edlia. As the seat of government, the term <b9_0>\"Planalto\"<b9_0/> is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto. The President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the \"Planalto,\" including <b7_0>the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff<b7_0/>. The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Minist\u00e9rios. The architect of the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto was <a3_0>Oscar Niemeyer<a3_0/>, creator of most of the important buildings in Bras\u00edlia. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is <a0_0><b5_0>four<b5_0/><a0_0/> stories high, and has an area of <a1_0><b6_0>36,000 m2<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex."}
