Operating systems from Digital Equipment Corporation, for example, <a1_0><b5_0>interpreted DEL as an input character as meaning \"remove previously-typed input character<b5_0/>\"<a1_0/>, and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems. Most other systems used <a3_0><b6_0>BS<b6_0/><a3_0/> for that meaning and used DEL to mean \"<a2_0><b7_0>remove the character at the cursor<b7_0/><a2_0/>\".[citation needed] That latter interpretation is the most common now.[citation needed]"}
