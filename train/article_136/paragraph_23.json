Mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the Remington No. 2 (<a0_0><b4_0>1878<b4_0/><a0_0/>), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of 23456789- were \"#$%_&'() \u2013  early typewriters omitted 0 and 1, <a1_0><b5_0>using O (capital letter o) and l (lowercase letter L) instead<a1_0/>,<b5_0/> but 1! and 0) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. Thus, in ASCII !\"#$% were placed in second column, rows 1\u20135, corresponding to the digits 1\u20135 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing _ (underscore) from 6 and shifting the remaining characters left, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9. This discrepancy from typewriters led to bit-paired keyboards, notably the Teletype Model 33, <a2_0><b6_0>which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII<b6_0/><a2_0/>, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the more recently introduced IBM Selectric (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers\u2014\u200b\u200bfollowing the IBM PC (1981), especially Model M (1984)\u2014\u200b\u200band thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards <a3_0>do not correspond as closely<a3_0/> to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The /? pair also dates to the No. 2, and the ,< .> pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift , (comma) or . (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the ;: pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly -* =+) to :* ;+ -=."}
