This allows <a2_0><b5_0>UTF-8<b5_0/><a2_0/> to be backward compatible with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to <b7_0>an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters<b7_0/>. Even more importantly, forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged."}
