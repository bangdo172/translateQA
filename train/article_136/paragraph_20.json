Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since <a2_0><b6_0>ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries<b6_0/><a2_0/>. For example, <b8_0>Canada<b8_0/> had its own version that supported French characters. Other adapted encodings include ISCII (India), VISCII (Vietnam), and YUSCII (Yugoslavia). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, <a3_0><b7_0>true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard<b7_0/><a3_0/>."}
