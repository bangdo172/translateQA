For this reason, EOF, or <a1_0>end-of-file<a1_0/>, was used colloquially and conventionally as a three-letter acronym for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute. The end-of-text code (ETX), also known as <a3_0><b6_0>Control-C<b6_0/><a3_0/>, was inappropriate for a variety of reasons, while using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to <b8_0>it ending the alphabet<b8_0/> and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid. A historically common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX code convention <a2_0><b5_0>to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from <b7_0>a keyboard<b7_0/><b5_0/><a2_0/>."}
