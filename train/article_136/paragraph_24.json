Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied. The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was <a2_0><b5_0>to make it an ignored character<b5_0/><a2_0/>, the same as NUL (all zeroes). This was useful specifically for paper tape, because <b7_0>punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it<b7_0/>. Tapes designed to be \"hand edited\" could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be \"rubbed out\" and then replacements <b6_0>put into the empty space<b6_0/>."}
