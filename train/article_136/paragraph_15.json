The \"escape\" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally <a0_0>to allow <b3_0>sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning<b3_0/><a0_0/>. This is the same meaning of \"escape\" encountered in URL encodings, C language strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, usually in the form of <b7_0>a so-called \"ANSI escape code\"<b7_0/> (or, more properly, a \"Control Sequence Introducer\") beginning with ESC followed by a \"[\" (left-bracket) character. <b5_0>An ESC sent from the terminal<b5_0/> is <a1_0>most often used as an out-of-band character used to terminate an operation<a1_0/>, as in the TECO and vi text editors. <b6_0>In graphical user interface (GUI) and windowing systems<b6_0/>, ESC generally causes <a2_0><b4_0>an application to abort its current operation or to exit (terminate) altogether<b4_0/><a2_0/>."}
