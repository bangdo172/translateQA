Work on the ASCII standard began on <a2_0><b7_0>October 6, 1960<b7_0/><a2_0/>, with the first meeting of the American Standards Association's (ASA) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published during <a3_0><b8_0>1963<b8_0/><a3_0/>, underwent a major revision during <a4_0><b9_0>1967<b9_0/><a4_0/>, and experienced its most recent update during 1986. Compared to earlier telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., alphabetization) of lists, and added features for devices other than teleprinters."}
