Lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase. <b8_0>To keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics<b8_0/>, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter A was placed in position <a3_0><b7_0>41hex<b7_0/><a3_0/> to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.:238\u2009\u00a7\u200918 The digits 0\u20139 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 011, making conversion with binary-coded decimal straightforward."}
