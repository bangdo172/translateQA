Kaypro CP/M computers used <a1_0>the \"upper\" 128 characters for the Greek alphabet<a1_0/>. The IBM PC defined <b9_0>code page 437<b9_0/>, which replaced the control-characters with <a2_0><b6_0>graphic symbols such as smiley faces<b6_0/><a2_0/>, and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as DOS supported these code pages, and manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware. Digital Equipment Corporation developed <b8_0>the <a3_0>Multinational Character Set (DEC-MCS)<b8_0/><a3_0/> for use in the popular VT220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and <a4_0><b7_0>typographic punctuation marks<b7_0/><a4_0/> instead of graphics, more like modern character sets."}
