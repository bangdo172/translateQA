Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage <a2_0><b7_0>until the 1980s<b7_0/><a2_0/>, <a3_0><b8_0>less costly and in some ways less fragile<b8_0/><a3_0/> than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 (Delete) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of underscore), a noncompliant use of <a4_0><b9_0>code 15 (Control-O, Shift In)<b9_0/><a4_0/> interpreted as \"delete previous character\" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected."}
