For example, lowercase j would become binary 1101010 and decimal 106. ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: <a2_0>33 are non-printing control characters<a2_0/> (many now obsolete) that affect how text and space are processed and <a3_0><b8_0>95 printable characters<b8_0/><a3_0/>, including the space (which is considered an <a4_0>invisible graphic:223<a4_0/>)."}
