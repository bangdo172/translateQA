By the time so-called \"glass TTYs\" (later called <a0_0><b9_0>CRTs or terminals<b9_0/><a0_0/>) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When Gary Kildall cloned <a1_0><b5_0>RT-11<b5_0/><a1_0/> to create CP/M he followed established DEC convention. Until the introduction of PC DOS in <a2_0><b6_0>1981<b6_0/><a2_0/>, IBM had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used <a3_0><b7_0>EBCDIC<b7_0/><a3_0/> instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. IBM's PC DOS (also marketed as <a4_0>MS-DOS<a4_0/> by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of CP/M, and Windows inherited it from <b8_0>MS-DOS<b8_0/>."}
