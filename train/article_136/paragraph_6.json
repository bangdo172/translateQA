Like other character encodings, ASCII specifies a correspondence between <a1_0><b6_0>digital bit patterns and character symbols<b6_0/><a1_0/> (i.e. graphemes and control characters). This allows digital devices to <a2_0><b7_0>communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information<b7_0/><a2_0/> such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters, 10 numerical digits, and from <a3_0><b8_0>11 to 25 special graphic symbols<b8_0/><a3_0/>. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the Comit\u00e9 Consultatif International T\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et T\u00e9l\u00e9graphique (CCITT) International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) standard, Fieldata, and early EBCDIC, <a4_0><b9_0>more than 64 codes<b9_0/><a4_0/> were required for ASCII."}
