This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a \"<a2_0><b6_0>handshaking<b6_0/><a2_0/>\" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by <b8_0>a second Control-S<b8_0/> to resume output. The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ <a3_0><b7_0>Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4)<b7_0/><a3_0/> to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and TAPE respectively."}
