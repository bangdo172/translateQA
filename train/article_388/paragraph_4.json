The architect <a1_0>James Gibbs<a1_0/> was a transitional figure, his earlier buildings are Baroque, reflecting the time he spent in Rome in the early 18th century, but he adjusted his style after 1720. Major architects to promote the change in direction from baroque were Colen Campbell, author of the influential book <a2_0><b8_0>Vitruvius Britannicus<b8_0/><a2_0/> (1715-1725); Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 William Kent; Isaac Ware; Henry Flitcroft and the <b6_0>Venetian <a4_0>Giacomo<b6_0/> Leoni<a4_0/>, who spent most of his career in <b9_0>England<b9_0/>. Other prominent architects of the early Georgian period include James Paine, Robert Taylor, and John Wood, the Elder. <a3_0><b7_0>The European Grand Tour<b7_0/><a3_0/> became very common for wealthy patrons in the period, and Italian influence remained dominant, though at the start of the period Hanover Square, Westminster (1713 on), developed and occupied by Whig supporters of the new dynasty, seems to have deliberately adopted German stylisic elements in their honour, especially vertical bands connecting the windows."}
