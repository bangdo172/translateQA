Houses were increasingly placed in grand landscaped settings, and large houses were generally <a1_0><b6_0>made wide and relatively shallow<b6_0/><a1_0/>, largely to look more impressive from a distance. The height was usually highest in <a2_0><b7_0>the centre<b7_0/><a2_0/>, and the Baroque emphasis on corner pavilions often found on the continent generally avoided. In grand houses, <b8_0>an entrance hall<b8_0/> led to steps up to a piano nobile or <a4_0>mezzanine floor<a4_0/> where the main reception rooms were. Typically <b9_0>the <a3_0>basement area<a3_0/> or \"rustic\"<b9_0/>, with kitchens, offices and service areas, as well as male guests with muddy boots, came some way above ground, and was lit by windows that were high on the inside, but just above ground level outside. A single block was typical, with a perhaps a small court for carriages at the front marked off by railings and a gate, but rarely a stone gatehouse, or side wings around the court."}
