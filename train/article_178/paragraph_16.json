Closest relative is the mutual intelligible daughter language <a1_0>Afrikaans<a1_0/>. Other West Germanic languages related to Dutch are German, English and the <a2_0>Frisian<a2_0/> languages, and the non standardised languages <a3_0>Low German<a3_0/> and Yiddish. Dutch stands out in combining a small degree of Ingvaeonic characteristics (occurring consistently in English and Frisian and reduced in intensity from 'west to east' over the continental West Germanic plane) with mostly Istvaeonic characteristics, of which some of them are also incorporated in German. Unlike <a4_0>German<a4_0/>, Dutch (apart from Limburgish) has not been influenced at all by the 'south to north' movement of the High German sound shift, and had some changes of its own. The cumulation of these changes resulted over time in separate, but related standard languages with various degrees of similarities and differences between them.
