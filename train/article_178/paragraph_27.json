Dutch is taught in various educational centres in Indonesia, the most important of which is the <a2_0>Erasmus Language Centre<a2_0/> (ETC) in Jakarta. Each year, some 1,500 to 2,000 students take Dutch courses there. In total, several thousand Indonesians study Dutch as a foreign language. Owing to centuries of Dutch rule in Indonesia, many old documents are written in Dutch.
