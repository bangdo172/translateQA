Dutch is together with English and German part of the <a2_0>West Germanic<a2_0/> group, that is characterized by a number of phonological and morphological innovations not found in North and East Germanic. The West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups: <a3_0>Ingvaeonic<a3_0/> (North Sea Germanic), Istvaeonic (Weser-Rhine Germanic) and Irminonic (Elbe Germanic). It appears that the Frankish tribes fit primarily into the <a4_0>Istvaeonic<a4_0/> dialect group with certain Ingvaeonic influences towards the northwest, still seen in modern Dutch."}
