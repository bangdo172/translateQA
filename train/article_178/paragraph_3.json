In Middle Dutch, which was a collection of dialects, dietsc was used in Flanders and Brabant, while diets or duutsc was in use in the Northern Netherlands. It derived from the Old Germanic word <a0_0>theudisk<a0_0/>, one of the first names ever used for the non-Romance languages of Western Europe, meaning (pertaining to the language) of the people, that is, the native Germanic language. The term was used as opposed to <a1_0>Latin<a1_0/>, the non-native language of writing and the Catholic Church. In the first text in which it is found, dating from <a2_0>784<a2_0/>, it refers to the Germanic dialects of Britain. In the Oaths of Strasbourg (<a3_0>842<a3_0/>) it appeared as <a4_0>teudisca<a4_0/> to refer to the Germanic (Rhenish Franconian) portion of the oath."}
