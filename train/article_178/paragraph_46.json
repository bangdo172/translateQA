A few nouns exist solely in a diminutive form, e.g. <a1_0>zeepaardje<a1_0/> (seahorse), while many, e.g. meisje (girl), originally a diminutive of <a2_0>meid<a2_0/> (maid), have acquired a meaning independent of their non-diminutive forms. A diminutive can sometimes be added to an uncountable noun to refer to <a4_0>a single portion<a4_0/>: ijs (ice, ice cream) \u2192 ijsje (ice cream treat, cone of ice cream), bier (beer) \u2192 biertje. Some diminutive forms only exist in plural, e.g. <a3_0>kleertjes<a3_0/> (clothing)."}
