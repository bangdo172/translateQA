High German and Low German, influential until the mid of the 19th century, account for <a3_0>2.7%<a3_0/>, but are mostly unrecognizable since many German loanwords have been \"Dutchified\", e.g. German \"Fremdling\" become Dutch \"vreemdeling\". From English, Dutch has taken over words since the middle of the 19th century, as a consequence of the gaining power of Britain and the United States. The share of English loanwords is about 1.5%, but this number is still on the increase. Conversely, <a4_0>Dutch<a4_0/> contributed many loanwords to English, accounting for 1.3%."}
