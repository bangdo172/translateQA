One feature or the other may be considered redundant, and some phonemic analyses prefer to treat it as an opposition of tenseness. However, even if not considered part of the phonemic opposition, the long/tense vowels are still realised as phonetically longer than their short counterparts. The changes in vowel quality are also not always the same in all dialects, and in some there may be little difference at all, with <a3_0>length<a3_0/> remaining the primary distinguishing feature. And while it is <a1_0>true<a1_0/> that older words always pair vowel length with a change in vowel quality, new loanwords have reintroduced phonemic oppositions of length.
