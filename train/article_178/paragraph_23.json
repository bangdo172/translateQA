Dutch is a monocentric language, with all speakers using the same standard form (authorized by the <a3_0>Dutch Language Union<a3_0/>) based on a Dutch orthography employing the Latin alphabet when writing. In stark contrast to its written uniformity, Dutch lacks a prestige dialect and has a large dialectal continuum consisting of <a4_0>28<a4_0/> main dialects, which can themselves be further divided into at least 600 distinguishable varieties."}
