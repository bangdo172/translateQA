Yet the Indonesian language inherited many words from Dutch: words for everyday life as well as scientific and technological terms. One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian words can be traced back to Dutch words, many of which are transliterated to reflect phonetic pronunciation e.g. kantoor (Dutch for \"office\") in Indonesian is <a1_0>kantor<a1_0/>, while bus (\"bus\") becomes bis. In addition, many Indonesian words are <a2_0>calques<a2_0/> on Dutch, for example, rumah sakit (Indonesian for \"hospital\") is calqued on the Dutch <a3_0>ziekenhuis<a3_0/> (literally \"house of the sick\"), <a4_0>kebun binatang<a4_0/> (\"zoo\") on dierentuin (literally \"animal garden\"), undang-undang dasar (\"constitution\") from grondwet (literally \"ground law\"). These account for some of the differences in vocabulary between Indonesian and Malay."}
