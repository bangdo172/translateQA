This let inevitably to confusion since similar terms referred to different languages. Therefore, in the <a0_0>16th<a0_0/> century, a differentiation took place. Owing to Dutch commercial and colonial rivalry in the 16th and 17th centuries, the English term came to refer exclusively to the Dutch. A notable exception is <a1_0>Pennsylvania Dutch<a1_0/>, which is a West Central German variety called <a2_0>Deitsch<a2_0/> by its speakers. Jersey Dutch, on the other hand, as spoken until the <a3_0>1950s<a3_0/> in New Jersey, is a Dutch-based creole."}
