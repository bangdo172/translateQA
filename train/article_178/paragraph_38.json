This is the most common diphthong along with /\u025bi \u0153y/. All <a1_0>three<a1_0/> are commonly the only ones considered unique phonemes in Dutch. The tendency for native English speakers is to pronounce Dutch names with /\u025bi/ (written as ij or ei) as /a\u026a/, (like the English vowel <a0_0>y<a0_0/>) which does not normally lead to confusion among native listeners, since in a number of dialects (e.g. in Amsterdam) the same pronunciation is heard."}
