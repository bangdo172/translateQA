For example, an oddity of West Flemings (and to a lesser extent, East Flemings) is that, the voiced velar fricative (written as \"g\" in Dutch) shifts to a voiced glottal fricative (written as <a1_0>\"h\"<a1_0/> in Dutch), while the letter \"h\" in West Flemish becomes mute (just like in <a2_0>French<a2_0/>). As a result, when West Flemish try to talk Standard Dutch, they're often unable to pronounce the g-sound, and pronounce it similar to the h-sound. This leaves f.e. no difference between \"<a3_0>held<a3_0/>\" (hero) and \"<a0_0>geld<a0_0/>\" (money). Or in some cases, they are aware of the problem, and hyper-correct the \"h\" into a voiced velar fricative or <a4_0>g-sound<a4_0/>, again leaving no difference."}
