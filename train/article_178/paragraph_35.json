Like English, Dutch did not participate in <a1_0>the second consonant shift<a1_0/>. Like most Germanic languages, the Dutch consonant system did not undergo the High German consonant shift and has a syllable structure that allows fairly complex consonant clusters. Dutch also retains full use of the <a0_0>velar fricatives<a0_0/> that were present in Proto-Germanic, but lost or modified in many other Germanic languages. Dutch has final-obstruent devoicing: at the end of a word, voicing distinction is neutralised and all obstruents are pronounced <a2_0>voiceless<a2_0/>. For example, <a3_0>goede<a3_0/> (\"good\") is /\u02c8\u0263ud\u0259/ but the related form goed is /\u0263ut/. Dutch shares with <a4_0>German<a4_0/> Final-obstruent devoicing (Du brood [bro\u02d0t] and German Brot vs Eng bread)."}
