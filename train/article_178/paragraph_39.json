The lowering of the diphthongs has long been current in many Dutch dialects, and is comparable to the <a0_0>English Great Vowel Shift<a0_0/>, and the diphthongisation of long high vowels in Modern High German, which centuries earlier reached the state now found in Polder Dutch. <a3_0>Stroop<a3_0/> theorizes that the lowering of open-mid to open diphthongs is a phonetically \"natural\" and inevitable development and that Dutch, after having diphthongised the long high vowels like German and <a4_0>English<a4_0/>, \"should\" have lowered the diphthongs like German and English as well."}
