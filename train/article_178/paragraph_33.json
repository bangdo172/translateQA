Afrikaans is grammatically far <a1_0>less complex<a1_0/> than Dutch, and vocabulary items are generally altered in a clearly patterned manner, e.g. <a2_0>vogel<a2_0/> becomes vo\u00ebl (\"bird\") and regen becomes <a3_0>re\u00ebn<a3_0/> (\"rain\"). In South Africa, the number of students following Dutch at university, is <a4_0>difficult<a4_0/> to estimate, since the academic study of Afrikaans inevitably includes the study of Dutch. Elsewhere in the world, the number of people learning Dutch is relatively small."}
