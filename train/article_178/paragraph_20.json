Often simple suffix shifts (like switching between -the, -ske, -ke, -je, ...), sometimes the suffixes even depend on quite specific grammar rules for a certain dialect. Again taking West Flemish as an example. In that language, the words \"<a1_0>ja<a1_0/>\" (yes) and \"<a0_0>nee<a0_0/>\" (no) are also conjugated to the (often implicit) <a2_0>subject<a2_0/> of the sentence. These separate grammar rules are a lot more difficult to imitate correctly than simple <a4_0>sound shifts<a4_0/>, making it <a3_0>easy<a3_0/> to recognise people who didn't grow up in a certain region, even decades after they moved."}
