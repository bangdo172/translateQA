The dialects of <a1_0>Flanders and Brabant<a1_0/> were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the <a2_0>16th<a2_0/> century, mainly based on the urban dialect of Antwerp. In <a3_0>1585<a3_0/> Antwerp fell to the Spanish army: many fled to the Northern Netherlands, where the Dutch Republic declared its independence from Spain. They particularly influenced the urban dialects of the province of Holland. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language, when the <a4_0>Statenvertaling<a4_0/>, the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the new republic could understand. It used elements from various, even Dutch Low Saxon, dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland of post 16th century."}
