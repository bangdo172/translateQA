Most notable however, are the diminutive forms of adjectives and adverbs. The former take an diminutive ending and thus functions as a <a1_0>noun<a1_0/>, the latter remain adverbs and have always the diminutive with the -s appended, e.g. adjective: <a3_0>groen<a3_0/> (\"green\") \u2192 noun: groentje (\"<a4_0>rookie<a4_0/>\"); adverb: even (\"just\") \u2192 <a2_0>adverb<a2_0/>: eventjes (\"just a minute\")."}
