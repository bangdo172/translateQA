There is one exception: the standard language prescribes that in the third person plural, <a1_0>hen<a1_0/> is to be used for the direct object, and hun for the indirect object. This distinction was artificially introduced in the <a2_0>17th century<a2_0/> by grammarians, and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers. Consequently, the third person plural forms hun and hen are interchangeable in normal usage, with <a3_0>hun<a3_0/> being more common. The shared unstressed form <a4_0>ze<a4_0/> is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people are unsure which form to use."}
