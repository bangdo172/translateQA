Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren (\"they recommended me to him\"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a \u00e9l. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the <a1_0>passive voice<a1_0/> (as in <a2_0>French or English<a2_0/>), or identifying the direct object with a <a3_0>preposition<a3_0/> (as in Spanish)."}
