In this way, for instance, IEC says it is correct writing cantam as much as cantem ('we sing') but the University says that the priority form in the Balearic Islands must be \"cantam\" in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the <a2_0>non-ending<a2_0/> in the 1st person singular present indicative: jo compr ('I buy'), jo tem ('I fear'), jo dorm ('I sleep')."}
