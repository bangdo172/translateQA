However, this division is mostly theoretical. Only the <a1_0>first conjugation<a1_0/> is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), whereas the third (the subtype of servir, with about <a2_0>700<a2_0/> common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the <a3_0>second<a3_0/> conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding."}
