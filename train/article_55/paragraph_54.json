Nevertheless, AVL's standard keeps the grave accent \u27e8\u00e8\u27e9, without pronouncing this \u27e8e\u27e9 as /\u025b/, in some words like: qu\u00e8 ('what'), or Val\u00e8ncia. Other divergences include the use of \u27e8tl\u27e9 (AVL) in some words instead of \u27e8tll\u27e9 like in ametla/ametlla ('almond'), espatla/espatlla ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives (este 'this', eixe 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones (aquest, aqueix) or the use of <a1_0>many <a2_0>verbal forms<a2_0/><a1_0/> common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western Catalan too, like subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -ix- at the same level as -eix- or the priority use of -e morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-ar verbs): <a0_0>jo compre<a0_0/> instead of jo compro ('I buy')."}
