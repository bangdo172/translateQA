There was the equivalent of a bank run on the <a1_0>money market funds<a1_0/>, which frequently invest in <a2_0>commercial paper issued by corporations<a2_0/> to fund their operations and payrolls. Withdrawal from money markets were <a3_0>$144.5 billion<a3_0/> during one week, versus $7.1 billion the week prior. This interrupted the ability of corporations to rollover (replace) their short-term debt. The U.S. government responded by extending insurance for money market accounts analogous to bank deposit insurance via a temporary guarantee and with Federal Reserve programs to purchase commercial paper. The TED spread, an indicator of perceived credit risk in the general economy, spiked up in July 2007, remained volatile for a year, then spiked even higher in September 2008, reaching a record <a4_0>4.65%<a4_0/> on October 10, 2008."}
