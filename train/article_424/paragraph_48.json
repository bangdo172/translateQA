A number of heterodox economists predicted the crisis, with varying arguments. <a2_0>Dirk Bezemer<a2_0/> in his research credits (with supporting argument and estimates of timing) 12 economists with predicting the crisis: Dean Baker (US), Wynne Godley (UK), Fred Harrison (UK), Michael Hudson (US), Eric Janszen (US), Steve Keen (Australia), Jakob Br\u00f8chner Madsen & Jens Kjaer S\u00f8rensen (Denmark), Kurt Richeb\u00e4cher (US), Nouriel Roubini (US), Peter Schiff (US), and Robert Shiller (US). Examples of other experts who gave indications of a financial crisis have also been given. Not surprisingly, the Austrian economic school regarded the crisis <a3_0>as a vindication<a3_0/> and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble that could not forestall the disregarded but inevitable effect of an artificial, manufactured laxity in monetary supply, a perspective that even former Fed Chair <a4_0>Alan Greenspan<a4_0/> in Congressional testimony confessed himself forced to return to."}
