Calls by Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman Vince Cable to nationalise the institution were initially ignored; in <a3_0>February 2008<a3_0/>, however, the British government (having failed to find a private sector buyer) relented, and the bank was taken into public hands. <a4_0>Northern Rock<a4_0/>'s problems proved to be an early indication of the troubles that would soon befall other banks and financial institutions."}
