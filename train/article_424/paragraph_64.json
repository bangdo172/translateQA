Businesses are facing the worst downturn since the Great Depression. This matters for credit decisions. A homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt. They will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and/or have a default placed on their credit record. On the other hand, a homeowner who has no equity is a <a0_0>serious<a0_0/> default risk. In the case of businesses, their creditworthiness depends on their <a3_0>future profits<a3_0/>. Profit prospects look <a4_0>much worse<a4_0/> in November 2008 than they did in November 2007... While many banks are obviously at the brink, consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid. The problem with the economy is the <a1_0>loss of close to $6 trillion in housing wealth<a1_0/> and an even larger amount of stock wealth."}
