IndyMac concluded that these downgrades would have negatively impacted the Company's risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008.

IndyMac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below \"well capitalized\" (<a4_0>minimum 10% risk-based<a4_0/> capital ratio) to \"adequately capitalized\" (8\u201310% risk-based capital ratio) the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds."}
