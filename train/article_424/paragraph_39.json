There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order <a2_0>to maximize their compensation<a2_0/>. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers chose to <a3_0>continue to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments<a3_0/>, to the detriment of their clients, in order to maintain their assets under management. This choice was supported by a \"<a4_0>plausible deniability<a4_0/>\" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early \"vintages\" of subprime loans was so low."}
