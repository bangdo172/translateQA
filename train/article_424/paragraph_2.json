The U.S. Senate's <a0_0>Levin\u2013Coburn Report<a0_0/> concluded that the crisis was the result of \"high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts of interest; the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street.\" The <a2_0>Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission<a2_0/> concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by \"widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision\", \"dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions\", \"a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency\" by financial institutions, ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that \"added to the uncertainty and panic\", a \"systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics\", \"collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline\", deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives, especially credit default swaps, and \"the failures of credit rating agencies\" to correctly price risk. The 1999 repeal of the <a1_0>Glass-Steagall Act<a1_0/> effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States. Critics argued that <a3_0>credit rating agencies<a3_0/> and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products, and that governments did not adjust their <a4_0>regulatory<a4_0/> practices to address 21st-century financial markets. Research into the causes of the financial crisis has also focused on the role of interest rate spreads."}
