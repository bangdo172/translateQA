A bridge bank, <a1_0>IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB<a1_0/>, was established to assume control of IndyMac Bank's assets, its secured liabilities, and its insured deposit accounts. The FDIC announced plans to open IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB on <a2_0>July 14, 2008<a2_0/>. Until then, depositors would have access their insured deposits through ATMs, their existing checks, and their existing debit cards. Telephone and Internet account access was restored when the bank reopened. The FDIC guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to <a3_0>US$100,000<a3_0/>, and has declared a special advance dividend to the <a4_0>roughly 10,000 depositors<a4_0/> with funds in excess of the insured amount, guaranteeing 50% of any amounts in excess of $100,000. Yet, even with the pending sale of Indymac to IMB Management Holdings, an estimated 10,000 uninsured depositors of Indymac are still at a loss of over $270 million."}
