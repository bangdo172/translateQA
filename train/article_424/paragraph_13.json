They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in <a0_0>1995<a0_0/> and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve <a4_0>after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001<a4_0/>. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place. Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling <a1_0>$4.5 trillion<a1_0/> in the years between 1994 and 2007. They also argue that the Federal Reserve\u2019s classification of CRA loans as \u201c<a3_0>prime<a3_0/>\u201d is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that <a2_0>high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average)<a2_0/> equal \u201csubprime\u201d loans."}
