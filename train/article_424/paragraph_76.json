It increased <a3_0>capital ratios<a3_0/>, limits on leverage, narrow definition of capital (to exclude subordinated debt), limit counter-party risk, and new liquidity requirements. Critics argue that Basel III doesn\u2019t address the problem of <a1_0>faulty risk-weightings<a1_0/>. Major banks suffered losses from AAA-rated created by <a4_0>financial engineering<a4_0/> (which creates apparently risk-free assets out of high risk collateral) that required less capital according to Basel II. Lending to AA-rated sovereigns has a risk-weight of zero, thus increasing lending to governments and leading to the next crisis. <a2_0>Johan Norberg<a2_0/> argues that regulations (Basel III among others) have indeed led to excessive lending to risky governments (see European sovereign-debt crisis) and the ECB pursues even more lending as the solution."}
