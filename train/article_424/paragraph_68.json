With generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits, such as remittances, <a1_0>Foreign Direct Investment<a1_0/> (FDI) or foreign aid, Arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008. This group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks. They entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions. This gives them a significant cushion against the <a2_0>global downturn<a2_0/>. The greatest impact of the global economic crisis will come in the form of <a3_0>lower oil prices<a3_0/>, which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance. Steadily declining <a4_0>oil prices<a4_0/> would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments. Significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks. Initial impact will be seen on public finances and employment for foreign workers."}
