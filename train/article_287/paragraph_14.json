Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been, which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of <b5_0>anticipating <a1_0>a potential possibility, task, or engagement<b5_0/><a1_0/>. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes \"being ahead of oneself\" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. <a2_0><b10_0>The present<b10_0/><a2_0/> becomes an experience, which is <b6_0>qualitative<b6_0/> instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that <b7_0>a linear relationship with time<b7_0/>, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. We are not stuck in sequential time. We are able to remember <b13_0>the past<b13_0/> and project into the future\u2014we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, <a3_0><b8_0><b11_0>step out of (ecstasis) sequential time<b11_0/><b8_0/>."}
