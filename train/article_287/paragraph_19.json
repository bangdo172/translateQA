Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced <a1_0><b10_0>for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light<b10_0/>.<a1_0/> <b13_0>Many subatomic particles<b13_0/> exist for only <a2_0><b11_0>a fixed fraction of a second<b11_0/><a2_0/> in a lab relatively at rest, but some that travel close to the speed of light can be measured to travel farther and survive much longer than expected (<b4_0>a muon<b4_0/> is one example). According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is <b7_0>zero<b7_0/>. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, <b5_0>time<b5_0/> seems to \"slow down\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, <b8_0>distances<b8_0/> seem to shorten. Einstein showed how <a3_0><b12_0>both temporal and spatial dimensions<b12_0/><a3_0/> can be altered (or \"warped\") by <b6_0>high-speed motion<b6_0/>."}
