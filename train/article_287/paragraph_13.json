With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather <a1_0><b11_0>both are elements of <b7_0>a systematic mental framework<b11_0/><b7_0/><a1_0/> that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject.

In this view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that \"flows,\" that objects \"move through,\" or that is a \"container\" for events. <a4_0><b14_0>Spatial measurements<b14_0/><a4_0/> are used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and <a3_0><b13_0>temporal measurements<b13_0/><a3_0/> are used to quantify the durations of and between events.
