In this formalism, distances in space can be measured <a1_0><b6_0><b11_0>by how long light takes to travel<b6_0/> that distance<b11_0/><a1_0/>, e.g., a light-year is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two events in Minkowski spacetime are separated <a2_0><b7_0>by <b12_0>an invariant interval<b12_0/><b7_0/><a2_0/>, which can be either <a4_0><b8_0>space-like, light-like, or time-like<b8_0/><a4_0/>. Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any frame of reference, there must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation. Events that have a space-like separation will be <b9_0>simultaneous<b9_0/> in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate <b14_0>different distances and different time intervals between two events<b14_0/>, but the invariant interval between the events is independent <a3_0><b13_0>of the observer (and his velocity)<b13_0/><a3_0/>."}
