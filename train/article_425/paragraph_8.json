The Arabs were principally <a1_0>noblemen from Oman<a1_0/>; and though few in numbers, they constituted the elite of the population. The Berbers were originally from the <a2_0>Atlas mountains and Rif mountains of North Africa<a2_0/> and were essentially nomads. In Portugal, the Muslim population (or \"Moors\"), relatively small in numbers, stayed in the <a3_0>Algarve region, and south of the Tagus<a3_0/>. Today, there are approximately <a4_0>800<a4_0/> words in the Portuguese language of Arabic origin. The Muslims were expelled from Portugal 300 years earlier than in neighbouring Spain, which is reflected both in Portuguese culture and the language, which is mostly Celtiberian and Vulgar Latin."}
