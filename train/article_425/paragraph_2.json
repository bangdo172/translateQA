After the <a2_0>1910<a2_0/> revolution deposed the monarchy, the democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic was established, later being superseded by the \"Estado Novo\" right-wing authoritarian regime. Democracy was restored after the Portuguese Colonial War and the Carnation Revolution in 1974. Shortly after, independence was granted to all its colonies, with the exception of <a3_0>Macau<a3_0/>, which was handed over to China in 1999.
