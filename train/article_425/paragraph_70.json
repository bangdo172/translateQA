Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been a trend towards the development of a renewable resource industry and reduction of both consumption and use of fossil fuel resources. In 2006, the world's largest solar power plant at that date, the Moura Photovoltaic Power Station, began operating near <a1_0>Moura, in the south<a1_0/>, while the world's first commercial wave power farm, the Agu\u00e7adoura Wave Farm, opened in the <a2_0>Norte region<a2_0/> (2008). By the end of 2006, 66% of the country's electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants, while <a3_0>29%<a3_0/> were derived from hydroelectric dams, and 6% by wind energy."}
