Thus, survey results based on <a0_0>self-reporting at the household level<a0_0/> complement other data on health status and the use of services. Only <a1_0>one third<a1_0/> of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity."}
