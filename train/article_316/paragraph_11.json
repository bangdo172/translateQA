Multi-storey buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of <b7_0>glass<b7_0/>. Similarly, <a0_0><b5_0>laminated<b5_0/><a0_0/> glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens. While glass containers have always been used for storage and are valued for their hygienic properties, glass has been utilized increasingly in industry. Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the <a1_0><b6_0>late Middle Ages<b6_0/><a1_0/>. The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding <a4_0><b9_0>astronomers<b9_0/><a4_0/> as well as having other application in medicine and science.
