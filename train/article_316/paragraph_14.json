The network formers (<a0_0><b4_0>silicon, boron, germanium<b4_0/><a0_0/>) form a highly cross-linked network of chemical bonds. The <a2_0><b6_0>intermediates<b6_0/><a2_0/> (titanium, aluminium, zirconium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc) can act as both network formers and modifiers, according to the glass composition. The <a1_0><b5_0>modifiers<b5_0/><a1_0/> (calcium, lead, lithium, sodium, potassium) alter the network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one <a3_0><b7_0>covalent bond<b7_0/><a3_0/> to the glass network and holding one <b8_0>negative charge<b8_0/> to compensate for the positive ion nearby. Some elements can play multiple roles; e.g. lead can act both as a network former (Pb4+ replacing Si4+), or as a modifier."}
