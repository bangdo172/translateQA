The term glass is often used to describe any amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition temperature Tg. If the <a2_0><b6_0>cooling<b6_0/><a2_0/> is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then crystallization is prevented and instead <b8_0>the disordered atomic configuration of the supercooled liquid is frozen<b8_0/> into the solid state at Tg. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called <a1_0><b5_0>glass-forming ability<b5_0/><a1_0/>. This ability can be predicted by the <a3_0><b7_0>rigidity theory<b7_0/><a3_0/>. Generally, the structure of a glass exists in a metastable state with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase."}
