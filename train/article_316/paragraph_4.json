It is used in the manufacture of lenses and windows. Common glass has a refraction index around <a1_0><b6_0>1.5<b6_0/><a1_0/>. This may be modified by adding low-density materials such as <a0_0><b5_0>boron<b5_0/><a0_0/>, which lowers the index of refraction (see crown glass), or increased (to as much as 1.8) with high-density materials such as (classically) <a2_0><b7_0>lead oxide<b7_0/><a2_0/> (see flint glass and lead glass), or in modern uses, less toxic oxides of zirconium, titanium, or barium. These high-index glasses (inaccurately known as \"<a3_0><b8_0>crystal<b8_0/><a3_0/>\" when used in glass vessels) cause more chromatic dispersion of light, and are prized <a4_0><b9_0>for their diamond-like optical properties<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
