Soda-lime glass for mass production is melted in gas fired units. Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks. After melting, homogenization and refining (<a0_0><b5_0>removal of bubbles<b5_0/><a0_0/>), the glass is formed. Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the <a1_0><b6_0>float glass process<b6_0/><a1_0/>, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir <a4_0><b9_0>Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff<b9_0/><a4_0/> of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to <a2_0><b7_0>nitrogen<b7_0/><a2_0/> under pressure to obtain a polished finish. Container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods. This glass is often slightly modified chemically (with more <a3_0><b8_0>alumina and calcium oxide<b8_0/><a3_0/>) for greater water resistance. Further glass forming techniques are summarized in the table Glass forming techniques."}
