Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glasses contain both <a2_0><b7_0>alkali and alkaline earth ions<b7_0/><a2_0/> (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be achieved by <a1_0><b6_0>dealkalization<b6_0/><a1_0/>, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. <a3_0><b8_0>sulfur or fluorine compounds<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the <a4_0><b9_0>loss tangent<b9_0/><a4_0/> of the glass, and to its electrical resistance; glasses for electronics (sealing, vacuum tubes, lamps...) have to take this in account."}
