This phase is the first phase, or \"<b8_0>primary phase<b8_0/>,\" to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling. Interestingly, experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a first-order transition. <a3_0><b7_0>Transmission electron<b7_0/><a3_0/> microscopy (TEM) images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles, which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions. The diffraction pattern shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase. Yet there is a <a1_0><b5_0>nucleation barrier<b5_0/><a1_0/>, which implies an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and the melt."}
