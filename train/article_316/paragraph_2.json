It has <a3_0><b8_0>excellent thermal shock characteristics<b8_0/><a3_0/>, being able to survive immersion in water while red hot. However, its <a4_0><b9_0>high melting-temperature<b9_0/><a4_0/> (1723 \u00b0C) and viscosity make it difficult to work with. Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, \"<b5_0>soda<b5_0/>\"), which lowers the glass transition temperature. The <a0_0>soda<a0_0/> makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (calcium oxide [CaO], generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a <a1_0><b6_0>better chemical durability<b6_0/><a1_0/>. The resulting glass contains about <a2_0><b7_0>70 to 74<b7_0/><a2_0/>% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass. Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass."}
