The raw materials for laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because <a2_0><b7_0>the cost factor has a low priority<b7_0/><a2_0/>. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e.g., <a0_0><b5_0>sodium selenite<b5_0/><a0_0/> may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in <a1_0><b6_0>platinum crucibles<b6_0/><a1_0/> to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass <a3_0><b8_0>homogeneity<b8_0/><a3_0/> is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed <a4_0><b9_0>to prevent breakage<b9_0/><a4_0/> during processing."}
