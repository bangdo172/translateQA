The most commercially important of these have the distinction of being <a2_0><b7_0>impervious to thermal shock<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for <a1_0><b6_0>countertop cooking<b6_0/><a1_0/>. The negative thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase. At a certain point (<a4_0><b9_0>~70%<b9_0/><a4_0/> crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero. This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to <a0_0><b5_0>1000 \u00b0C<b5_0/><a0_0/>."}
