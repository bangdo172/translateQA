Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and <a3_0><b8_0>optical fibers<b8_0/><a3_0/> for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be colored by adding <a0_0><b5_0>metallic salts<a0_0/>,<b5_0/> and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or molded into any shape, and also because it is a sterile product, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a <a4_0><b9_0>thermal insulating material<b9_0/><a4_0/>, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an <a1_0><b6_0>organic polymer plastic<b6_0/><a1_0/>, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and reading glasses."}
