In contrast, <a2_0><b6_0>polycrystalline materials<b6_0/><a2_0/> do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the <a0_0><b4_0><b8_0>internal subdivisions<b8_0/><b4_0/><a0_0/> associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow <a1_0><b5_0>surface tension<b5_0/><a1_0/>, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing\u2014i.e., <a3_0><b7_0>colored<b7_0/><a3_0/>."}
