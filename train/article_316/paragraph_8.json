Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although <a0_0>iron(II) oxide<a0_0/> (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and Cr2O3 additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form <a3_0><b8_0>iron polysulfides<b8_0/><a3_0/> and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a <a2_0><b7_0>reducing combustion atmosphere<b7_0/><a2_0/>. <a1_0><b6_0>Manganese dioxide<b6_0/><a1_0/> can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by <b5_0>iron(II) oxide<b5_0/>. When used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and 'cook' times. Most colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who serve this market although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make their own color from raw materials."}
