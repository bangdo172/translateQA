This assumption is incorrect, as <a4_0><b9_0>once solidified<b9_0/><a4_0/>, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation is that in the past, when panes of glass were commonly made by <a1_0><b6_0>glassblowers<b6_0/><a1_0/>, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the <a2_0><b7_0>crown glass process<b7_0/><a2_0/>, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of <a0_0><b5_0>stability<b5_0/><a0_0/> and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames at the bottom of the window. Occasionally such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right."}
