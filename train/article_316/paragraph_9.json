Indigenous development of glass technology in South Asia may have begun in <a2_0><b7_0>1730 BCE<b7_0/><a2_0/>. In ancient <a1_0><b6_0><b9_0>China<b9_0/><b6_0/><a1_0/>, though, glassmaking seems to have a late start, compared to ceramics and metal work. The term glass developed in the late Roman Empire. It was in the Roman glassmaking center at <a3_0><b8_0>Trier<b8_0/><a3_0/>, now in modern <a4_0>Germany<a4_0/>, that the late-Latin term <a0_0><b5_0>glesum<b5_0/><a0_0/> originated, probably from a Germanic word for a transparent, lustrous substance. Glass objects have been recovered across the Roman empire in domestic, industrial and funerary contexts.[citation needed]"}
