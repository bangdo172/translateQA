Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was also used in jewelry. From the <a1_0><b6_0>10th-century<b6_0/><a1_0/> onwards, glass was employed in stained glass windows of churches and cathedrals, with famous examples at Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint Denis. By the 14th-century, architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as <a3_0><b8_0>Sainte-Chapelle<b8_0/><a3_0/>, Paris, (1203\u20131248) and the East end of Gloucester Cathedral. Stained glass had a major revival with Gothic Revival architecture in the <a0_0><b5_0>19th-century<b5_0/><a0_0/>. With <a2_0><b7_0>the Renaissance<b7_0/><a2_0/>, and a change in architectural style, the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent. The use of domestic stained glass increased until most substantial houses had glass windows. These were initially small panes leaded together, but with the changes in technology, glass could be manufactured relatively cheaply in increasingly larger sheets. This led to larger window panes, and, in the 20th-century, to much <a4_0><b9_0>larger windows<b9_0/><a4_0/> in ordinary domestic and commercial buildings."}
