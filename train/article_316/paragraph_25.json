The change in heat capacity at a glass transition and a melting transition of comparable materials are typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active degrees of freedom is comparable as well. Both in a glass and in a crystal it is mostly only the vibrational degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas <a3_0><b7_0>rotational and translational<b7_0/><a3_0/> motion is arrested. This helps to explain why both crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental time scales."}
