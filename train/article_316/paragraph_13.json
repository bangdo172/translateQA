Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of <a3_0><b7_0>other metal oxides<b7_0/><a3_0/> and is used in colored glasses. The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly <a1_0><b5_0>100 times<b5_0/><a1_0/> in comparison with soda glasses); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders. The <b8_0>high ionic radius<b8_0/> of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have <a2_0><b6_0>high electrical resistance<b6_0/><a2_0/>, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (108.5 vs 106.5 Ohm\u00b7cm, DC at 250 \u00b0C).
