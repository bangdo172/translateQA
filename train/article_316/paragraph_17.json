This was initially termed \"splat cooling\" by doctoral student <a0_0><b5_0>W. Klement<b5_0/><a0_0/> at <a4_0><b9_0>Caltech<b9_0/><a4_0/>, who showed that cooling rates on the order of millions of degrees per second is sufficient to impede the formation of crystals, and the metallic atoms become \"locked into\" a glassy state. Amorphous metal wires have been produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk. More recently a number of alloys have been produced in layers with thickness exceeding 1 millimeter. These are known as <a1_0><b6_0>bulk metallic glasses<b6_0/><a1_0/> (BMG). Liquidmetal Technologies sell a number of <a2_0><b7_0>zirconium<b7_0/><a2_0/>-based BMGs. Batches of <a3_0><b8_0>amorphous steel<b8_0/><a3_0/> have also been produced that demonstrate mechanical properties far exceeding those found in conventional steel alloys."}
