Static testing is often <b8_0>implicit<b8_0/>, as proofreading, plus when programming tools/text editors check source code structure or compilers (pre-compilers) check syntax and data flow as static program analysis. Dynamic testing takes place <b7_0>when the program itself is run<b7_0/>. Dynamic testing may begin <a2_0>before the program is 100% complete<a2_0/> in order to test particular sections of code and are applied to discrete functions or modules. Typical techniques for this are either using <a3_0>stubs/drivers or execution from a debugger environment<a3_0/>."}
