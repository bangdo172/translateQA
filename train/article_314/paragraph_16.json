The data being passed can be considered as \"<a1_0><b5_0>message packets<b5_0/><a1_0/>\" and the range or data types can be checked, for data generated from one unit, and tested for validity before being passed into another unit. One option for interface testing is to <a2_0>keep a <b6_0>separate log file of data items being passed<a2_0/>, often with a timestamp logged to allow analysis of thousands of cases of data passed<b6_0/> between units for days or weeks. Tests can include checking the handling of some extreme data values while other interface variables are passed as normal values. Unusual data values in an interface can help explain <b7_0>unexpected performance in the next unit<b7_0/>. <a3_0><b8_0>Component interface testing<b8_0/><a3_0/> is a variation of black-box testing, with the focus on the data values beyond just the related actions of a subsystem component."}
