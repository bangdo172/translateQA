In white-box <a2_0>testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as <b4_0>programming skills<b4_0/><a2_0/>, are used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs <b5_0>to exercise paths through the code and determine the appropriate outputs.<b5_0/> This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (<b6_0>ICT<b6_0/>)."}
