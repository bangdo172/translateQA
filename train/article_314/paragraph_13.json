The tester can observe the state of the product being tested after performing certain actions such as executing <a1_0><b5_0>SQL statements<b5_0/><a1_0/> against the database and then executing queries to ensure that the expected changes have been reflected. Grey-box testing implements <a2_0><b6_0>intelligent test scenarios<b6_0/><a2_0/>, based on limited information. This will particularly apply to data type handling, exception handling, and so on."}
