For example, in the case of <a3_0>a <a1_0>lack of backward compatibility<a3_0/><a1_0/>, this can occur because the programmers develop and <a4_0>test software only on the latest version of <b6_0>the target<b6_0/> environment<a4_0/>, which not all users may be running. This results in the unintended consequence that the latest work may not function on earlier versions of the target environment, or on older hardware that earlier versions of the target environment was capable of using. Sometimes such issues can be fixed by proactively abstracting operating system functionality into a separate program module or library."}
