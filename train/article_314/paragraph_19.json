Specifically, it seeks to uncover software regressions, <b6_0>as degraded or lost features<b6_0/>, including old bugs that have come back. Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly, <a1_0>stops working as intended<a1_0/>. Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of <b7_0>program changes<b7_0/>, when the newly developed part of the software collides with the previously existing code. Common methods of regression testing include <a2_0><b8_0>re-running previous sets of test-cases<a2_0/> and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged<b8_0/>. The depth of testing depends on the <a3_0>phase in the release process and the risk of the added features<a3_0/>. They can either be complete, for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky, or be very shallow, consisting of positive tests on each feature, if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk. <b9_0>Regression testing<b9_0/> is <a4_0>typically the largest test effort in commercial software development<a4_0/>, due to checking numerous details in prior software features, and even new software can be developed while using some old test-cases to test parts of the new design to ensure prior functionality is still supported."}
