It is performed by the <b6_0>software developer or engineer<b6_0/> during the <a1_0><b4_0>construction phase of the software development lifecycle<b4_0/><a1_0/>. Rather than replace traditional QA focuses, it augments it. Development Testing aims to eliminate <a2_0>construction errors<a2_0/> before code is promoted to <b5_0>QA<b5_0/>; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process."}
