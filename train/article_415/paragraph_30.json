Many of these constitutional debates relate to the competing interpretive theories of originalism versus modern, <a3_0><b8_0>progressivist<b8_0/><a3_0/> theories such as the doctrine of the Living Constitution. Other debates center on the principle of the law of the land in America being defined not just by the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, but also by <a4_0><b9_0>legal precedence<b9_0/><a4_0/>, making an accurate reading of the Constitution subject to the mores and values of a given era, and rendering the concept of historical revisionism irrelevant when discussing the Constitution."}
