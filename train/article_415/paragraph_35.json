Further, the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by <a2_0><b7_0>most Protestants (and most Jews)<b7_0/><a2_0/>, who opposed aid to religious schools, which were mostly Catholic at the time. After 1980, however, <a3_0><b8_0>anti-Catholic sentiment<b8_0/><a3_0/> has diminished among mainline Protestants, and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed. While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state, much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position. As a consequence, <a4_0><b9_0>strict separationism<b9_0/><a4_0/> is opposed today by members of many Protestant faiths, even perhaps eclipsing the opposition of Roman Catholics.[citation needed]"}
