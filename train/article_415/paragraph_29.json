Some of the intermingling between church and state include religious references in official contexts, and such other founding documents as the United States Declaration of Independence, which references the idea of a \"Creator\" and \"Nature's God\", though these references did not ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any particular religious view of a \"Creator\" or \"Nature's God.\""}
