Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (<a0_0><b5_0>1968<b5_0/><a0_0/>), the Supreme Court considered an Arkansas law that made it a crime \"to teach the theory or doctrine <a1_0>that <b6_0>mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals<a1_0/>,\"<b6_0/> or \"to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches\" this theory in any school or university that received public funds. The court's opinion, written by <a2_0><b7_0>Justice Abe Fortas<b7_0/><a2_0/>, ruled that the Arkansas law violated \"the constitutional prohibition of state laws respecting <a3_0>an <b8_0>establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof<b8_0/><a3_0/>. The overriding fact is that Arkansas' law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine; that is, with a particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group.\" The court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion, and that \"[T]he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from <a4_0><b9_0>views distasteful to them<b9_0/><a4_0/>.\" "}
