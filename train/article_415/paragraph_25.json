First, the law or policy must have been adopted with a neutral or <a2_0><b7_0>non-religious<b7_0/><a2_0/> purpose. Second, the principle or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits <a3_0>religion<a3_0/>. Third, the statute or policy must not result in an \"excessive entanglement\" of <a4_0><b9_0>government with <b8_0>religion<b9_0/><b8_0/><a4_0/>. (The decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman hinged upon the conclusion that the government benefits were flowing disproportionately to Catholic schools, and that Catholic schools were an integral component of the Catholic Church's religious mission, thus the policy involved the state in an \"excessive entanglement\" with religion.) Failure to meet any of these criteria is a proof that the statute or policy in question violates the Establishment Clause."}
