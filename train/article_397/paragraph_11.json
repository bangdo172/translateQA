Additionally, PAL's higher resolution results in <b8_0>letterboxing of the output image<b8_0/>. Some commercial PAL region releases exhibit this same problem and, therefore, can be played in NTSC systems without issue while others will face a 20% speedup if played in an NTSC console. To mostly correct this issue, <a3_0>a switch can be added to place the SNES PPU into a 60 Hz mode supported by most newer PAL televisions<a3_0/>. Later games will detect this setting and refuse to run, requiring the switch to be thrown only after the check completes."}
