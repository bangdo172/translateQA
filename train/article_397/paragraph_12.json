The original North American version, designed by Nintendo of America <a2_0>industrial designer<a2_0/> <a1_0>Lance Barr<a1_0/> (who previously redesigned the Famicom to become the NES), has a boxy design with <a3_0>purple<a3_0/> sliding switches and a dark gray eject lever. The loading bay surface is curved, both to invite <b9_0>interact<b9_0/>ion and to prevent <b7_0>food or drinks<b7_0/> from being placed on the console and spilling as had happened with the flat surfaced NES. The Japanese and European versions are more rounded, with darker gray accents and buttons. The North American SNS-101 model and the Japanese Super Famicom Jr. (the SHVC-101 model), all designed by Barr, are both smaller with a rounded contour; however, the SNS-101 buttons are purple where the Super Famicom Jr. buttons are <a4_0><b8_0>gray<b8_0/><a4_0/>. The European and American versions of the SNES controllers have much longer <b5_0>cables<b5_0/> compared to the Japanese Super Famicom controllers."}
