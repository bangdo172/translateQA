While the SNES can address 128 Mbit,[f] only <a2_0>117.75 Mbit<a2_0/> are actually available for cartridge use. A fairly normal mapping could easily address up to 95 Mbit of ROM data (48 Mbit at FastROM speed) with 8 Mbit of battery-backed RAM. However, most available memory access controllers only support <b8_0>mappings of up to 32 Mbit<b8_0/>. The largest games released (<a3_0>Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean<a3_0/>) contain 48 Mbit of ROM data, while the smallest games contain only <a4_0><b7_0><b9_0>2 Mbit<b9_0/><b7_0/><a4_0/>."}
