Both areas had already been partially conquered, but remained difficult to govern. Once again, a particular difficulty concerned the question of the conversion of non-Arabs, especially the Sogdians of Transoxiana. Following the Umayyad defeat in the \"<b7_0>Day of Thirst<b7_0/>\" in <a2_0>724<a2_0/>, <b8_0>Ashras ibn 'Abd Allah al-Sulami<b8_0/>, governor of Khurasan, promised tax relief to those Sogdians who converted to Islam, but went back on his offer when it proved too popular and threatened to reduce tax revenues. Discontent among the Khurasani Arabs rose sharply after the losses suffered in the <a3_0>Battle of the Defile<a3_0/> in 731, and in 734, <a4_0><b9_0>al-Harith ibn Surayj<b9_0/><a4_0/> led a revolt that received broad backing from Arabs and natives alike, capturing Balkh but failing to take Merv. After this defeat, al-Harith's movement seems to have been dissolved, but the problem of the rights of non-Arab Muslims would continue to plague the Umayyads."}
