This caliphate was centered on the Umayyad dynasty (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0648\u064a\u0648\u0646\u200e, al-\u02beUmawiyy\u016bn, or \u0628\u0646\u0648 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0629, Ban\u016b \u02beUmayya, \"Sons of Umayya\"), hailing from Mecca.

Syria remained the Umayyads' main power base thereafter, and Damascus was their capital. The Umayyads continued the Muslim conquests, incorporating the Caucasus, Transoxiana, Sindh, the Maghreb and the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus) into the Muslim world. At its greatest extent, the Umayyad Caliphate covered 15 million km2 (<a3_0><b8_0>5.79<a3_0/> million<b8_0/> square miles), making it the largest empire (in terms of area - not in terms of population) the world had yet seen, and the fifth largest ever to exist."}
