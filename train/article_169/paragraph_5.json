Because Medina had been home to Muhammad and his family, including Husayn, word of his death and the imprisonment of his family led to a large opposition movement. In 683, <a1_0><b8_0>Yazid<b8_0/><a1_0/> dispatched an army to subdue both movements. The army suppressed the Medinese opposition at the <a2_0>Battle of al-Harrah<a2_0/>. <b5_0>The Grand Mosque<b5_0/> in Medina was severely damaged and widespread pillaging caused deep-seated dissent. <b6_0>Yazid's army<b6_0/> continued on and laid siege to <a3_0>Mecca<a3_0/>.
