During the Umayyad period, the majority of people living within the caliphate were not Muslim, but Christian, Jewish, <a2_0>Zoroastrian<a2_0/>, or members of other small groups. These religious communities were not forced to convert to Islam, but were subject to a tax (<a0_0><b3_0>jizyah<b3_0/><a0_0/>) which was not imposed upon Muslims. This situation may actually have made widespread conversion to Islam undesirable from the point of view of state revenue, and there are reports that <b5_0>provincial governors<b5_0/> actively discouraged such conversions. It is not clear how <b6_0><b7_0>Umar<b7_0/><b6_0/> attempted to resolve this situation, but the sources portray him as having insisted on like treatment of Arab and non-Arab (<a1_0><b4_0>mawali<b4_0/><a1_0/>) Muslims, and on the removal of obstacles to the conversion of non-Arabs to Islam."}
