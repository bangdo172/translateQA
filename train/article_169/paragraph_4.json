It was really the caliphate of Uthman Ibn Affan (644\u2013<a1_0>656<a1_0/>), a member of Umayyad clan himself, that witnessed the revival and then the ascendancy of the Umayyad clan to the corridors of power. <b6_0>Uthman<b6_0/> placed some of the trusted members of his clan at prominent and strong positions throughout the state. Most notable was the appointment of <a2_0><b5_0>Marwan ibn al-Hakam<b5_0/><a2_0/>, Uthman's first cousin, as his top advisor, which created a stir among the Hashimite companions of Muhammad, as Marwan along with his father Al-Hakam ibn Abi al-'As had been permanently exiled from Medina by Muhammad during his lifetime. Uthman also appointed as governor of Kufa his half-brother, Walid ibn Uqba, who was accused by Hashmites of leading prayer while under the influence of alcohol. Uthman also consolidated Muawiyah's governorship of Syria by granting him control over a larger area and appointed his foster brother Abdullah ibn Saad as the Governor of Egypt. However, since Uthman <b7_0>never named an heir<b7_0/>, he cannot be considered the founder of a dynasty."}
