The battle saw <a0_0><b5_0>three<b5_0/><a0_0/> top leaders of the Umayyad clan (Utba ibn Rabi'ah, Walid ibn Utbah and Shaybah) killed by Hashimites (Ali, Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib and Ubaydah ibn al-Harith) in a three-on-three melee. This fueled the opposition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, the grandson of <b6_0>Umayya<b6_0/>, to Muhammad and to Islam. <b7_0>Abu Sufyan<b7_0/> sought to exterminate the adherents of the new religion by waging another battle with Muslims based in Medina only a year after the Battle of Badr. He did this to avenge the defeat at Badr. <b8_0>The <a2_0>Battle of Uhud<b8_0/><a2_0/> is generally believed by scholars to be the first defeat for the Muslims, as they had incurred greater losses than the Meccans. After the battle, Abu Sufyan's wife <a3_0>Hind<a3_0/>, who was also the daughter of <b9_0>Utba ibn Rabi'ah<b9_0/>, is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Within five years after his defeat in the Battle of Uhud, however, Muhammad took control of Mecca and announced a general amnesty for all. Abu Sufyan and his wife Hind embraced Islam on the eve of the conquest of Mecca, as did their son (the future caliph <a4_0>Muawiyah I<a4_0/>)."}
