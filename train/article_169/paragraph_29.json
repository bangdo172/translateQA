The Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik developed a regular postal service. <b7_0>Umar bin Abdul-Aziz<b7_0/> developed it further by building caravanserais at stages along the <a1_0>Khurasan<a1_0/> highway. Relays of horses were used for the conveyance of dispatches between the caliph and his agents and officials posted in the provinces. The main highways were divided into stages of 12 miles (<a4_0>19<a4_0/> km) each and each stage had horses, <a2_0>donkeys<a2_0/> or camels ready to carry the post. Primarily the service met the needs of Government officials, but travellers and their important dispatches were also benefitted by the system. The postal carriages were also used for the swift transport of troops. They were able to carry fifty to a hundred men at a time.
