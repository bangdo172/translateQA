The <b3_0>Christian and Jewish<b3_0/> population had still autonomy; their judicial matters were dealt with in accordance with their own laws and by their own religious heads or their appointees, although they did pay a poll tax for policing to the central state. Muhammad had stated explicitly during his lifetime that abrahamic religious groups (still a majority in times of the Umayyad Caliphate), should be allowed to practice their own religion, provided that they paid the <a0_0>jizya<a0_0/> taxation. The welfare state of both the Muslim and the non-Muslim poor started by <b4_0>Umar ibn al Khattab<b4_0/> had also continued. Muawiya's wife <a1_0>Maysum<a1_0/> (Yazid's mother) was also a <a2_0>Christian<a2_0/>. The relations between the Muslims and the Christians in the state were stable in this time. The Umayyads were involved in frequent battles with the Christian Byzantines without being concerned with protecting themselves in <b7_0>Syria<b7_0/>, which had remained largely Christian like many other parts of the empire. Prominent positions were held by <b5_0>Christians<b5_0/>, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious assimilation that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, as in Syria. <b6_0>This policy<b6_0/> also boosted Muawiya's popularity and solidified Syria as his power base."}
