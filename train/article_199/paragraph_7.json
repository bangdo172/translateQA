It is often called \"<a3_0>piracy<a3_0/>\". While <b5_0>copyright<b5_0/> is created the instance a work is fixed, generally the copyright holder can only get money damages if the owner registers the copyright.[citation needed] Enforcement of <b8_0>copyright<b8_0/> is generally the responsibility of the copyright holder. The ACTA trade agreement, signed in <a0_0>May 2011<a0_0/> by <b7_0>the <a1_0>United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU<b7_0/><a1_0/>, and which has not entered into force, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to active police for infringement. There are limitations and exceptions to copyright, allowing limited use of copyrighted works, which does not constitute infringement. Examples of such doctrines are <b6_0>the <a2_0>fair use and fair dealing<a2_0/> doctrine<b6_0/>."}
