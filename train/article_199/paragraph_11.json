He claims that the term \"operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues\" and that it creates a \"<b7_0>bias<b7_0/>\" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to \"property rights\". Stallman advocates referring to <b6_0>copyrights, patents and trademarks<b6_0/> <a3_0>in the singular<a3_0/> and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term."}
