In the United States, <b6_0>trade secrets<b6_0/> are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the <a1_0>Uniform Trade Secrets Act<a1_0/>. The United States also has federal law in the form of the <a2_0>Economic Espionage Act<a2_0/> of 1996 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1831\u20131839), which makes the <b8_0>theft or misappropriation of a <b7_0>trade secret<b8_0/><b7_0/> a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831(a), criminalizes the <b9_0>theft of trade secrets<b9_0/> to benefit foreign powers. The second, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as <a3_0>an equitable right<a3_0/> rather than <a4_0>a property right<a4_0/> but penalties for theft are roughly the same as the United States.[citation needed]"}
