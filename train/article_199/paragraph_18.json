In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to <b5_0>the property that is produced by their labor<b5_0/>. Additionally Congress's awareness of <b7_0>the position of the <a2_0>United States<a2_0/> as the world's largest producer of films<b7_0/> has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property.
