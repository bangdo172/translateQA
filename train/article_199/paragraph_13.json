They argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non-rivalrous (that is, if one makes a copy of a work, the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original). Other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with <a2_0><b6_0>tangible<a2_0/> property<b6_0/>, there is no natural scarcity of a particular idea or information: once it exists at all, it can be re-used and duplicated <a3_0>indefinitely<a3_0/> without such re-use diminishing the original. <a1_0><b5_0>Stephan Kinsella<b5_0/><a1_0/> has objected to <b7_0>intellectual property<b7_0/> on the grounds that the word \"property\" implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas."}
