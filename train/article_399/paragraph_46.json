It comprises numerous islets around a central lagoon that is approximately 25.1 kilometres (15.6 miles) (N\u2013S) by 18.4 kilometres (11.4 miles) (W-E), centred on <a2_0>179\u00b07'E and 8\u00b030'S<a2_0/>. On the atolls, an annular reef rim surrounds the lagoon with several natural reef channels. Surveys were carried out in May 2010 of the reef habitats of Nanumea, Nukulaelae and Funafuti and a total of 317 fish species were recorded during this Tuvalu Marine Life study.
