In 1998, Tuvalu began deriving revenue from the use of its area code for premium-rate telephone numbers and from the commercialisation of its \".tv\" Internet domain name, which is now managed by <a2_0>Verisign<a2_0/> until 2021. The \".tv\" domain name generates around <a0_0>$2.2 million<a0_0/> each year from royalties, which is about <a3_0>ten per cent<a3_0/> of the government's total revenue. Domain name income paid most of the cost of paving the streets of Funafuti and installing street lighting in mid-2002. Tuvalu also generates income from stamps by the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau and income from the <a4_0>Tuvalu Ship Registry<a4_0/>."}
