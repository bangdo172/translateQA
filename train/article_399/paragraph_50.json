The coral bleaching, which includes staghorn corals, is attributed to the increase in <a1_0>water temperature<a1_0/> that occurred during the El Ni\u00f1os that occurred from 1998\u20132000 and from 2000\u20132001. A <a2_0>reef restoration<a2_0/> project has investigated reef restoration techniques; and researchers from Japan have investigated rebuilding the coral reefs through the introduction of <a3_0>foraminifera<a3_0/>. The project of the Japan International Cooperation Agency is designed to increase the resilience of the Tuvalu coast against sea level rise through <a4_0>ecosystem rehabilitation<a4_0/> and regeneration and through support for sand production."}
