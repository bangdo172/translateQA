The community council is the <a2_0>Falekaupule<a2_0/> (the traditional assembly of elders) or te sina o fenua (literally: \"grey-hairs of the land\"). In the past, another caste, the priests (<a3_0>tofuga<a3_0/>), were also amongst the decision-makers. The ulu-aliki and aliki exercise informal authority at the local level. Ulu-aliki are always chosen based on ancestry. Under the Falekaupule Act (1997), the powers and functions of the Falekaupule are now shared with the <a4_0>pule o kaupule<a4_0/> (elected village presidents; one on each atoll)."}
