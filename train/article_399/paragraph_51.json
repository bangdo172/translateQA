The Waste Operations and Services Act of 2009 provides the legal framework for waste management and pollution control projects funded by the <a3_0>European Union<a3_0/> directed at organic waste composting in eco-sanitation systems. The Environment Protection (Litter and Waste Control) Regulation 2013 is intended to improve the management of the importation of non-biodegradable materials.
