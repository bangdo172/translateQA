The Janet Nicoll visited three of the Ellice Islands; while Fanny records that they made landfall at Funafuti, Niutao and Nanumea, Jane Resture suggests that it was more likely they landed at Nukufetau rather than Funafuti. An account of this voyage was written by Fanny Stevenson and published under the title <a4_0>The Cruise of the Janet Nichol<a4_0/>, together with photographs taken by Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne."}
