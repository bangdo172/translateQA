This investigation followed the work on <a4_0>The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs<a4_0/> conducted by <a3_0>Charles Darwin<a3_0/> in the Pacific. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1898. Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney was a member of the 1896 \"Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society\", under Professor William Sollas and lead the expedition in 1897. Photographers on these trips recorded people, communities, and scenes at Funafuti."}
