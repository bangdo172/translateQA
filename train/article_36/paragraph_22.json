In such a context one can conflate materialism with atheism. Most of <b5_0>Hinduism<b5_0/> and transcendentalism regards all matter as an illusion called Maya, blinding humans from knowing \"the truth\". Maya is the limited, purely physical and mental reality in which our everyday consciousness has become entangled. <b4_0>Maya<b4_0/> gets destroyed for a person when s/he perceives Brahman with transcendental knowledge."}
