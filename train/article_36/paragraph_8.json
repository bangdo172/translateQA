Non-reductive materialism explicitly rejects this notion, however, taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects, properties, or phenomena not explicable in the terms canonically used for the basic material constituents. Jerry Fodor influentially argues this view, <b2_0>according to which empirical laws and explanations in \"special sciences\" like <b3_0>psychology or geology<b3_0/> are invisible from the perspective of <b4_0>basic<b4_0/> physics<b2_0/>. A lot of vigorous literature has grown up around the relation between these views."}
