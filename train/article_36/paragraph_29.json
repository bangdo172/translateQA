In recent years, Paul and Patricia Churchland have advocated a radically contrasting position (at least, in regards to certain hypotheses); eliminativist materialism holds that some <b2_0>mental phenomena simply do not exist at all<b2_0/>, and that talk of those mental phenomena reflects a totally spurious \"folk psychology\" and introspection illusion. That is, an <b3_0>eliminative materialist<b3_0/> might suggest that a concept like \"belief\" simply has no basis in fact - the way folk science speaks of demon-caused illnesses. Reductive materialism being at one end of a continuum (our theories will reduce to facts) and <b4_0>eliminative materialism<b4_0/> on the other (certain theories will need to be eliminated in light of new facts), Revisionary materialism is somewhere in the middle."}
