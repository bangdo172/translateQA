It is also called \"intelligence\" or \"the light of truth\", which like all observable matter \"was not created or made, neither indeed can be\". Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints view the revelations of Joseph Smith as a restoration of original Christian doctrine, which they believe post-apostolic theologians began to corrupt in the centuries after Christ. The writings of many[quantify] of these theologians indicate a clear influence of Greek metaphysical philosophies such as Neoplatonism, which characterized divinity as an utterly <a0_0>simple, immaterial, formless, substance/essence (ousia) that transcended all that was physical<a0_0/>. Despite strong opposition from many <a1_0>Christians<a1_0/>, this metaphysical depiction of God eventually became incorporated into the doctrine of the Christian church, displacing the original Judeo-Christian concept of a physical, corporeal God who created humans in His image and likeness."}
