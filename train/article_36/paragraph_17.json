Relativity shows that <a0_0><b3_0>matter and <a1_0>energy<b3_0/><a1_0/><a0_0/> (including the spatially distributed <b4_0>energy<b4_0/> of <a2_0>fields<a2_0/>) are interchangeable. This enables the ontological view that energy is prima materia and matter is one of its forms. On the other hand, the Standard Model of Particle physics uses quantum field theory to describe all interactions. On this view it could be said that fields are prima materia and the energy is a property of the <b5_0>field<b5_0/>."}
