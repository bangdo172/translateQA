In <a2_0>1202<a2_0/> he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of Grand Duke of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, Prince Daniil (r. <b7_0>1238\u20131264<b7_0/>) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Russia\") from the Roman papacy, apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople granted the <b8_0>King of Poland a metropolitan for his Russian subjects<b8_0/>. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. <a3_0>Cyprian<a3_0/>, a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the Russian countries was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Galich and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule."}
