In <a2_0>894<a2_0/>, <b6_0>the Magyars and Pechenegs<b6_0/> were drawn into the wars between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire. <b7_0>The Byzantines<b7_0/> arranged for the Magyars to attack Bulgarian territory from the north, and Bulgaria in turn persuaded the Pechenegs to attack the Magyars from their rear. Boxed in, <b8_0>the Magyars<b8_0/> were forced to migrate further west across the Carpathian Mountains into the Hungarian plain, depriving the Khazars of an important ally and a buffer from the Rus'. The migration of the Magyars allowed Rus' access to the Black Sea, and they soon launched excursions into Khazar territory along the sea coast, up the Don river, and into the lower Volga region. The Rus' were raiding and plundering into the Caspian Sea region from 864, with the first large-scale expedition in <a3_0>913<a3_0/>, when they extensively raided Baku, Gilan, Mazandaran and penetrated into the Caucasus."}
