A navy of <a1_0><b5_0>10,000<b5_0/> vessels<a1_0/>, including Pecheneg allies, landed on the Bithynian coast and devastated the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. The attack was well-timed, perhaps due to intelligence, as the <a2_0><b6_0>Byzantine fleet was occupied with the Arabs<b6_0/><a2_0/> in the Mediterranean, and the bulk of its army was stationed in the east. The Rus\u2019 burned towns, churches, and monasteries, butchering the people and amassing booty. The emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be <a3_0>outfitted <b7_0>with Greek fire throwers<b7_0/><a3_0/> and sent them out to meet the Rus\u2019, luring them into surrounding the contingent before unleashing the Greek fire. Liutprand of Cremona wrote that \"the Rus', seeing the flames, jumped overboard, preferring water to fire. Some sank, weighed down by the weight of their breastplates and helmets; others caught fire.\" Those captured were beheaded. The ploy dispelled the Rus\u2019 fleet, but their attacks continued into the hinterland as far as Nicomedia, with many atrocities reported as victims were crucified and set up for use as targets. At last a Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to drive the Rus' back, and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the Rus' fleet on its return voyage (possibly an exaggeration since the Rus' soon mounted another attack). The outcome indicates increased military might by Byzantium since <b8_0>911<b8_0/>, suggesting a shift in the balance of power."}
