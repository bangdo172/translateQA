In addition, the AV Famicom joined its international counterpart and dropped the hardwired controllers in favor of detachable controller ports. However, the controllers included with the Famicom AV had cables which were 90 cm (3 feet) long, as opposed to the standard 180 cm(<a4_0><b9_0>6 feet<b9_0/><a4_0/>) of NES controllers."}
