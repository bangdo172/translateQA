The console's <b6_0>2<b6_0/> kB of onboard RAM may be used for tile maps and attributes on the NES board and 8 kB of tile pattern ROM or RAM may be included on a cartridge. The system has an available color palette of <a2_0><b7_0>48<b7_0/><a2_0/> colors and <a3_0><b8_0>6<b8_0/><a3_0/> grays. Up to 25 simultaneous colors may be used without writing new values mid-frame: a background color, four sets of three tile colors and four sets of three sprite colors. The NES palette is based on NTSC rather than RGB values. A total of 64 sprites may be displayed onscreen at a given time without reloading sprites mid-screen. The standard display resolution of the NES is <a4_0><b9_0>256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
