Original plans called for an advanced <a1_0><b6_0>16<a1_0/>-bit<b6_0/> system which would function as a full-fledged computer with a keyboard and floppy disk drive, but Nintendo president <a2_0><b7_0>Hiroshi Yamauchi<b7_0/><a2_0/> rejected this and instead decided to go for a cheaper, more conventional cartridge-based game console as he felt that features such as keyboards and disks were intimidating to non-technophiles. A test model was constructed in <a3_0><b8_0>October 1982<b8_0/><a3_0/> to verify the functionality of the hardware, after which work began on programming tools. Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time, no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch. Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an <a4_0><b9_0>NEC PC-8001<b9_0/><a4_0/> computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time.[citation needed]"}
