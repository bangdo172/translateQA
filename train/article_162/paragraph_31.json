However, Tengen also obtained a description of the lockout chip from the <a3_0><b7_0>United States Patent and Trademark Office<b7_0/><a3_0/> by falsely claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims in a legal case. Nintendo sued Tengen for <a1_0><b5_0>copyright infringement<b5_0/><a1_0/>, which Tengen lost as it could not prove that the legally obtained patent documents had not been used by the reverse engineering team. Tengen's antitrust claims against Nintendo were never finally decided."}
