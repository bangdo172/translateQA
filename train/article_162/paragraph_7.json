Both controllers had a Turbo feature, a feature where one tap of the button represented multiple taps. This feature allowed players to <a1_0><b6_0>shoot much faster during shooter games<b6_0/><a1_0/>. The NES Advantage had two knobs that adjusted the firing rate of the turbo button from quick to Turbo, as well as a \"Slow\" button that slowed down the game by rapidly pausing the game. The \"Slow\" button did not work with games that had a pause menu or pause screen and can interfere with jumping and shooting. <a2_0>The NES Max<a2_0/> also had the Turbo Feature, but it was not adjustable, in contrast with the Advantage. It also did not have the <a4_0>\"<b9_0>Slow<b9_0/>\" button<a4_0/>. Its wing-like shape made it easier to hold than the Advantage and it also improved on the joystick. Turbo features were also featured on the NES Satellite, the NES Four Score, and the U-Force. Other accessories include the <a3_0><b8_0>Power Pad and the Power Glove<b8_0/><a3_0/>, which was featured in the movie The Wizard."}
