Instead, during the first year of Nintendo's successor console the Super Famicom (named Super Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan), the Famicom remained the second highest-selling video game console in Japan, outselling the newer and more powerful NEC PC Engine and Sega Mega Drive by a wide margin. The console remained popular in Japan and North America until <a1_0><b6_0>late 1993<b6_0/><a1_0/>, when the demand for new NES software abruptly plummeted. The final Famicom game released in Japan is Takahashi Meijin no B\u014dken Jima IV (Adventure Island IV), while in North America, <a2_0><b7_0>Wario's Woods<b7_0/><a2_0/> is the final licensed game. In the wake of ever decreasing sales and the lack of new software titles, Nintendo of America officially discontinued the NES by <a3_0><b8_0>1995<b8_0/><a3_0/>. However, Nintendo kept producing new Famicom units in Japan until September 25, 2003, and continued to repair Famicom consoles until <a4_0><b9_0>October 31, 2007<b9_0/><a4_0/>, attributing the discontinuation of support to insufficient supplies of parts."}
