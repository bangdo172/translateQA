The original HVC-001 model of the Family Computer featured only <a0_0><b4_0>radio frequency<b4_0/> <b7_0>(RF)<a0_0/> modulator<b7_0/> output. When the console was released in North America and Europe, support for <b5_0>composite video<b5_0/> through RCA connectors was added in addition to the RF modulator. The HVC-101 model of the Famicom dropped the RF modulator entirely and adopted <a1_0>composite video<a1_0/> output via a proprietary <a2_0><b6_0>12<b6_0/><a2_0/>-pin \"multi-out\" connector first introduced for the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Conversely, the North American re-released NES-101 model most closely resembled the original HVC-001 model Famicom, in that it featured <a3_0>RF modulator<a3_0/> output only. Finally, the PlayChoice-10 utilized an inverted RGB video output."}
