The video game market crash of <a0_0><b4_0>1983<b4_0/><a0_0/> had occurred in significant part due to a lack of consumer and retailer confidence in video games, which had in turn been due partially to confusion and misrepresentation in the <a1_0><b5_0>marketing<b5_0/><a1_0/> of video games. Prior to the NES, the packaging of many video games presented bombastic <a2_0><b6_0>artwork<b6_0/><a2_0/> which exaggerated the graphics of the actual game. In terms of product identity, a single game such as Pac-Man would appear in many versions on many different game consoles and computers, with large variations in graphics, sound, and general quality between the versions. By stark contrast, Nintendo's marketing strategy aimed to regain consumer and retailer <a3_0><b7_0>confidence<b7_0/><a3_0/>, by delivering a singular platform whose technology was not in need of heavy exaggeration and whose qualities were clearly defined."}
