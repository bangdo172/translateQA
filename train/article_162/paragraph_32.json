It also loads cartridges through a covered slot on the top of the unit and uses non-hardwired controllers. Because <a1_0><b6_0>HVC-101<b6_0/><a1_0/> used composite video output instead of being RF only like the <a2_0>HVC-001<a2_0/>, Nintendo marketed the newer model as the <a3_0><b8_0>AV Famicom<b8_0/><a3_0/> (AV\u4ed5\u69d8\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Eibui Shiy\u014d Famikon?). Since the new controllers don't have microphones on them like the second controller on the original console, certain games such as the Disk System version of The Legend of Zelda and Raid on Bungeling Bay will have certain tricks that cannot be replicated when played on an <b7_0>HVC-101<b7_0/> Famicom without a modded controller. However, the HVC-101 Famicom is compatible with most NES controllers due to having the same controller port. Nintendo had also released a <a4_0>3D <b9_0>graphic capable headset<b9_0/><a4_0/>. However, this peripheral was never released outside Japan.[citation needed]"}
