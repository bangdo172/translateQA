A few unlicensed games released in <a2_0><b6_0>Europe and Australia<b6_0/><a2_0/> came in the form of a dongle that would be connected to a licensed game, in order to use the licensed game's 10NES chip for authentication. In order to combat unlicensed games, Nintendo of America <a3_0><b7_0>threatened retailers<b7_0/><a3_0/> who sold them with losing their supply of licensed titles. In addition, multiple revisions were made to the NES PCBs to prevent these games from working."}
