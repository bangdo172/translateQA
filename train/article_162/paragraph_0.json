However, it was eventually decided that children might step on joysticks left on the floor and their durability was also questioned. <a0_0><b4_0>Katsuyah Nakawaka<b4_0/><a0_0/> attached a <b7_0>Game & Watch<b7_0/> D-pad to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and had no discomfort. Ultimately though, they did install a <a1_0><b5_0>15-pin expansion port<b5_0/><a1_0/> on the front of the console so that an arcade-style joystick could be used optionally.
