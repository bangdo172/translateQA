Before the NES/Famicom, Nintendo was known as a moderately successful Japanese toy and <a0_0><b4_0>playing card<b4_0/><a0_0/> manufacturer, and the popularity of the NES/Famicom helped the company grow into an internationally recognized name almost synonymous with video games as <a1_0><b5_0>Atari<b5_0/><a1_0/> had been during the 2600 era and set the stage for Japanese dominance of the video game industry. With the NES, Nintendo also changed the relationship of console manufacturers and third-party software developers by restricting developers from publishing and distributing software without <a2_0><b6_0>licensed approval<b6_0/><a2_0/>.
