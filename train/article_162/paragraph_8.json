It contains RAM for the game to load into and an extra single-cycle wavetable-lookup sound chip. The disks were originally obtained from <a1_0><b6_0>kiosks in malls<b6_0/><a1_0/> and other public places where <a2_0><b7_0>buyers could select a title and have it written to the disk<b7_0/><a2_0/>. This process would cost less than cartridges and users could take the disk back to a vending booth and have it rewritten with a new game. The disks were used both for <a3_0><b8_0>storing the game and saving progress<b8_0/><a3_0/> and total capacity was <a4_0><b9_0>128k<b9_0/><a4_0/> (64k per side)."}
