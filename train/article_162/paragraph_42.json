Initially, such clones were popular in markets where Nintendo never issued a legitimate version of the console. In particular, the <a0_0><b5_0>Dendy<b5_0/><a0_0/> (Russian: \u0414\u0435\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0438), an unlicensed hardware clone produced in Taiwan and sold in the former <a1_0><b6_0>Soviet Union<a1_0/>,<b6_0/> emerged as the most popular video game console of its time in that setting and it enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the NES/Famicom in North America and Japan. A Famicom clone was marketed in <a2_0><b7_0>Argentina<b7_0/><a2_0/> under the name of \"Family Game\", resembling the original hardware design. The Micro Genius (Simplified Chinese: \u5c0f\u5929\u624d) was marketed in Southeast Asia as an alternative to the Famicom; Samurai was the popular PAL alternative to the NES; and in Central Europe, especially Poland, the <a3_0><b8_0>Pegasus<b8_0/><a3_0/> was available. <a4_0><b9_0>Samurai<b9_0/><a4_0/> was also available in India in early 90s which was the first instance of console gaming in India."}
