This is the system which would eventually be officially deployed as the Nintendo Entertainment System, or the colloquial \"<a0_0><b4_0>NES<b4_0/><a0_0/>\". Nintendo seeded these first systems to limited American test markets starting in <a2_0><b6_0>New York City<b6_0/><a2_0/> on <a1_0><b5_0>October 18, 1985<b5_0/><a1_0/>, following up with a full-fledged North American release of the console in February of the following year. Nintendo released 17 launch titles: 10-Yard Fight, Baseball, Clu Clu Land, Duck Hunt, Excitebike, Golf, Gyromite, Hogan\u2019s Alley, Ice Climber, Kung Fu, Pinball, Soccer, Stack-Up, Tennis, Wild Gunman, Wrecking Crew, and Super Mario Bros.h[\u203a] Some varieties of these launch games contained Famicom chips with an adapter inside the cartridge so they would play on North American consoles, which is why the title screen of Gyromite has the Famicom title \"Robot Gyro\" and the title screen of Stack-Up has the Famicom title \"Robot Block\"."}
