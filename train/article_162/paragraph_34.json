Nintendo entered into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari\u2019s name as the name <a0_0><b4_0>Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System<b4_0/><a0_0/>. The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in <a1_0><b5_0>June 1983<b5_0/><a1_0/>. However, Atari discovered at that show that its competitor <a2_0><b6_0>Coleco<b6_0/><a2_0/> was illegally demonstrating its Coleco Adam computer with Nintendo's Donkey Kong game. This violation of Atari's exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo's game console marketing contract with Atari. Atari's CEO <a3_0><b7_0>Ray Kassar<b7_0/><a3_0/> was fired the next month, so the deal went nowhere, and Nintendo decided to market its system on its own.g[\u203a]"}
