This has been shown to have <a1_0><b6_0>positive effects on the educational outcomes and experiences of college students<a1_0/> as well as the teaching of faculty members<b6_0/>. According to a study by Geoffrey Maruyama and Jos\u00e9 F. Moreno, the results showed that faculty members believed diversity <a2_0><b7_0>helps students to reach the essential goals of a college education<b7_0/><a2_0/>, <a3_0><b8_0>Caucasian students<b8_0/><a3_0/> suffer no detrimental effects from classroom diversity, and that attention to multicultural learning improves the ability of colleges and universities to accomplish their missions. Furthermore, a diverse population of students offers unique perspectives in order to challenge preconceived notions through exposure to the experiences and ideas of others. According to Professor Gurin of the University of Michigan, skills such as \"perspective-taking, acceptance of differences, a willingness and capacity to find commonalities among differences, acceptance of conflict as normal, conflict resolution, participation in democracy, and interest in the wider social world\" can potentially be developed in college while being exposed to heterogeneous group of students. In addition, broadening perspectives helps students confront personal and substantive stereotypes and fosters discussion about racial and ethnic issues in a classroom setting. Furthermore, the <b9_0>2000<b9_0/> AAUP study states that having a diversity of views leads to a better discussion and greater understanding among the students on issues of race, tolerance, fairness, etc."}
