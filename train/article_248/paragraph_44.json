Princeton Dean of Admissions <a2_0><b7_0>Janet Rapelye<b7_0/><a2_0/> responded to the claims in the November 30, 2006, issue of the Daily Princetonian by stating that \"the numbers don't indicate [discrimination].\" She said that Li was not admitted because \"<a3_0><b8_0>many others had far better qualifications<b8_0/><a3_0/>.\" Li's extracurricular activities were described as \"not all that outstanding\". Li countered in an email, saying that his <a4_0>placement on the waitlist<a4_0/> undermines Rapelye's claim. \"Princeton had initially <b9_0>waitlisted<b9_0/> my application,\" Li said. \"So if it were not for a yield which was higher than expected, the admissions office very well may have admitted a candidate whose \"outside activities were not all that outstanding\"."}
