Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or <a0_0><b5_0>gender quotas<b5_0/><a0_0/> for collegiate admission, have been criticized as a form of <a1_0>reverse<a1_0/> discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of <a2_0><b7_0>Gratz v. Bollinger<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Affirmative action as a practice was upheld by the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003. Affirmative action policies were developed in order to correct decades of discrimination stemming from the <a3_0><b8_0>Reconstruction Era<b8_0/><a3_0/> by granting disadvantaged minorities opportunities. Many believe that the diversity of current American society suggests that affirmative action policies succeeded and are no longer required.
