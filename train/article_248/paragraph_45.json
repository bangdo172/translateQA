The University of Texas employs the \"Top Ten Percent Law\", under which admission to any public college or university in Texas is guaranteed to high school students who graduate in the top ten percent of their high school class. Fisher has brought the admissions policy to court because she believes that she was denied acceptance to the University of Texas based on her race, and thus, her right to equal protection according to the 14th Amendment was violated. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Fisher on October 10, 2012, and rendered an ambiguous ruling in 2013 that sent the case back to the lower court, stipulating only that the University must demonstrate that it could not achieve diversity through other, non-race sensitive means. In July 2014, the <a3_0><b8_0>US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit<b8_0/><a3_0/> concluded that U of T maintained a \"holistic\" approach in its application of affirmative action, and could continue the practice. On February 10, 2015, lawyers for Fisher filed a new case in the Supreme Court. It is a renewed complaint that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit got the issue wrong \u2014 on the second try as well as on the first. The Supreme Court agreed in June 2015 to hear the case a second time. It will likely be decided by <a4_0><b9_0>June 2016<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
