Sander published an article in the November 2004 issue of the <a1_0><b6_0>Stanford Law Review<b6_0/><a1_0/> that questioned the effectiveness of racial preferences in law schools. He noted that, prior to his article, there had been no comprehensive study on the effects of affirmative action. The article presents a study that shows that <a2_0><b7_0>half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class after the first year of law school<b7_0/><a2_0/> and that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam. The article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black lawyers in the United States would grow by <a3_0><b8_0>eight percent<b8_0/><a3_0/> if affirmative action programs at all law schools were ended. Less qualified black students would attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched in abilities with their classmates and thus perform relatively better. Sander helped to develop a socioeconomically-based affirmative action plan for the UCLA School of Law after the passage of <a4_0><b9_0>Proposition 209<b9_0/><a4_0/> in 1996, which prohibited the use of racial preferences by public universities in California. This change occurred after studies showed that the graduation rate of blacks at UCLA was 41%, compared to 73% for whites."}
