For example, about half of black college students rank in the <a2_0><b6_0>bottom 20 percent<b6_0/><a2_0/> of their classes, black law school graduates are <a3_0><b7_0>four times<b7_0/><a3_0/> as likely to fail bar exams as are whites, and interracial friendships are more likely to form among students with relatively similar levels of academic preparation; thus, blacks and Hispanics are more socially integrated on campuses where they are less academically mismatched. He claims that the supposed \"beneficiaries\" of affirmative action \u2013 minorities \u2013 do not actually benefit and rather are harmed by the policy. Sander's claims have been disputed, and his empirical analyses have been subject to substantial criticism. A group including some of the country's lead statistical methodologists told the Supreme Court that Sander's analyses were sufficiently flawed that the Court would be wise to ignore them entirely. At the same time many scholars have found that minorities gain substantially from affirmative action."}
