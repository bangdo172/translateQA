Truman, himself a combat veteran of World War I, issued Executive Order 9808 establishing the <a0_0><b5_0>President's Committee on Civil Rights<b5_0/><a0_0/> to examine the violence and recommend appropriate federal legislation. Hearing of the incident, Truman turned to NAACP leader Walter Francis White and declared, \"My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that. We've got to do something.\" In <a2_0><b7_0>1947<b7_0/><a2_0/> the committee published its findings, To Secure These Rights. The book was widely read, influential, and considered utopian for the times: \"In our land men are equal, but they are free to be different. From these very differences among our people has come the great human and national strength of America.\" The report discussed and demonstrated racial discrimination in basic freedoms, education, public facilities, personal safety, and employment opportunities. The committee was disturbed by <a3_0>the state of race relations<a3_0/>, and included the evacuation of Americans of Japanese descent during the war \"made without a trial or any sort of hearing\u2026Fundamental to our whole system of law is the belief that guilt is personal and not a matter of heredity or association.\" The recommendations were radical, calling for federal policies and laws to end racial discrimination and bring about equality: \"We can tolerate no restrictions upon the individual which depend upon irrelevant factors such as his race, his color, his religion, or the social position to which he is born.\" To Secure These Rights set the liberal legislative agenda for the next generation that eventually would be signed into law by <a4_0><b8_0>Lyndon B. Johnson<b8_0/><a4_0/>.:35\u201336"}
