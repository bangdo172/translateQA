Many conservatives accused it of advocating <a1_0>a <b6_0>de facto quota system<b6_0/><a1_0/>, and claimed unconstitutionality as it attempts to regulate the workplace. Minnesota Senator <a2_0><b7_0>Hubert Humphrey<b7_0/><a2_0/> corrected this notion: \"there is nothing in [<b5_0>Title VII<b5_0/>] that will give power to the Commission to require hiring, firing, and promotion to meet a racial 'quota.' [. . .] Title VII is designed to encourage the hiring on basis of ability and qualifications, not race or religion.\" Title VII prohibits discrimination. Humphrey was the silent hero of the bill's passing through Congress. He pledged that the bill required no quotas, just nondiscrimination. Doing so, he convinced many pro-business Republicans, including <a4_0><b9_0>Senate Minority Leader<b9_0/><a4_0/> <a3_0><b8_0>Everett Dirksen<b8_0/><a3_0/> (IL) to support Title VII.:78\u201380"}
