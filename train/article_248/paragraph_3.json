Wagner<b6_0/><a1_0/> of New York, the Wagner Act was in line with President Roosevelt's goal of providing economic security to workers and other low-income groups. During this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire <a2_0><b7_0>employees associated with unions<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The Wagner Act allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated against, and empowered a <a3_0><b8_0>National Labor Relations Board<b8_0/><a3_0/> to review potential cases of worker discrimination. In the event of discrimination, employees were to be restored to an appropriate status in the company through 'affirmative action'. While the Wagner Act protected workers and unions it did not protect <a4_0><b9_0>minorities<b9_0/><a4_0/>, who, exempting the Congress of Industrial Organizations, were often barred from union ranks.:11 This original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today, but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individual's unjust treatment.[citation needed]"}
