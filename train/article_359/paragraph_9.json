However, according to Nader El-Bizri, the physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965\u20131039) and the Mu'tazili theologians disagreed with Aristotle and Al-Farabi, and they supported the existence of a void. Using geometry, Ibn al-Haytham mathematically demonstrated that <a1_0>place (al-makan) <b5_0>is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body<b5_0/><a1_0/>. According to Ahmad Dallal, <a2_0>Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b<a2_0/> also states that \"there is no observable evidence that rules out <b9_0>the possibility of vacuum<b9_0/>\".
