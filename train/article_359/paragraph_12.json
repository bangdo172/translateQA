Borrowing somewhat from the pneuma of Stoic physics, aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see Aether <b8_0>(mythology))<b8_0/>. Early theories of light posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed Isaac Newton's explanations of both refraction and of radiant heat. 19th century experiments into this luminiferous aether attempted to detect <b9_0>a minute drag<b9_0/> on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. In 1912, astronomer <a2_0>Henry Pickering<a2_0/> commented: <a1_0>\"While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, [it] is characteris<a1_0/>tic of a gas, and <b5_0>free gaseous molecules<b5_0/> are certainly there\"."}
