This theory helped refine the predictions of his earlier formulated Dirac equation, and successfully predicted the existence of <b7_0>the positron<b7_0/>, confirmed <b8_0>two years<b8_0/> later. <a4_0>Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle<a4_0/> formulated in <a3_0>1927,<a3_0/> predict a fundamental limit within which instantaneous position and momentum, or <b9_0>energy and time<b9_0/> can be measured. This has far reaching consequences on the \"emptiness\" of space between particles. In the <a2_0>late 20th century<a2_0/>, so-called virtual particles that arise spontaneously from empty space were confirmed."}
