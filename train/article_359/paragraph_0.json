The word stems from the Latin adjective <a0_0><b5_0>vacuus<b5_0/><a0_0/> for \"vacant\" or \"void\". An approximation to such vacuum is <b6_0>a region with a <a3_0>gaseous<a3_0/> pressure<b6_0/> much less than atmospheric pressure. Physicists often discuss <b7_0>ideal test results<b7_0/> that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call \"vacuum\" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to <b8_0>an actual <a1_0>imperfect vacuum<b8_0/><a1_0/> as one might have in a laboratory or in space. In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure. The Latin term <a4_0><b9_0>in vacuo<b9_0/><a4_0/> is used to describe an object as being in what would otherwise be a vacuum."}
