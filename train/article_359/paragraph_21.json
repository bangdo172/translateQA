In quantum electrodynamics this vacuum is referred to as <b8_0>'QED vacuum'<b8_0/> to distinguish it from the <a3_0>vacuum of quantum chromodynamics,<a3_0/> denoted as QCD vacuum. <a1_0><b5_0>QED<a1_0/> vacuum<b5_0/> is a state with no matter particles (hence the name), and also no photons. As described above, this state is impossible to achieve experimentally. (Even if <b7_0>every matter particle<b7_0/> could somehow be removed from a volume, it would be <a2_0><b6_0>impossible to eliminate all the blackbody photons<b6_0/><a2_0/>.) Nonetheless, it provides a good model for realizable vacuum, and agrees with a number of experimental observations as described next."}
