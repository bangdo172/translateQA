They come in two types: <a0_0><b5_0>hot cathode and cold cathode<b5_0/>.<a0_0/> In the hot cathode version an electrically heated filament produces <b6_0>an electron beam<b6_0/>. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize <b7_0>gas molecules<b7_0/> around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on <a1_0>the pressure in the gauge<a1_0/>. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10\u22123 torr to 10\u221210 torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. <a2_0>Cold cathode gauges<a2_0/> are accurate <b8_0>from 10\u22122 torr to 10\u22129 torr<b8_0/>. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The <a4_0>composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be <b9_0>unpredictable<b9_0/><a4_0/>, so a <a3_0>mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge<a3_0/> for accurate measurement."}
