All materials, solid or liquid, have a small vapour pressure, and their outgassing becomes important when the <a1_0>vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure<a1_0/>. In man-made systems, outgassing has the same effect as <b3_0>a leak<b3_0/> and can limit the achievable <b4_0>vacuum<b4_0/>. Outgassing products may condense on <b5_0>nearby colder surfaces<b5_0/>, which can be troublesome if they <a2_0>obscure optical instruments<a2_0/> or react with other materials.
