Vacuum is primarily measured <b6_0>by <a1_0>its absolute pressure<b6_0/><a1_0/>, but a complete characterization requires further parameters, such as <b7_0>temperature and chemical composition<b7_0/>. One of the most important parameters is the mean free path (MFP) of residual gases, which indicates the <a2_0>average distance that molecules will travel between collisions with each other.<a2_0/> As the gas density decreases, the MFP increases, and when the MFP is longer than the chamber, pump, spacecraft, or other objects present, the continuum assumptions of fluid mechanics do not apply. This vacuum state is called high vacuum, and the <a3_0>study of fluid flows<a3_0/> in this regime is called <b8_0>particle gas dynamics<b8_0/>. The MFP of air at atmospheric pressure is very short, 70 nm, but at 100 mPa (~6997100000000000000\u26601\u00d710\u22123 Torr) the MFP of room temperature air is roughly 100 mm, which is on the order of everyday objects such as vacuum tubes. The Crookes radiometer turns when the MFP is larger than the size of the vanes."}
