A torr is equal to <b4_0>the <a1_0>displacement of a millimeter of <b5_0>mercury<b5_0/><b4_0/><a1_0/> (mmHg) in a manometer with 1 torr equaling <b6_0>133.3223684<b6_0/> pascals above absolute zero pressure. Vacuum is often also measured on the <a2_0><b7_0>barometric scale<b7_0/><a2_0/> or as a percentage of atmospheric pressure in bars or atmospheres. Low vacuum is often measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or pascals (Pa) below standard atmospheric pressure. <a0_0>\"Below atmospheric\"<a0_0/> means that the absolute pressure is equal to the current atmospheric pressure."}
