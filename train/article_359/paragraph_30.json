Suction can spread and dilute <b1_0>a vacuum<b1_0/> by letting a higher pressure push fluids into it, but the vacuum has to be created first before suction can occur. The easiest way to create an artificial vacuum is to expand the volume of a container. For example, the diaphragm muscle expands the chest cavity, which causes the volume of the lungs to increase. This expansion reduces the pressure and creates a partial vacuum, which is soon filled by <b2_0><b3_0>air<b3_0/><b2_0/> pushed in by atmospheric pressure."}
