Following Plato, even the abstract concept of a featureless void faced considerable skepticism: it could not be apprehended by <b7_0>the senses<b7_0/>, it could not, itself, provide additional explanatory power beyond the physical volume with which it was commensurate and, by definition, it was quite literally nothing at all, which <a2_0>cannot rightly be said to <b8_0>exist<b8_0/><a2_0/>. Aristotle believed that <a0_0><b4_0>no void<b4_0/> could occur naturally,<a0_0/> because the <a3_0>denser surrounding material continuum<a3_0/> would immediately fill any incipient rarity that might give rise to a void."}
