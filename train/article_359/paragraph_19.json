The reduction in pressure lowers the temperature at which blood and other body fluids boil, but the elastic pressure of blood vessels ensures that this boiling point remains above the internal body temperature of <b4_0>37 \u00b0C<b4_0/>. Although the blood will not boil, the formation of <b6_0>gas bubbles<b6_0/> in bodily fluids at reduced pressures, known as ebullism, is still a concern. The gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but <a3_0>tissues are elastic and porous<a3_0/> enough to prevent rupture. Swelling and <a2_0>ebullism<a2_0/> can be restrained by containment in <b7_0>a flight suit<b7_0/>. Shuttle astronauts wore a fitted elastic garment called <a1_0>the Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS)<a1_0/> which prevents ebullism at pressures as low as <b8_0>2 kPa (15 Torr)<b8_0/>. Rapid boiling will cool the skin and create frost, particularly in the mouth, but this is not a significant hazard."}
