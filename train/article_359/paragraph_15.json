The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube. The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube, one side of which is connected to the region of interest. Any fluid can be used, but mercury is preferred for <a0_0>its high density and low vapour pressure<a0_0/>. Simple hydrostatic gauges can <a2_0>measure pressures ranging from <b8_0>1 torr (100 Pa)<b8_0/> to above atmospheric<a2_0/>. An important variation is <b7_0>the McLeod gauge<b7_0/> which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge <a3_0>can measure vacuums as high as <b6_0>10\u22126 torr<a3_0/> (0.1 mPa)<b6_0/>, which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties. These <b9_0>indirect measurements<b9_0/> must be calibrated via <b5_0>a direct measurement<b5_0/>, most commonly a <a4_0>McLeod gauge<a4_0/>."}
