The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in <a2_0>the late 11th century<a2_0/> but the majority of the mosaics are works of <a3_0>local artists<a3_0/> from the 12th\u201313th centuries. The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century. One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark's were based directly on the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis, a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople (<a4_0>1204<a4_0/>). The mosaics were executed in the 1220s."}
