The Abbey of Saint-Martial in <a1_0>Limoges<a1_0/>, originally an important place of pilgrimage, was totally demolished during the French Revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in <a2_0>the 1960s<a2_0/>. A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century. It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble, probably taken from antique pavements. This could also be the case with the early <a3_0>9th century mosaic<a3_0/> found under the Basilica of Saint-Quentin in Picardy, where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors. The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at Lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique <a4_0>simple colors<a4_0/>. More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at Poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century."}
