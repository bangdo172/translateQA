Rather than being assembled by hand, mosaics designed using computer aided design (<a1_0>CAD<a1_0/>) software can be assembled by a robot. Production can be greater than <a2_0>10 times faster<a2_0/> with higher accuracy. But these \"computer\" mosaics have a <a4_0>different look<a4_0/> than hand-made \"artisanal\" mosaics. With robotic production, colored tiles are loaded into buffers, and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to <a3_0>a command file<a3_0/> from the design software."}
