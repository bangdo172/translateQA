It depicted <a2_0>St. Peter<a2_0/> walking on the waters. This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter's in <a3_0>the 17th<a3_0/> century. Navicella means <a4_0>\"little ship\"<a4_0/> referring to the large boat which dominated the scene, and whose sail, filled by the storm, loomed over the horizon. Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art."}
