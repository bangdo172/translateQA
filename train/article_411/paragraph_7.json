The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived, but the mosaics of Santa Constanza and <a1_0>Santa Pudenziana<a1_0/>, both from the 4th century, still exist. The winemaking putti in the ambulatory of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of Bacchus, which symbolizes transformation or change, and are thus appropriate for <a2_0>a mausoleum<a2_0/>, the original function of this building. In another great <a4_0>Constantinian<a4_0/> basilica, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved. The so-called Tomb of the Julii, near the crypt beneath <a3_0>St Peter's Basilica<a3_0/>, is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations. The Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki, converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century, was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics. Only fragments survive of the original decoration, especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies."}
