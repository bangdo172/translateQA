In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found <a1_0>in the ancient harbour area<a1_0/>. Its mosaic floor depicts <a2_0>King David as Orpheus<a2_0/>, identified by his name in Hebrew letters. Near him were lion cubs, a giraffe and a snake listening to him <a3_0>playing a lyre<a3_0/>. A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves, each of which contains an animal: a lioness suckling her cub, a giraffe, peacocks, panthers, bears, a zebra and so on. The floor was paved <a4_0>in 508/509<a4_0/>. It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon (Menois) and the Christian church at Shellal, suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places."}
