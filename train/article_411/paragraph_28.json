The Greek inscriptions, decorative patterns, and evangelists in the squinches are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on <a2_0>the Cappella Palatina<a2_0/>. The mosaic depicting <a4_0>Roger II<a4_0/> of Sicily, dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ, was originally in the demolished narthex together with another panel, the Theotokos with <a3_0>Georgios of Antiochia<a3_0/>, the founder of the church."}
