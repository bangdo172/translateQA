Although <a1_0>some vandal<a1_0/> systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern. Many details are similar to the <a4_0>Pammakaristos<a4_0/> mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings. Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the Theotokos Paregoritissa Church in <a2_0>Arta<a2_0/>. The church was established by <a3_0>the Despot of Epirus<a3_0/> in 1294\u201396. In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator, with prophets and cherubim below."}
