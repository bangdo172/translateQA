The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city. The most important is the so-called \"Armenian Mosaic\" which was discovered in <a2_0>1894<a2_0/> on the Street of the Prophets <a1_0>near Damascus Gate<a1_0/>. It depicts <a4_0>a vine with many branches<a4_0/> and grape clusters, which springs from a vase. Populating the vine's branches are peacocks, ducks, storks, pigeons, an eagle, a partridge, and a parrot in a cage. The inscription reads: \"For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows.\" Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small, natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries. The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a <a3_0>mortuary chapel<a3_0/>."}
