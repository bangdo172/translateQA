Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except <a1_0>three<a1_0/> panels, the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after <a2_0>the Hagia Sophia<a2_0/>. They were executed around 1320 by the command of <a3_0>Theodore Metochites<a3_0/>. The esonarthex has two fluted domes, specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ. The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos. The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge turban, offering the model of the church to Christ. The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ. These panels show the influence of the <a4_0>Italian trecento<a4_0/> on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings, landscapes, figures."}
