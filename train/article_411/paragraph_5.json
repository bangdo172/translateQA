The large villa rustica, which was probably owned by <a1_0>Emperor Maximian<a1_0/>, was built largely in the early 4th century. The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by <a2_0>a landslide<a2_0/> that occurred in the 12th Century. The most important pieces are the Circus Scene, the <a3_0>64m<a3_0/> long Great Hunting Scene, the Little Hunt, the Labours of Hercules and the famous Bikini Girls, showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century bikinis. The peristyle, the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics. Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the <a4_0>Piazza Vittoria in Palermo<a4_0/> where two houses were discovered. The most important scenes there depicted Orpheus, Alexander the Great's Hunt and the Four Seasons."}
