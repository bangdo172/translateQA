The tiny tesserae allowed <a1_0>very fine detail<a1_0/>, and an approach to the illusionism of painting. Often small panels called <a2_0>emblemata<a2_0/> were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work. The normal technique was <a3_0>opus tessellatum<a3_0/>, using larger tesserae, which was laid on site. There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background, which was no doubt <a4_0>cheaper than fully coloured work<a4_0/>."}
