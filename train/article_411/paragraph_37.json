Almost nothing of them survived except the <a2_0>\"Ascension of Christ\"<a2_0/> <a3_0>in the Latin Chapel<a3_0/> (now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics). More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ, Councils of the Church and angels. In the apses the Annunciation, the Nativity, Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen. The program of redecoration of the church was completed in <a4_0>1169<a4_0/> as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor, the king of Jerusalem and the Latin Church."}
