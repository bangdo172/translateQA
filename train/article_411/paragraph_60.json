Tiles are applied <a0_0>face-down to a backing paper<a0_0/> using an adhesive, and later transferred onto walls, floors or craft projects. This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it <a1_0>gives the maker time to rework<a1_0/> areas, allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front, even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses. Mosaic <a3_0>murals<a3_0/>, benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using <a2_0>the indirect method<a2_0/>, as it results in a smoother and more even surface."}
