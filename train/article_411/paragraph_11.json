The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures, birds, terrestrial beasts, fruits, flowers, trees and abstracts \u2013 designed to depict <a3_0>a terrestrial paradise<a3_0/> of God\u2019s creation. Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets, tabulae ansatae, carrying inscriptions. A variety of fish, a crab, a lobster, shrimps, mushrooms, flowers, a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions, which reads: In fulfilment of the vow (<a2_0>prayer<a2_0/>) of those whose names God knows. This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors\u2019 humility and an acknowledgement of God\u2019s omniscience."}
