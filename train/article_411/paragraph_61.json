The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium (often adhesive-backed paper, <a4_0>sticky plastic<a4_0/> or soft lime or putty) as it will appear when installed. When the mosaic is complete, a similar medium is placed atop it. The piece is then turned over, the original underlying material is carefully removed, and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above. In comparison to the indirect method, this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator, to avoid damaging the work. Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator <a1_0>directly controlling the final result of the work<a1_0/>, which is important e.g. when the human figure is involved. This method was created in <a2_0>1989<a2_0/> by <a3_0>Maurizio Placuzzi<a3_0/> and registered for industrial use (patent n. 0000222556) under the name of his company, Sicis International Srl, now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl."}
