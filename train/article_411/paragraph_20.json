The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of <a1_0>prophets, saints and patriarchs<a1_0/>. Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an Emperor kneeling before Christ (late 9th or early 10th century). Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine. Justinian I is offering the model of the church to Mary while Constantine is holding a model of the city in his hand. Both emperors are beardless \u2013 this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded. A mosaic panel on the gallery shows Christ with <a4_0>Constantine Monomachos<a4_0/> and Empress Zoe (1042\u2013<a2_0>1055<a2_0/>). The emperor gives <a3_0>a bulging money sack<a3_0/> to Christ as a donation for the church."}
