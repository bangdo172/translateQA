Feynman followed <a2_0><b7_0>Hans Bethe<b7_0/><a2_0/>, instead, to <a1_0><b6_0>Cornell University<b6_0/><a1_0/>, where Feynman taught theoretical physics from 1945 to 1950. During a temporary depression following the <a3_0><b8_0>destruction of Hiroshima by the bomb<b8_0/><a3_0/> produced by the Manhattan Project, he focused on complex physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these was analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating dish as it is moving through the air. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, proved important to his <a4_0><b9_0>Nobel Prize\u2013winning work<b9_0/><a4_0/>, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities."}
