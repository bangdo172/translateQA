Upon starting high school, Feynman was quickly promoted into a higher math class. An unspecified school-administered IQ test estimated his IQ at <a0_0><b5_0>123<b5_0/><a0_0/>\u2014high, but \"merely respectable\" according to biographer James Gleick. When he turned <a2_0><b7_0>15<b7_0/><a2_0/>, he taught himself trigonometry, advanced algebra, infinite series, analytic geometry, and both differential and integral calculus. In high school he was developing the mathematical intuition behind his Taylor series of mathematical operators. Before entering college, he was experimenting with and deriving mathematical topics such as the <a3_0><b8_0>half-derivative<b8_0/><a3_0/> using his own notation."}
