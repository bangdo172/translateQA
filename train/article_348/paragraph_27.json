Later <a3_0><b8_0>Feynman's daughter Michelle<b8_0/><a3_0/> would realize this journey. Out of his enthusiastic interest in reaching Tuva came the phrase \"Tuva or Bust\" (also the title of a book about his efforts to get there), which was tossed about frequently amongst his circle of friends in hope that they, one day, could see it firsthand. The documentary movie, <a4_0><b9_0>Genghis Blues<b9_0/><a4_0/>, mentions some of his attempts to communicate with Tuva and chronicles the successful journey there by his friends. Responding to Hubert Humphrey's congratulation for his Nobel Prize, Feynman admitted to a long admiration for the then vice president."}
