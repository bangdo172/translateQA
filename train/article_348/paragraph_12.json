The appointment was spent on leave for his involvement in the <a3_0>Manhattan project<a3_0/>. In 1945, he received a letter from <a1_0><b5_0>Dean Mark Ingraham<b5_0/><a1_0/> of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to UW to teach in the coming academic year. His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to return. In a talk given several years later at UW, Feynman quipped, \"It's great to be back at the only university that ever had the good sense to fire me.\""}
