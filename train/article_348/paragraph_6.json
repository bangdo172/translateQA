Attendees at Feynman's first seminar included Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, and John von Neumann. He received a PhD from Princeton in <a3_0><b8_0>1942<b8_0/><a3_0/>; his thesis advisor was John Archibald Wheeler. Feynman's thesis applied the principle of stationary action to problems of quantum mechanics, inspired by a desire to quantize the Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, laying the groundwork for the \"path integral\" approach and Feynman diagrams, and was titled \"<a4_0><b9_0>The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics<b9_0/><a4_0/>\"."}
