The world-lines of the diagrams have developed to become <a1_0><b5_0>tubes<b5_0/><a1_0/> to allow better modeling of more complicated objects such as strings and membranes. Shortly before his death, Feynman criticized string theory in an interview: \"I don't like that they're not calculating anything,\" he said. \"I don't like that <a2_0><b6_0>they don't check their ideas<b6_0/><a2_0/>.
