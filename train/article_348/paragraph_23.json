Feynman's account reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of <a2_0>NASA<a2_0/>'s high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, <b7_0>NASA managers<b7_0/> claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to <a3_0>1 in 200<a3_0/>.

He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), \"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.\""}
