He gained a reputation for taking great care when giving explanations to his students and for making it a moral duty to make the topic accessible. His guiding principle was that, if a topic could not be explained in a freshman lecture, it was not yet <a1_0>fully understood<a1_0/>. Feynman gained great pleasure from coming up with such a \"freshman-level\" explanation, for example, of the connection between spin and statistics. What he said was that groups of <b7_0>particles<b7_0/> with spin \u00bd \"repel\", whereas groups with integer spin \"clump\". This was a brilliantly simplified way of demonstrating how Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics evolved as a consequence of studying how fermions and bosons behave under a rotation of 360\u00b0. This was also a question he pondered in his more advanced lectures, and to which he demonstrated the solution in the 1986 Dirac memorial lecture. In the same lecture, he further explained that <a2_0><b5_0>antiparticles<b5_0/><a2_0/> must exist, for if particles had only positive energies, they would not be restricted to a so-called \"<a3_0>light cone<a3_0/>\"."}
