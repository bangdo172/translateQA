For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with <a1_0><b6_0>Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga<b6_0/><a1_0/>, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in <a2_0><b7_0>1965<b7_0/><a2_0/>. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as <a3_0><b8_0>Feynman diagrams<b8_0/><a3_0/>. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was <a4_0><b9_0>ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
