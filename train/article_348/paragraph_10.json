In Feynman's own words, \"There wasn't anything to do there.\" Bored, he indulged his curiosity by learning to pick the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers. Feynman played many jokes on colleagues. In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27\u201318\u201328 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), and found that the three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He <a1_0><b5_0>left a series of notes in the cabinets<b5_0/><a1_0/> as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or <a2_0><b6_0>saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets<b6_0/><a2_0/>. On several occasions, Feynman drove to <a3_0><b7_0>Albuquerque<b7_0/><a3_0/> to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from <b8_0>Klaus Fuchs<b8_0/>, who was later discovered to be a real <a4_0><b9_0>spy for the Soviets<b9_0/><a4_0/>, transporting nuclear secrets in his car to Santa Fe."}
