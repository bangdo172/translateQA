At this time in the early 1960s, Feynman exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time, including a request, while at Caltech, to \"spruce up\" the teaching of undergraduates. After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that eventually became <a1_0><b6_0>The Feynman Lectures on Physics<b6_0/><a1_0/>. He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book. Concerned over the <a2_0><b7_0>connections to drugs and rock and roll<b7_0/><a2_0/> that could be made from the image, the publishers changed the cover to plain red, though they included a picture of him playing <a3_0><b8_0>drums<b8_0/><a3_0/> in the foreword. The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists, Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, as part-time co-authors for several years. Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics. Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including <a4_0><b9_0>The Character of Physical Law, QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter<b9_0/><a4_0/>, Statistical Mechanics, Lectures on Gravitation, and the Feynman Lectures on Computation."}
