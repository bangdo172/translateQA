By the 1970s another issue had emerged affecting education for qualification and registration for practice as an architect, due to the obligation imposed on the United Kingdom and other European governments to comply with <a0_0><b6_0>European Union<b6_0/><a0_0/> Directives concerning mutual recognition of professional qualifications in favour of equal standards across borders, in furtherance of the policy for a single market of the European Union. This led to proposals for reconstituting ARCUK. Eventually, in the 1990s, before proceeding, the government issued a consultation paper \"Reform of Architects Registration\" (1994). The change of name to \"<a4_0><b8_0>Architects Registration Board<b8_0/><a4_0/>\" was one of the proposals which was later enacted in <a2_0>the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act<a2_0/> <a1_0><b5_0>1996<b5_0/><a1_0/> and reenacted as the Architects Act 1997; another was the abolition of <a3_0><b7_0>the ARCUK Board of Architectural Education<b7_0/><a3_0/>."}
