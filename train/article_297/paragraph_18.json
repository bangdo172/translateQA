The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate sovereign states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as <a0_0>the Commonwealth<a0_0/>, gathered pace after the Second World War. During the ministry of Clement Attlee, British India became the two independent dominions of <a1_0>India and Pakistan<a1_0/> in <b4_0><b7_0>1947<b7_0/><b4_0/>. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India, and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, but he remained King of Pakistan until his death and India recognised his new title of Head of the Commonwealth. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as <a2_0>Burma<a2_0/> in <b5_0>January<b5_0/> 1948, Palestine (divided between Israel and the Arab states) in <b6_0>May<b6_0/> 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in <a3_0><b8_0>1949<b8_0/><a3_0/>."}
