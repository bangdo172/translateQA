An infatuation with the already-married <b7_0>Australian<b7_0/> socialite <a0_0><b5_0>Sheila<b5_0/>, Lady Loughborough<a0_0/>, came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her. That year, he met for the first time since childhood <a1_0>Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon<a1_0/>, the youngest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. He became determined to marry her. She rejected his proposal <a2_0>twice<a2_0/>, in <b6_0>1921<b6_0/> and <b8_0>1922<b8_0/>, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family. In the words of Lady Elizabeth's mother, Albert would be \"made or marred\" by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him."}
