George VI and his wife resolved to stay in <a1_0>London<a1_0/>, despite German bombing raids. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle. The first German raid on London, on <b8_0>7<b8_0/> September 1940, killed about <a2_0><b7_0>one thousand<b7_0/> civilians<a2_0/>, mostly in the East End. On <b6_0>13<b6_0/> September, the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there. In defiance, the Queen famously declared: \"I am glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel we can look the East End in the face\". The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations as the rest of the country. They were subject to rationing restrictions, and U.S. First Lady <b4_0>Eleanor Roosevelt<b4_0/> remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace. In <b5_0>August <a3_0>1942<b5_0/><a3_0/>, the King's brother, Prince George, Duke of Kent, was killed on active service."}
