Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen <b4_0><b6_0>Victoria<b6_0/><b4_0/>, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been \"rather distressed\". Two days later, he wrote again: \"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her\". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good\". Consequently, he was baptised \"Albert Frederick Arthur George\" at <a3_0>St. Mary Magdalene's Church<a3_0/> near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of <a1_0>Queen Victoria<a1_0/>, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as \"<a2_0>Bertie<a2_0/>\". His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name \"may supplant the less favoured one\"."}
