The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister <a0_0>Neville Chamberlain<a0_0/>'s <b7_0>appeasement<b7_0/> of Hitler. However, when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the <a1_0><b5_0>Munich<b5_0/> Agreement<a1_0/> in <b4_0><b6_0>1938<b6_0/><b4_0/>, they invited him to appear on the balcony of <a2_0>Buckingham Palace<a2_0/> with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family. While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian <a3_0>John Grigg<a3_0/> to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as \"the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century\"."}
