Some of these kings were hereditary; other states elected their rulers. Early \"republics\" such as the Vajji (or Vriji) confederation centered in the city of <a0_0>Vaishali<a0_0/>, existed as early as the <a1_0>6th century BCE<a1_0/> and persisted in some areas until the <a2_0>4th century CE<a2_0/>. The educated speech at that time was <a3_0>Sanskrit<a3_0/>, while the languages of the general population of northern India are referred to as <a4_0>Prakrits<a4_0/>. Many of the sixteen kingdoms had coalesced to four major ones by 500/400 BCE, by the time of Gautama Buddha. These four were Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala, and Magadha. The Life of Gautam Budhha was mainly associated with these four kingdoms."}
