The White Huns established themselves in modern-day <a2_0>Afghanistan<a2_0/> by the first half of the 5th century. Led by the Hun military leader Toramana, they overran the northern region of <a3_0>Pakistan and North India<a3_0/>. Toramana's son Mihirakula, a Saivite Hindu, moved up to near Pataliputra to the east and Gwalior to the central India. Hiuen Tsiang narrates Mihirakula's merciless persecution of Buddhists and destruction of monasteries, though the description is disputed as far as the authenticity is concerned. The Huns were defeated by the Indian kings Yasodharman of Malwa and Narasimhagupta in the 6th century. Some of them were driven out of India and others were assimilated in the Indian society."}
