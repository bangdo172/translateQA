During the Mughal era, the dominant political forces consisted of the Mughal Empire and its tributaries and, later on, the rising successor states \u2013 including the Maratha Empire \u2013 which fought an increasingly weak Mughal dynasty. The Mughals, while often employing brutal tactics to subjugate their empire, had a policy of <a1_0>integration with Indian culture<a1_0/>, which is what made them successful where the short-lived Sultanates of Delhi had failed. This period marked vast social change in the subcontinent as the Hindu majority were ruled over by the Mughal emperors, most of whom showed religious tolerance, liberally patronising Hindu culture. The famous <a2_0>emperor Akbar<a2_0/>, who was the grandson of Babar, tried to establish a good relationship with the Hindus. However, later emperors such as <a3_0>Aurangazeb<a3_0/> tried to establish complete Muslim dominance, and as a result several historical temples were destroyed during this period and taxes imposed on non-Muslims. Akbar declared \"Amari\" or non-killing of animals in the holy days of Jainism. He rolled back the jizya tax for non-Muslims. The Mughal emperors married local royalty, allied themselves with local maharajas, and attempted to fuse their Turko-Persian culture with <a4_0>ancient Indian<a4_0/> styles, creating a unique Indo-Saracenic architecture. It was the erosion of this tradition coupled with increased brutality and centralization that played a large part in the dynasty's downfall after Aurangzeb, who unlike previous emperors, imposed relatively non-pluralistic policies on the general population, which often inflamed the majority Hindu population."}
