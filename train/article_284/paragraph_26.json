The territory of the empire covered much of India from 230 BCE onward. S\u0101tav\u0101hanas started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty, but declared independence with its decline. They are known for their patronage of <a1_0>Hinduism and Buddhism<a1_0/> which resulted in Buddhist monuments from Ellora (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) to Amaravati. The S\u0101tav\u0101hanas were one of the first Indian states to issue <a2_0>coins<a2_0/> struck with their rulers embossed. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade as well as the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the southern tip of India. They had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynasty of Magadha to establish their rule. Later, they played a crucial role to protect a huge part of India against <a4_0>foreign invaders<a4_0/> like the Sakas, Yavanas and Pahlavas. In particular their struggles with the Western Kshatrapas went on for a long time. The notable rulers of the Satavahana Dynasty Gautamiputra Satakarni and Sri Yajna S\u0101takarni were able to defeat the foreign invaders like the Western Kshatrapas and to stop their expansion. In the <a3_0>3rd century CE<a3_0/> the empire was split into smaller states."}
