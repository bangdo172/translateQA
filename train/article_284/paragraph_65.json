The Company soon expanded its territories around its bases in Bombay and Madras; the Anglo-Mysore Wars (<a1_0>1766\u20131799<a1_0/>) and later the Anglo-Maratha Wars (<a2_0>1772\u20131818<a2_0/>) led to control of the vast regions of India. Ahom Kingdom of North-east India first fell to Burmese invasion and then to British after Treaty of Yandabo in 1826. Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir were annexed after the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849; however, Kashmir was immediately sold under the Treaty of Amritsar to the <a3_0>Dogra Dynasty of Jammu<a3_0/> and thereby became a <a4_0>princely state<a4_0/>. The border dispute between Nepal and British India, which sharpened after 1801, had caused the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814\u201316 and brought the defeated Gurkhas under British influence. In 1854, Berar was annexed, and the state of Oudh was added two years later."}
