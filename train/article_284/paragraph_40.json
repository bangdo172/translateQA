Founded by <a4_0>Gopala I<a4_0/>, it was ruled by a <a1_0>Buddhist<a1_0/> dynasty from Bengal in the eastern region of the Indian subcontinent. Though the Palas were followers of the Mahayana and Tantric schools of Buddhism, they also patronised Shaivism and Vaishnavism. The morpheme Pala, meaning \"protector\", was used as an ending for the names of all the Pala monarchs. The empire reached its peak under Dharmapala and Devapala. Dharmapala is believed to have conquered Kanauj and extended his sway up to the farthest limits of India in the northwest. The Pala Empire can be considered as the <a2_0>golden era of Bengal<a2_0/> in many ways. Dharmapala founded the Vikramashila and revived Nalanda, considered one of the first great universities in recorded history. <a3_0>Nalanda<a3_0/> reached its height under the patronage of the Pala Empire. The Palas also built many viharas. They maintained close cultural and commercial ties with countries of Southeast Asia and Tibet. Sea trade added greatly to the prosperity of the Pala kingdom. The Arab merchant Suleiman notes the enormity of the Pala army in his memoirs."}
