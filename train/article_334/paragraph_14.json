Scholars like Arnold H. Green and Seyyed Hossein Nasr have argued that starting in the <a0_0><b4_0>10th century<b4_0/><a0_0/>, some medieval Islamic madaris indeed became universities. <a3_0><b8_0>George Makdisi<b8_0/><a3_0/> and others, however, argue that the European university has no parallel in the medieval Islamic world. Darleen Pryds questions this view, pointing out that madaris and European universities in the Mediterranean region shared similar foundations by <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0>princely patrons<b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/> and were intended to provide loyal administrators to <a2_0><b7_0>further the rulers' agenda<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Other scholars regard the university as uniquely European in origin and characteristics."}
