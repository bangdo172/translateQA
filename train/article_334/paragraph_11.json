The ij\u0101zat al-tadr\u012bs wa-al-ift\u0101\u02bc (\"licence to teach and issue legal opinions\") in the medieval Islamic legal education system had its origins in the <a1_0><b5_0>9th century<b5_0/><a1_0/> after the formation of the madh\u0101hib (schools of jurisprudence). George Makdisi considers the ij\u0101zah to be the origin of the <a3_0><b7_0>European doctorate<b7_0/><a3_0/>. However, in an earlier article, he considered the ij\u0101zah to be of \"fundamental difference\" to the medieval doctorate, since the former was awarded by an individual teacher-scholar not obliged to follow any formal criteria, whereas the latter was conferred on the student by the collective authority of the faculty. To obtain an ij\u0101zah, a student \"had to study in a guild school of law, usually <b6_0>four years<b6_0/> for the basic undergraduate course\" and <a2_0>ten or more years<a2_0/> for a post-graduate course. The \"doctorate was obtained after an oral examination to determine the originality of the candidate's theses\", and to test the student's \"ability to defend them against all objections, in disputations set up for the purpose.\" These were scholarly exercises practised throughout the student's \"career as a graduate student of law.\" After students completed their post-graduate education, they were awarded ijazas giving them the status of faq\u012bh 'scholar of jurisprudence', muft\u012b 'scholar competent in issuing fatw\u0101s', and mudarris 'teacher'."}
