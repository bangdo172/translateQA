According to Makdisi, the Latin title <a3_0><b7_0>licentia docendi<b7_0/><a3_0/> '<a0_0><b4_0>licence to teach<b4_0/><a0_0/>' in the European university may have been a translation of the Arabic, but the underlying concept was very different. A significant difference between the ij\u0101zat al-tadr\u012bs and the <b8_0>licentia docendi<b8_0/> was that the former was awarded by the <a1_0>individual scholar-teacher<a1_0/>, while the latter was awarded by the <a2_0><b6_0>chief official of the university<b6_0/><a2_0/>, who represented the collective faculty, rather than the <b5_0>individual scholar-teacher<b5_0/>."}
