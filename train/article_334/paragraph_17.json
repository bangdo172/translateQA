In madaris, the ij\u0101zahs were only issued in one field, the <a0_0><b5_0>Islamic religious law of shar\u012b\u02bbah<b5_0/><a0_0/>, and in no other field of learning. Other academic subjects, including the natural sciences, philosophy and literary studies, were only treated \"ancillary\" to the study of the Sharia. For example, a natural science like astronomy was only studied (if at all) to <a1_0><b6_0>supply religious needs<b6_0/><a1_0/>, like the time for prayer. This is why <a3_0><b8_0>Ptolemaic astronomy<b8_0/><a3_0/> was considered adequate, and is still taught in some modern day madaris. The Islamic law undergraduate degree from <a4_0><b9_0>al-Azhar<b9_0/><a4_0/>, the most prestigious madrasa, was traditionally granted without final examinations, but on the basis of the students' attentive attendance to courses. In contrast to the medieval doctorate which was granted by the collective <b7_0>authority of the faculty<b7_0/>, the Islamic degree was not granted by <a2_0>the teacher<a2_0/> to the pupil based on any formal criteria, but remained a \"personal matter, the sole prerogative of the person bestowing it; no one could force him to give one\"."}
