Medreses were built in as part of a Mosque complex where many programmes, such as <a0_0><b4_0>aid to the poor<b4_0/> through soup kitchens<a0_0/>, were held under the infrastructure of a mosque, which reveals the interconnectedness of <b5_0>religion<b5_0/> and social life during this period. \"The mosques to which medreses were attached, dominated the social life in Ottoman cities.\" Social life was not dominated by <a1_0>religion<a1_0/> only in the Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire; it was also quite similar to the social life of Europe during this period. As Goffman says: \"Just as mosques dominated social life for the Ottomans, churches and synagogues dominated life for the Christians and Jews as well.\" Hence, social life and the medrese were closely linked, since <b6_0>medreses<b6_0/> taught many curricula, such as religion, which highly governed social life in terms of establishing orthodoxy. \"They tried moving their developing state toward <a3_0><b7_0>Islamic orthodoxy<b7_0/><a3_0/>.\" Overall, the fact that mosques contained medreses comes to show the relevance of education to religion in the sense that education took place within the framework of religion and religion established social life by trying to create a common religious orthodoxy. Hence, <a2_0>medreses<a2_0/> were simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values and beliefs."}
