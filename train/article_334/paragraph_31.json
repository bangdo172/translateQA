There are <a0_0><b4_0>six<b4_0/><a0_0/> Madrasahs in Singapore, catering to students from Primary 1 to Secondary 4. Four Madrasahs are coeducational and two are for girls. Students take a range of Islamic Studies subjects in addition to mainstream MOE curriculum subjects and sit for the PSLE and GCE 'O' Levels like their peers. In 2009, MUIS introduced the \"Joint Madrasah System\" (JMS), a joint collaboration of Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah primary school and secondary schools Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah (offering the ukhrawi, or religious stream) and Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah (offering the academic stream). The JMS aims to introduce the <a1_0><b5_0>International Baccalaureate<b5_0/><a1_0/> (IB) programme into the Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah by <a2_0><b6_0>2019<b6_0/><a2_0/>. Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including <a3_0>the <b7_0>songkok for boys and tudong for girls<b7_0/><a3_0/>, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state. For students who wish to attend a mainstream school, they may opt to take classes on weekends at the madrasah instead of enrolling full-time."}
