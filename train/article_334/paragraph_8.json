Like madaris (which referred to higher education), a maktab was often attached to an endowed mosque.

He wrote that children can learn better if taught in <a3_0>classes<a3_0/> instead of individual tuition from <b8_0>private tutors<b8_0/>, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of <b9_0>competition and emulation<b9_0/> among pupils, as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 described the curriculum of a maktab school in some detail, describing the curricula for <a4_0>two<a4_0/> stages of education in a maktab school."}
