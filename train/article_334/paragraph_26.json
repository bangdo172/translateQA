As \u0130nalc\u0131k mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\" However, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" \u2013 key word being \"divine\". \u0130nalc\u0131k also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to <a1_0><b6_0>confirm the doctrines of <b8_0>Islam<b8_0/><b6_0/><a1_0/>.\" Hence, madaris \u2013 schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a <a2_0><b7_0>pluralistic<b7_0/><a2_0/> society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around <a3_0>Islam<a3_0/>. Similarly, in Europe \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\" Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach \"proper religious values.\" This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools in the sense that they offered a <a4_0><b9_0>wide range of studies<b9_0/><a4_0/>; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories."}
