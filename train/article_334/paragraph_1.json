Therefore, madrasah literally means \"<a1_0>a place where learning and studying take place<a1_0/>\". The word is also present as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as: Urdu, Bengali, Hindi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Malay and Bosnian / Croatian. In the Arabic language, the word \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629 madrasah simply means the <a2_0>same as <b7_0>school<b7_0/> does in the English language<a2_0/>, whether that is private, public or parochial school, as well as for any primary or secondary school whether Muslim, non-Muslim, or secular. Unlike the use of the word school in British English, the word madrasah more closely resembles the term school in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire during the Early Modern Period, madaris had <a3_0><b8_0>lower schools and specialised<a3_0/> schools<b8_0/> where the students became known as <a4_0><b9_0>dani\u015fmends<b9_0/><a4_0/>. The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0629 (j\u0101mi\u02bbah). The Hebrew cognate midrasha also connotes the meaning of a place of learning; the related term midrash literally refers to study or learning, but has acquired mystical and religious connotations."}
