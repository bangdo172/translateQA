Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the <a1_0>Soviet Union<a1_0/>, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of <a2_0>recapturing the Suez Canal<a2_0/>. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to <a3_0>surrender<a3_0/>. Following Nasser's acceptance, Israel agreed to a ceasefire and Nasser used the lull in fighting to move <a4_0>SAM missiles<a4_0/> towards the canal zone."}
