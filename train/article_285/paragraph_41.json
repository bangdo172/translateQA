A third infantry battalion and hundreds of national guardsmen were sent to the city as reinforcements, while two regular companies were dispatched to organize popular resistance. Nasser and Boghdadi traveled to the canal zone to boost the morale of the armed volunteers.

When British and French forces landed in Port Said on 5\u20136 November, its local militia put up a stiff resistance, resulting in street-to-street fighting.
