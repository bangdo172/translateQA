Nasser was sent as a member of the Egyptian delegation to Rhodes in February 1949 to negotiate a formal armistice with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be <a3_0>humiliating<a3_0/>, particularly because the Israelis were able to easily occupy the <a4_0>Eilat<a4_0/> region while negotiating with the Arabs in March."}
