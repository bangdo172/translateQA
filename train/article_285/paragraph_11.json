Nasser returned to Sudan in September 1942 after a brief stay in Egypt, then secured a position as an <a1_0>instructor<a1_0/> in the Cairo Royal Military Academy in May 1943. In 1942, the <a2_0>British Ambassador Miles Lampson<a2_0/> marched into King Farouk's palace and ordered him to dismiss Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha for having pro-Axis sympathies. Nasser saw the incident as a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty and wrote, \"I am ashamed that our army has not reacted against this attack\", and wished for \"calamity\" to overtake the British. Nasser was accepted into the General Staff College later that year. He began to form a group of young military officers with strong <a3_0>nationalist<a3_0/> sentiments who supported some form of revolution. Nasser stayed in touch with the group's members primarily through <a4_0>Amer<a4_0/>, who continued to seek out interested officers within the Egyptian Armed Force's various branches and presented Nasser with a complete file on each of them."}
