Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: <a4_0>Boghdadi and Amer<a4_0/> in Egypt, and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria. Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev. At the meeting, <a2_0>Khrushchev<a2_0/> pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the <a3_0>Communist Party<a3_0/>, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the UAR's affairs. The matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries."}
