Nasser did not believe that a low-ranking officer like himself (a lieutenant colonel) would be accepted by the Egyptian people, and so selected <a1_0>General Naguib<a1_0/> to be his \"boss\" and lead the coup in name. The revolution they had long sought was launched on <a4_0>22 July<a4_0/> and was declared a success the next day. The Free Officers seized control of all government buildings, radio stations, and police stations, as well as army headquarters in Cairo. While many of the rebel officers were leading their units, Nasser donned <a3_0>civilian clothing<a3_0/> to avoid detection by royalists and moved around Cairo monitoring the situation. In a move to stave off foreign intervention two days before the revolution, Nasser had notified the American and British governments of his intentions, and both had agreed not to aid Farouk. Under pressure from the Americans, Nasser had agreed to <a2_0>exile<a2_0/> the deposed king with an honorary ceremony."}
