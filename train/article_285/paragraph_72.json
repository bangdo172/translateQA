A ceasefire in the Yemen War was declared and the summit concluded with the <a2_0>Khartoum Resolution<a2_0/>. The <a3_0>Soviet Union<a3_0/> soon resupplied the Egyptian military with about half of its former arsenals and broke diplomatic relations with Israel. Nasser cut relations with the US following the war, and, according to Aburish, his policy of \"playing the superpowers against each other\" ended. In November, Nasser accepted <a4_0>UN Resolution 242<a4_0/>, which called for Israel's withdrawal from territories acquired in the war. His supporters claimed Nasser's move was meant to buy time to prepare for another confrontation with Israel, while his detractors believed his acceptance of the resolution signaled a waning interest in Palestinian independence."}
