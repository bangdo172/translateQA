According to Kandil, without Nasser's authorization, Amer used the Soviet warnings as a pretext to <a1_0>dispatch troops to Sinai<a1_0/> on 14 May, and Nasser subsequently demanded UNEF's withdrawal. Earlier that day, Nasser received a warning from King Hussein of <a2_0>Israeli-American<a2_0/> collusion to drag Egypt into war. The message had been originally received by Amer on 2 May, but was withheld from Nasser until the Sinai deployment on 14 May. Although in the preceding months, Hussein and Nasser had been accusing each other of avoiding a fight with Israel, Hussein was nonetheless wary that an Egyptian-Israeli war would risk the <a3_0>West Bank<a3_0/>'s occupation by Israel. Nasser still felt that the US would restrain Israel from attacking due to assurances that he received from the <a4_0>US<a4_0/> and Soviet Union. In turn, he also reassured both powers that Egypt would only act defensively."}
