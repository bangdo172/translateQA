According to Aburish, after assuming power, Nasser and the Free Officers expected to become the \"guardians of the people's interests\" against the monarchy and the pasha class while leaving the day-to-day tasks of government to <a1_0>civilians<a1_0/>. They asked former prime minister <a2_0>Ali Maher<a2_0/> to accept reappointment to his previous position, and to form an all-civilian cabinet. The Free Officers then governed as the <a3_0>Revolutionary Command Council<a3_0/> (RCC) with Naguib as chairman and Nasser as vice-chairman. Relations between the RCC and Maher grew tense, however, as the latter viewed many of Nasser's schemes\u2014agrarian reform, abolition of the monarchy, reorganization of political parties\u2014as too radical, culminating in Maher's resignation on 7 September. Naguib assumed the additional role of prime minister, and Nasser that of deputy prime minister. In September, the <a4_0>Agrarian Reform Law<a4_0/> was put into effect. In Nasser's eyes, this law gave the RCC its own identity and transformed the coup into a revolution."}
