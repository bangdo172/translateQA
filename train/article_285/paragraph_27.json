Both Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez, the leading Arab <a2_0>singers<a2_0/> of the era, performed songs praising Nasser's nationalism. Others produced plays denigrating his political opponents. According to his associates, Nasser orchestrated the campaign himself. Arab nationalist terms such <a3_0>\"Arab homeland\" and \"Arab nation\"<a3_0/> frequently began appearing in his speeches in 1954\u201355, whereas prior he would refer to the Arab \"peoples\" or the \"Arab region\".
