The popularity of this move, as well as that of government-sponsored guerrilla attacks against the British, put pressure on Nasser to act. According to Sadat, Nasser decided to wage \"a large scale assassination campaign\". In January 1952, he and <a2_0>Hassan Ibrahim<a2_0/> attempted to kill the <a3_0>royalist<a3_0/> general <a1_0>Hussein Sirri Amer<a1_0/> by firing their submachine guns at his car as he drove through the streets of Cairo. Instead of killing the general, the attackers wounded <a4_0>an innocent female passerby<a4_0/>. Nasser recalled that her wails \"haunted\" him and firmly dissuaded him from undertaking similar actions in the future."}
