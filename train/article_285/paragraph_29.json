Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact a threat to his efforts to eliminate British military influence in the Middle East, and a mechanism to undermine the Arab League and \"perpetuate [Arab] subservience to Zionism and [Western] imperialism\". Nasser felt that if he was to maintain Egypt's regional leadership position he needed to acquire <a1_0>modern weaponry<a1_0/> to arm his military. When it became apparent to him that Western countries would not supply Egypt under acceptable financial and military terms, Nasser turned to the Eastern Bloc and concluded a <a3_0>US$320,000,000<a3_0/> armaments agreement with <a2_0>Czechoslovakia<a2_0/> on 27 September. Through the Czechoslovakian arms deal, the balance of power between Egypt and Israel was more or less <a4_0>equalized<a4_0/> and Nasser's role as the Arab leader defying the West was enhanced."}
