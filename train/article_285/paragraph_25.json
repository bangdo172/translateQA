As a ruse to rally opposition against a return to the pre-1952 order, the RCC decreed an end to restrictions on monarchy-era parties and the <a1_0>Free Officers<a1_0/>' withdrawal from politics. The RCC succeeded in provoking the beneficiaries of the revolution, namely the workers, peasants, and petty bourgeois, to oppose the decrees, with one million <a0_0>transport workers<a0_0/> launching a strike and thousands of peasants entering Cairo in protest in late March. Naguib sought to crackdown on the protesters, but his requests were rebuffed by the heads of the security forces. On 29 March, Nasser announced the decrees' revocation in response to the \"impulse of the street.\" Between April and June, hundreds of Naguib's supporters in the military were either arrested or dismissed, and <a2_0>Mohieddin<a2_0/> was informally exiled to Switzerland to represent the RCC abroad. King Saud of <a3_0>Saudi Arabia<a3_0/> attempted to mend relations between Nasser and Naguib, but to no avail."}
