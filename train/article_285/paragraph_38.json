Nasser was aware that the canal's nationalization would instigate an international crisis and believed the prospect of military intervention by the two countries was 80 per cent likely. He believed, however, that the UK would not be able to intervene militarily for at least two months after the announcement, and dismissed Israeli action as \"impossible\". In early October, the <a2_0>UN Security Council<a2_0/> met on the matter of the canal's nationalization and adopted a resolution recognizing Egypt's right to control the canal as long as it continued to allow passage through it for foreign ships. According to Heikal, after this agreement, \"Nasser estimated that the danger of invasion had dropped to 10 per cent\". Shortly thereafter, however, the UK, France, and <a1_0>Israel<a1_0/> made a secret agreement to take over the Suez Canal, occupy the Suez Canal zone, and <a3_0>topple<a3_0/> Nasser."}
