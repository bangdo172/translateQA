Nasser did not feel that the Egyptian Army was ready for a confrontation and <a2_0>did not retaliate militarily<a2_0/>. His failure to respond to Israeli military action demonstrated the ineffectiveness of his armed forces and constituted <a3_0>a blow to his growing popularity<a3_0/>. Nasser subsequently ordered the tightening of the <a4_0>blockade on Israeli shipping<a4_0/> through the Straits of Tiran and restricted the use of airspace over the Gulf of Aqaba by Israeli aircraft in early September. The Israelis re-militarized the al-Auja Demilitarized Zone on the Egyptian border on 21 September."}
