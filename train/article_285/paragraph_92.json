Nasser is played by Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel's 1996 <a1_0>Nasser 56<a1_0/>. The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the <a2_0>Suez Crisis<a2_0/>. It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film to dramatize the role of a modern-day Arab leader. Together with the 1999 Syrian biopic <a3_0>Gamal Abdel Nasser<a3_0/>, the films marked the first biographical movies about contemporary public figures produced in the Arab world."}
