Nasser blamed Arab divisions for what he deemed \"the disastrous situation\". He discouraged Syria and Palestinian guerrillas from provoking the Israelis, conceding that he had no plans for war with Israel. During the summit, Nasser developed cordial relations with <a2_0>King Hussein<a2_0/>, and ties were mended with the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Morocco. In May, Nasser moved to formally share his leadership position over the Palestine issue by initiating the creation of the <a3_0>Palestine Liberation Organization<a3_0/> (PLO). In practice, Nasser used the PLO to wield control over the Palestinian fedayeen. Its head was to be <a4_0>Ahmad Shukeiri<a4_0/>, Nasser's personal nominee."}
