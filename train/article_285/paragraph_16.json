By then, the organization had expanded to around ninety members; according to Khaled Mohieddin, \"nobody knew all of them and where they belonged in the hierarchy except Nasser\". Nasser felt that the Free Officers were not ready to move against the government and, for <a4_0>nearly two years<a4_0/>, he did little beyond officer recruitment and underground news bulletins."}
