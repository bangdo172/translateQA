Nasser focused on his military career from then on, and had little contact with his family. At the academy, he met Abdel Hakim Amer and Anwar Sadat, both of whom became important aides during his presidency. After graduating from the academy in July 1938, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry, and posted to Mankabad. It was here that Nasser and his closest comrades, including <a2_0>Sadat and Amer<a2_0/>, first discussed their dissatisfaction at <a3_0>widespread corruption<a3_0/> in the country and their desire to topple the <a4_0>monarchy<a4_0/>. Sadat would later write that because of his \"energy, clear-thinking, and balanced judgement\", Nasser emerged as the group's natural leader."}
