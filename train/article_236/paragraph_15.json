When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, <a1_0><b10_0>contingency-in-itself<b10_0/><a1_0/> is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is '<a4_0><b13_0>false in itself<b13_0/><a4_0/>' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. <a3_0><b12_0>The necessary<b12_0/><a3_0/> is <a2_0><b11_0>the source of <b8_0>its own being<b8_0/> without borrowed existence<b11_0/><a2_0/>. It is what always exists."}
