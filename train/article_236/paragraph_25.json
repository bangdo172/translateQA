Avicenna grounds his psychology on <a0_0><b5_0>physiology<b5_0/><a0_0/>, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by <a2_0><b7_0>his understanding of perception<b7_0/><a2_0/>; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our <a3_0><b8_0>external senses<b8_0/><a3_0/>. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in <a4_0><b9_0>the physical body<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
