Furthermore, It is 'One' (wahid ahad) since there cannot be more than one 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' without differentia (fasl) to distinguish them from each other. Yet, to require differentia entails that they exist 'due-to-themselves' as well as 'due to what is other than themselves'; and this is contradictory. However, if no differentia distinguishes them from each other, then there is no sense in which these 'Existents' are not one and the same. Avicenna adds that the 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' has no genus (jins), nor <a1_0><b8_0>a definition<b8_0/><a1_0/> (hadd), nor <b5_0>a counterpart<b5_0/> (nadd), nor an opposite (did), and is detached (bari) from <b6_0>matter<b6_0/> (madda), quality (kayf), quantity (kam), place (ayn), situation (<a2_0><b9_0>wad<b9_0/><a2_0/>), and <a3_0><b10_0><b11_0>time<b11_0/><b10_0/><a3_0/> (waqt)."}
