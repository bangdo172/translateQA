However Anawati argues (following Ruska) that the de Anima is a fake by a Spanish author. Similarly <a1_0><b6_0>the Declaratio<b6_0/><a1_0/> is believed not to be actually by Avicenna. The third work (<a2_0><b7_0>The Book of Minerals<b7_0/><a2_0/>) is agreed to be Avicenna's writing, adapted from the Kitab al-Shifa (<a3_0><b8_0>Book of the Remedy<b8_0/><a3_0/>). Ibn Sina classified <a4_0><b9_0>minerals<b9_0/><a4_0/> into stones, fusible substances, sulfurs, and salts, building on the ideas of Aristotle and Jabir. The epistola de Re recta is somewhat less sceptical of alchemy; Anawati argues that it is by Avicenna, but written earlier in his career when he had not yet firmly decided that transmutation was impossible."}
