The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of <a3_0><b13_0>Nishapur<b13_0/><a3_0/> and Merv to the borders of Khorasan, seeking an opening for his talents. Qabus, the generous ruler of Tabaristan, himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Ibn Sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at Gorgan, near the Caspian Sea, Ibn Sina met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Ibn Sina lectured on logic and astronomy. Several of Ibn Sina's treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his <b9_0>Canon of Medicine<b9_0/> also dates from his stay in Hyrcania."}
