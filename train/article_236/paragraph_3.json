On the other hand, Dimitri Gutas along with Aisha Khan and <a4_0><b14_0>Jules J. Janssens<b14_0/><a4_0/> demonstrated that Avicenna was a <a2_0><b12_0>Sunni<a2_0/> Hanafi<b12_0/>. However, the 14th cenutry Shia faqih <a3_0><b13_0>Nurullah Shushtari<b13_0/><a3_0/> according to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, maintained that he was most likely a Twelver Shia. Conversely, Sharaf Khorasani, citing a rejection of an invitation of the <b9_0>Sunni Governor Sultan Mahmoud Ghazanavi<b9_0/> by <b8_0>Avicenna<b8_0/> to his court, believes that Avicenna was an Ismaili. Similar disagreements exist on the background of Avicenna's family, whereas some writers considered them Sunni, some more recent writers contested that they were Shia."}
