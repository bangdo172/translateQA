One important feature of his writing is that he considers <a1_0><b6_0>mathematical astronomy<b6_0/><a1_0/> as a separate discipline to astrology. He criticized <a2_0><b7_0>Aristotle<b7_0/><a2_0/>'s view of the stars receiving their light from the Sun, stating that the stars are self-luminous, and believed that the planets are also self-luminous. He claimed to have observed <a3_0><b8_0>Venus<b8_0/><a3_0/> as a spot on the Sun. This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, <a4_0><b9_0>below the Sun<b9_0/><a4_0/> in Ptolemaic cosmology, i.e. the sphere of Venus comes before the sphere of the Sun when moving out from the Earth in the prevailing geocentric model."}
