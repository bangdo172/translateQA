He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things.

To do so, <b8_0>the cause<b8_0/> must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect."}
