The larger, <a1_0><b6_0>Al-Shifa<b6_0/>'<a1_0/> (Sanatio), exists nearly complete in manuscript in <a2_0>the <b7_0>Bodleian Library<b7_0/><a2_0/> and elsewhere; part of it on the De Anima appeared at Pavia (1490) as the Liber Sextus Naturalium, and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by Muhammad al-Shahrastani seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as <a3_0>the <b8_0>An-najat<b8_0/><a3_0/> (Liberatio). The Latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied. There is also a \u062d\u0643\u0645\u062a \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0642\u064a\u0647 (hikmat-al-mashriqqiyya, in Latin Philosophia Orientalis), mentioned by Roger Bacon, the majority of which is lost in antiquity, which according to Averroes was pantheistic in tone."}
