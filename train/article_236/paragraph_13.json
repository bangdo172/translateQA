Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to <a1_0><b5_0>al-Farabi<b5_0/><a1_0/>. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from Occasionalism can be seen in what is left of his work."}
