This chaos reached a climax in January of <a0_0>52 BC<a0_0/>, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by <a1_0>Milo<a1_0/>. On 1 January 49 BC, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic. Meanwhile, the senators adopted <a2_0>Pompey<a2_0/> as their new champion against Caesar. On 7 January of 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which vested Pompey with <a3_0>dictatorial<a3_0/> powers. Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts. On 10 January, Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army (in violation of Roman laws) and marched towards Rome. <a4_0>Caesar's rapid advance<a4_0/> forced Pompey, the consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed."}
