As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and <a1_0>leading plebeian families<a1_0/> became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and <a4_0>political success<a4_0/> inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into <a2_0>the Justinian Code<a2_0/>, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations."}
