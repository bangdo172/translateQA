In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, gave him the <a1_0>power to veto<a1_0/> the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In <a2_0>46 BC<a2_0/>, Caesar was given censorial powers, which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then <a3_0>raised the membership of the Senate to 900<a3_0/>. This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus, the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him."}
