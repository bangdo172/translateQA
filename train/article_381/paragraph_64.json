While it did not pass many laws, <a2_0>the Comitia Tributa<a2_0/> did elect quaestors, curule aediles, and military tribunes. The Plebeian Council was identical to the assembly of the tribes, but excluded the patricians (the elite who could trace their ancestry to the founding of Rome).

This assembly passed most laws, and could also act as a court of appeal."}
