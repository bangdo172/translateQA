In <a1_0>83 BC<a1_0/>, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and recaptured the city. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered <a2_0>most of Marius' supporters<a2_0/>. Sulla, having observed the violent results of radical popular reforms, was naturally conservative. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and by extension the senate.
