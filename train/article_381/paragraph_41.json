Marius, a member of the \"<a3_0>populares<a3_0/>\" party, had a tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates. Sulla, a member of the aristocratic (\"optimates\") party, brought his army back to Italy and marched on Rome. <a2_0>Sulla<a2_0/> was so angry at Marius' tribune that he passed a law intended to permanently weaken the tribunate.
