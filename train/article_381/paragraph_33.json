During the early republic, only consuls could appoint new senators. This initiative, however, transferred this power to the censors. It also required <a4_0>the censor<a4_0/> to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the senate. By this point, <a1_0>plebeians<a1_0/> were already holding a significant number of magisterial offices. Thus, the number of plebeian senators probably increased quickly. However, it remained difficult for a plebeian to enter the senate if he was not from a well-known political family, as a new patrician-like plebeian aristocracy emerged. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because <a2_0>only patricians<a2_0/> were allowed to stand for high office. The new nobility existed due to the organization of society. As such, only a revolution could overthrow this new structure."}
