Around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, Marcus Licinius Crassus, had just put down the <a3_0>Spartacus<a3_0/>-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the populares party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution. They attempted to forge an agreement with the populares party. If both <a1_0>Pompey<a1_0/> and Crassus were elected consul in <a2_0>70 BC<a2_0/>, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The two were soon elected, and quickly dismantled most of Sulla's constitution."}
