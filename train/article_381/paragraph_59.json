The legion's main sub-unit was called a <a3_0>cohort<a3_0/> and consisted of approximately <a0_0>480 infantrymen<a0_0/>. The cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier maniple sub-unit, and was divided into six centuries of 80 men each. Each century was separated further into 10 \"tent groups\" of <a1_0>8 men<a1_0/> each. The <a2_0>cavalry troops<a2_0/> were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry. Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops."}
