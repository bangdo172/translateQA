In <a0_0>53 BC<a0_0/>, <a1_0>Crassus<a1_0/> launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern Iraq and Iran). After initial successes, he marched his army deep into the desert; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at <a2_0>the Battle of Carrhae<a2_0/> in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, <a3_0>Pompey<a3_0/> proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. In 51 BC, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he <a4_0>turned over control of his armies to the state<a4_0/>, which would have left Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial."}
