The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the <a1_0>senators<a1_0/> refused to address their situation. The result was <a3_0>the final plebeian secession<a3_0/>. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (<a2_0>the Lex Hortensia<a2_0/>), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This was not the first law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility."}
