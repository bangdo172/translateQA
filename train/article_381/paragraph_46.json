His colleague, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, was an extreme aristocrat. Caesar submitted the laws that he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. <a0_0>Bibulus<a0_0/> attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage. Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated the election of the former patrician <a4_0>Publius Clodius Pulcher<a4_0/> to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in Cato and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a <a1_0>sacrilege case<a1_0/>. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in <a3_0>Cicero<a3_0/> going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. <a2_0>Clodius<a2_0/> also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens."}
