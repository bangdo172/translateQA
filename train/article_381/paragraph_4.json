In the 2nd century BC, Roman involvement in the Greek east remained a matter of <a2_0>alliance-seeking<a2_0/>, but this time in the face of major powers that could rival Rome. According to <a1_0>Polybius<a1_0/>, who sought to trace how Rome came to dominate the Greek east in less than a century, this was mainly a matter of several <a3_0>Greek<a3_0/> city-states seeking Roman protection against the Macedonian kingdom and Seleucid Empire in the face of <a0_0>destabilisation<a0_0/> created by the weakening of Ptolemaic Egypt. In contrast to the west, the Greek east had been dominated by major empires for centuries, and Roman influence and alliance-seeking led to wars with these empires that further weakened them and therefore created an unstable power vacuum that only Rome could fill. This had some important similarities to (and important differences from) the events in Italy centuries earlier, but this time on a global scale."}
