Carthage was almost defenceless, and submitted when besieged. However, the Romans demanded <a3_0>complete surrender<a3_0/> and moval of the city into the (desert) inland far off any coastal or harbour region, and the Carthaginians refused. The city was besieged, stormed, and completely destroyed. Ultimately, all of Carthage's North African and Iberian territories were acquired by Rome.
