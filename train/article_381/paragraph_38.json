He attempted to enact a law which would have limited the amount of land that any individual could own. The aristocrats, who stood to lose an enormous amount of money, were bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the Plebeian Council, but the law was vetoed by a tribune named <a3_0>Marcus Octavius<a3_0/>. Tiberius then used the Plebeian Council to impeach Octavius. The theory, <a4_0>that a representative of the people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people<a4_0/>, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority. His law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered with 300 of his associates <a2_0>when he stood for reelection to the tribunate<a2_0/>."}
