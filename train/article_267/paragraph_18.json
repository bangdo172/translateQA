Several institutions, besides those already mentioned, played important parts. Such is the <a0_0><b5_0>Biblical school at Jerusalem<b5_0/><a0_0/>, open to the religious of the order and to secular clerics, which publishes the Revue Biblique. The faculty of theology at the University of Fribourg, confided to the care of the Dominicans in <a2_0><b7_0>1890<b7_0/><a2_0/>, is flourishing, and has about <a1_0><b6_0>250<b6_0/><a1_0/> students. The Pontificium Collegium Internationale Angelicum, the future <a3_0><b8_0>Pontifical University of Saint Thomas<b8_0/> Aquinas<a3_0/>, Angelicum established at Rome in 1908 by Master Hyacinth Cormier, opened its doors to regulars and seculars for the study of the sacred sciences. In addition to the reviews above are the Revue Thomiste, founded by <a4_0><b9_0>P\u00e8re Thomas Coconnier<b9_0/><a4_0/> (d. 1908), and the Analecta Ordinis Pr\u00e6dicatorum (1893). Among numerous writers of the order in this period are: Cardinals Thomas Zigliara (d. 1893) and Zephirin Gonz\u00e1lez (d. 1894), two esteemed philosophers; Alberto Guillelmotti (d. 1893), historian of the Pontifical Navy, and Heinrich Denifle, one of the most famous writers on medieval history (d. 1905).[citation needed]"}
