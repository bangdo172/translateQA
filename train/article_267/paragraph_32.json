Many of the German religious houses that lodged women had been home to communities of women, such as <a3_0>Beguines<a3_0/>, that became Dominican once they were taught by the traveling preachers and put under the jurisdiction of the Dominican authoritative structure. A number of these houses became centers of study and mystical spirituality in the 14th century. There were <a4_0>one hundred and fifty-seven<a4_0/> nunneries in the order by 1358. In that year, the number lessened due to disasters like the Black Death."}
