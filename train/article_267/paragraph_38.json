Actually, the Dominican brothers likely began a school immediately after their arrival, as priories were legally schools. Information about the schools of the English Province is limited, but a few facts are known. Much of the information available is taken from visitation records. The \"visitation\" was a section of the province through which visitors to each priory could describe the state of its religious life and its studies to the next chapter. There were four such visits in England and Wales\u2014Oxford, London, Cambridge and York. All Dominican students were required to learn <b8_0>grammar, old and new logic, <a2_0>natural philosophy<a2_0/> and theology<b8_0/>. Of all of the curricular areas, however, <a3_0><b9_0>theology<b9_0/><a3_0/> was the most important. This is not surprising when one remembers Dominic's zeal for it."}
