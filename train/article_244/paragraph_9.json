Three years later, with most of the original DigiDestined now in high school at age <a1_0>fourteen<a1_0/>, the Digital World was supposedly secure and peaceful. However, <b5_0>a new evil<b5_0/> has appeared in the form of the Digimon Emperor (<a2_0>Digimon Kaiser<a2_0/>) who as opposed to previous enemies is a human just like the DigiDestined. The Digimon Emperor has been <b6_0>enslaving Digimon<b6_0/> with Dark Rings and Control Spires and has somehow made regular Digivolution impossible. However, five set Digi-Eggs with engraved emblems had been appointed to three new DigiDestined along with T.K. and Kari, two of the DigiDestined from the previous series. This new evolutionary process, dubbed Armor Digivolution helps the new DigiDestined to defeat evil lurking in the Digital World. Eventually, the DigiDestined defeat the Digimon Emperor, more commonly known as Ken Ichijouji on Earth, only with the great sacrifice of Ken's own Digimon, Wormmon. Just when things were thought to be settled, new Digimon enemies made from the deactivated Control Spires start to appear and cause trouble in the Digital World. To atone for his past mistakes, Ken <a3_0>joins the DigiDestined<a3_0/>, being a DigiDestined himself, with his Partner Wormmon revived to fight against them. They soon save countries including <b8_0>France and Australia<b8_0/> from control spires and defeat MaloMyotismon (BelialVamdemon), the digivolved form of Myotismon (Vamdemon) from the previous series. They stop the evil from destroying the two worlds, and at the end, every person on Earth gains their own <b7_0>Digimon partner<b7_0/>."}
