The small areas of the screens (<a5_0>16 by 16 pixels<a5_0/>) meant that character designers had to create monsters whose forms would be easily recognizable. As such, many of the early Digimon\u2014including <a4_0>Tyrannomon<a4_0/>, the first one ever created\u2014were based on <a1_0><a6_0><b10_0>dinosaurs<b10_0/><a6_0/><a1_0/>. Many further designs were created by <a3_0><a7_0>Kenji Watanabe<a7_0/><a3_0/>, who was brought in to help with the \"X-Antibody\" creatures and art for the Digimon collectible card game. Watanabe was one influenced by <a8_0><b11_0><b12_0>American comics<b12_0/><b11_0/><a8_0/>, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look <a2_0>stronger and \"cool.\"<a2_0/> The <b13_0>character creation<b13_0/> process, however, has for most of the franchise's history been collaborative and reliant on conversation and brainstorming."}
