However, controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate. Maulana Karenga argues that the term <a3_0>African-American<a3_0/> is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin.[citation needed] Others have argued that \"black\" is a better term <a4_0>because \"African\" suggests foreignness<a4_0/>, although Black Americans helped found the United States. Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones. Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for \"African American\" or \"Black\", although they have a slight preference for \"black\" in personal settings and \"African American\" in more formal settings."}
