Thus, we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism, but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms: broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits and (presumable from the rest of [Arthur] Miller's senescent musings) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same.\" Some black activists were also offended, claiming that <a3_0>Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain<a3_0/> as no other president had before, while not serving black interests. They cite the lack of action during the <a4_0>Rwandan Genocide<a4_0/> and his welfare reform, which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s. Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration."}
