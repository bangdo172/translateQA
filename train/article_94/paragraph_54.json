Scholars estimate that <a1_0>more than half<a1_0/> of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals. Brazil has the largest population of <a2_0>Afro-descendants<a2_0/> outside of Africa. In contrast to the US, during the slavery period and after, the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or <a3_0>segregation laws<a3_0/>. As in other Latin countries, <a4_0>intermarriage<a4_0/> was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward. In addition, people of mixed race (pardo) often tended to marry white, and their descendants became accepted as white. As a result, some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census of the 20th century, in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified, 54% of individuals identified as white, 6.2% identified as black, and 39.5% identified as pardo (brown) \u2014 a broad multi-racial category, including tri-racial persons."}
