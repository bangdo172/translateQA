An indentured servant, he was \"bound for life\" in <a2_0>1640<a2_0/> after <a3_0>trying to escape<a3_0/>. The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women, likely indentured servants and working-class like them. Their multi-racial children were free because <a4_0>they were born to free English women<a4_0/>. Over time, Obama's line of the Bunch family (as they became known) were property owners and continued to \"marry white\"; they became part of white society, likely by the early to mid-18th century."}
