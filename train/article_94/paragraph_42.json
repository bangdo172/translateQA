Individuals identified themselves, for example, as Ashanti, Igbo, Bakongo, or Wolof. However, when the first captives were brought to the Americas, they were often combined with other groups from West Africa, and <a1_0>individual ethnic affiliations<a1_0/> were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region: the <a2_0>West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast<a2_0/> such as Mozambique. A new African-American identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the Black church and Black English. <a3_0>This new identity was based on provenance and slave status<a3_0/> rather than membership in any one ethnic group.[citation needed] By contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the <a4_0>French and Spanish colonists<a4_0/> recorded more complete identities of the West Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names."}
