They used more black female slaves in <a1_0>domestic service and agriculture<a1_0/> than males. The men interpreted the Qur'an to permit <a2_0>sexual relations between a male master and his female slave<a2_0/> outside of marriage (see Ma malakat aymanukum and sex), leading to many mixed-race children. When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master's child, she was considered as <a3_0>umm walad<a3_0/> or <a4_0>\"mother of a child\"<a4_0/>, a status that granted her privileged rights. The child was given rights of inheritance to the father's property, so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father. Because the society was patrilineal, the children took their fathers' social status at birth and were born free."}
