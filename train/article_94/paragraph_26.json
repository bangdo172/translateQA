Despite this, Negritos are never referred to as black today, and doing so would cause offense. The term Negrito itself has come under criticism in countries like Malaysia, where it is now interchangeable with the more acceptable <a4_0>Semang<a4_0/>, although this term actually refers to a specific group. The common Thai word for Negritos literally means \"frizzy hair\"."}
