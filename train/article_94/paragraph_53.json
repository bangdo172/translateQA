It is generally believed that achieving upward mobility and education results in individuals being classified as a category of <a0_0>lighter skin<a0_0/>. The popular claim is that in Brazil, poor whites are considered <a1_0>black<a1_0/> and wealthy blacks are considered <a2_0>white<a2_0/>. Some scholars disagree, arguing that \"whitening\" of one's social status may be open to people of mixed race, a large part of the population known as pardo, but a person perceived as preto <a3_0>(black)<a3_0/> will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status."}
