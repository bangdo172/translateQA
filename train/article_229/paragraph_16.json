The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to <a3_0>protect the economic heartland<a3_0/>, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to <a4_0>strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps<a4_0/> known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers."}
