Geneva converted to Protestantism in <a0_0>1536<a0_0/>, just before John Calvin arrived there. One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Z\u00fcrich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland, the Valais, the Ticino, Appenzell Innerrhodes, the Jura, and Fribourg are traditionally Catholic. The Swiss Constitution of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg, consciously defines a consociational state, <a1_0>allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants<a1_0/>. A <a2_0>1980<a2_0/> initiative calling for the complete separation of church and state was rejected by <a3_0>78.9%<a3_0/> of the voters. Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a slight Catholic majority, not because they were growing in members, quite the contrary, but only because since about 1970 a steadily growing minority became not affiliated with any church or other religious body (21.4% in Switzerland, 2012) especially in traditionally Protestant regions, such as Basel-City (42%), canton of Neuch\u00e2tel (38%), canton of Geneva (35%), canton of Vaud (26%), or Z\u00fcrich city (city: >25%; canton: 23%)."}
