This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from <a4_0>the south<a4_0/> due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect. The driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while <a2_0>crossing the mountains<a2_0/> before reaching these areas. Large alpine areas such as Graub\u00fcnden remain drier than pre-alpine areas and as in the main valley of the Valais <a3_0>wine<a3_0/> grapes are grown there."}
