This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on <a1_0>local issues<a1_0/>. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an upper house (the <a3_0>Council of States<a3_0/>, <a2_0>two<a2_0/> representatives per canton) and a lower house (the <a4_0>National Council<a4_0/>, with representatives elected from across the country). Referenda were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution."}
