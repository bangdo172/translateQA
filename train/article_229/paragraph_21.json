It contains three basic topographical areas: the <a0_0>Swiss Alps<a0_0/> to the south, the Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau, and the <a2_0>Jura mountains<a2_0/> on the west. The Alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country, comprising about <a3_0>60%<a3_0/> of the country's total area. The majority of the Swiss population live in the <a1_0>Swiss Plateau<a1_0/>. Among the high valleys of the Swiss Alps many glaciers are found, totalling an area of 1,063 square kilometres (410 sq mi). From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the Rhine, Inn, Ticino and Rh\u00f4ne, which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of Europe. The hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in Central and Western Europe, among which are included Lake Geneva (also called le Lac L\u00e9man in French), Lake Constance (known as Bodensee in German) and Lake Maggiore. Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes, and contains 6% of Europe's stock of fresh water. Lakes and glaciers cover about 6% of the national territory. The largest lake is Lake Geneva, in western Switzerland shared with France. The Rh\u00f4ne is both the main source and outflow of Lake Geneva. Lake Constance is the second largest Swiss lake and, like the <a4_0>Lake Geneva<a4_0/>, an intermediate step by the Rhine at the border to Austria and Germany. While the Rh\u00f4ne flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the French Camarque region and the Rhine flows into the North Sea at Rotterdam in the Netherlands, about 1000 km apart, both springs are only about 22 km apart from each other in the Swiss Alps."}
