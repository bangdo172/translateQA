Switzerland is a founding member of the EFTA, but is not a member of the <a3_0>European Economic Area<a3_0/>. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referenda on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by <a4_0>the EU<a4_0/> since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a <a2_0>55%<a2_0/> majority to join the <a1_0>Schengen treaty<a1_0/>, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies."}
