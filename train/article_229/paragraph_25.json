The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of <a1_0>plants not found at other altitudes<a1_0/>, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to <a2_0>climate change<a2_0/>. Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks <a0_0>first among 132 nations<a0_0/> in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on <a3_0>renewable<a3_0/> sources of energy (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions."}
