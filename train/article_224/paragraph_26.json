There is a strong belief on the island that some of the revenue generated from Norfolk's EEZ should be available to providing services such as <a0_0><b5_0>health and infrastructure<b5_0/><a0_0/> on the island, which the island has been responsible for, similar to how the Northern Territory is able to access revenue from their mineral resources. The exclusive economic zone provides the islanders with <a1_0><b6_0>fish<b6_0/><a1_0/>, its only major natural resource. Norfolk Island has no direct control over any marine areas but has an agreement with the Commonwealth through the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) to fish \"recreationally\" in a small section of the EEZ known locally as \"<a2_0><b7_0>the Box<b7_0/><a2_0/>\". While there is speculation that the zone may include <a3_0><b8_0>oil and gas deposits<b8_0/><a3_0/>, this is not proven. There are no major arable lands or permanent farmlands, though about <a4_0><b9_0>25<b9_0/><a4_0/> per cent of the island is a permanent pasture. There is no irrigated land. The island uses the Australian dollar as its currency."}
