In 2004 an act of the Norfolk Island Assembly made it a co-official language of the island. The act is long-titled: \"An Act to recognise the Norfolk Island Language (Norf'k) as an official language of Norfolk Island.\" The \"language known as 'Norf'k'\" is described as the language \"that is spoken by <a2_0>descendants of the first free settlers of Norfolk Island who were descendants of the settlers of Pitcairn Island<a2_0/>\". The act recognises and protects use of the language but does not require it; in official use, it must be accompanied by an accurate translation into English. 32% of the total population reported speaking a language other than English in the 2011 census, and just <a4_0><b8_0>under three-quarters<b8_0/><a4_0/> of the ordinarily resident population could speak Norfuk."}
