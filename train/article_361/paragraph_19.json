He writes: \"The Qur'an draws attention to the danger of conjecturing without evidence (And follow not that of which you have not the (certain) knowledge of... 17:36) and in several different verses asks Muslims to require proofs (Say: Bring your <a1_0>proof<a1_0/> if you are truthful 2:111), both in matters of theological belief and in natural science.\" Guessoum cites <a2_0><b7_0>Ghaleb Hasan<b7_0/><a2_0/> on the definition of \"<b6_0>proof<b6_0/>\" according the Quran being \"clear and strong... convincing evidence or argument.\" Also, such a proof cannot rely on an argument from authority, citing verse 5:104. Lastly, both assertions and rejections require a proof, according to verse 4:174. Ismail al-Faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any reawakening of the Muslim civilization must start with the Quran; however, the biggest obstacle on this route is the \"centuries old heritage of tafseer (exegesis) and other classical disciplines\" which inhibit a \"universal, epidemiological and systematic conception\" of the Quran's message. The philosopher <a3_0><b8_0>Muhammad Iqbal<b8_0/><a3_0/>, considered the Quran's methodology and epistemology to be empirical and rational."}
