The agent of revelation is mentioned as the \"one mighty in power\", the one who \"grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) <a1_0><b5_0>two bows' length<b5_0/><a1_0/> or even nearer.\" The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the <a2_0><b6_0>Encyclopaedia of Islam<b6_0/><a2_0/> that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch, these <a0_0><b4_0>seizures<b4_0/><a0_0/> would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being <a3_0><b7_0><b8_0>a possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician<b8_0/><b7_0/><a3_0/> since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia. Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial claim of prophethood."}
