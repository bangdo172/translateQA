It is a verbal noun (ma\u1e63dar) of the Arabic verb <a0_0><b4_0><b5_0>qara\u02bca<b5_0/><b4_0/><a0_0/> (\u0642\u0631\u0623), meaning \"he read\" or \"he recited\". The Syriac equivalent is (\u0729\u072a\u071d\u0722\u0710) <a1_0><b6_0>qery\u0101n\u0101<b6_0/><a1_0/>, which refers to \"scripture reading\" or \"lesson\". While some Western scholars consider the word to be derived from the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities hold the origin of the word is <a3_0><b8_0>qara\u02bca<b8_0/><a3_0/> itself. Regardless, it had become an Arabic term by Muhammad's lifetime. An important meaning of the word is the \"act of <a2_0><b7_0>reciting<b7_0/><a2_0/>\", as reflected in an early Quranic passage: \"It is for Us to collect it and to recite it (qur\u02bc\u0101nahu).\""}
