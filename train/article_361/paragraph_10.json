According to the tests carried out by Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, \"with a probability of more than 95%, the parchment was from between 568 and 645\". The manuscript is written in <a1_0><b6_0>Hijazi<b6_0/><a1_0/> script, an early form of written <a2_0><b7_0>Arabic<b7_0/><a2_0/>. This is possibly the earliest extant exemplar of the Quran, but as the tests allow a range of possible dates, it cannot be said with certainty which of the existing versions is the oldest. Saudi scholar Saud al-Sarhan has expressed doubt over the age of the fragments as they contain <a3_0><b8_0>dots and chapter separators<b8_0/><a3_0/> that are believed to have originated later."}
