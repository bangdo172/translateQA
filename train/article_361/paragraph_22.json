Rhyme, while found throughout the Quran, is conspicuous in many of the <a1_0><b6_0>earlier Meccan suras<b6_0/><a1_0/>, in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence. The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers. Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the <a2_0><b7_0>subject of discussion<b7_0/><a2_0/>. <a3_0><b8_0>Later<b8_0/><a3_0/> sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository."}
