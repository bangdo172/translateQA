Commentators erudite in Arabic explained the allusions, and perhaps most importantly, explained which Quranic verses had been revealed early in Muhammad's prophetic career, as being appropriate to the very earliest Muslim community, and which had been revealed later, canceling out or \"abrogating\" (<a1_0><b7_0>n\u0101sikh<b7_0/><a1_0/>) the earlier text (<a4_0><b9_0>mans\u016bkh<b9_0/><a4_0/>). Other scholars, however, maintain that no abrogation has taken place in the Quran. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has published a ten-volume <a3_0>Urdu<a3_0/> commentary on the Quran, with the name <a2_0><b8_0>Tafseer e Kabir<b8_0/><a2_0/>."}
