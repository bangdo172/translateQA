Medieval commentators such as Al-Tabari maintained that the term induced two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; second, the inexperience or ignorance of the previous books or scriptures (but they gave priority to the first meaning). Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as a sign of the genuineness of his prophethood. For example, according to Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, if Muhammad had mastered <a3_0><b8_0>writing and reading<b8_0/><a3_0/> he possibly would have been suspected of having studied the books of the ancestors. Some scholars such as Watt prefer the second meaning of \"<b7_0>ummi<b7_0/>\" - they take it to indicate unfamiliarity with <a1_0><b6_0>earlier sacred texts<b6_0/><a1_0/>."}
