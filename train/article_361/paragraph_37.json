Its language was similar to the <a2_0><b7_0>Syriac<b7_0/><a2_0/> language.[citation needed] The Quran recounts stories of many of the people and events recounted in Jewish and Christian sacred books (Tanakh, Bible) and devotional literature (Apocrypha, Midrash), although it differs in many details. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Eber, Shelah, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Jethro, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Aaron, Moses, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus are mentioned in the Quran as prophets of God (see Prophets of Islam). In fact, <a0_0><b5_0>Moses<b5_0/><a0_0/> is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual. Jesus is mentioned more often in the Quran than Muhammad, while <a3_0><b8_0>Mary<b8_0/><a3_0/> is mentioned in the Quran more than the New Testament. Muslims believe the common elements or resemblances between the Bible and other Jewish and Christian writings and Islamic dispensations is due to their <a4_0><b9_0>common divine source<b9_0/><a4_0/>,[citation needed] and that the original Christian or Jewish texts were authentic divine revelations given to prophets."}
