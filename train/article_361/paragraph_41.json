The meaning of revelation (tanzil), as opposed to ta'wil, is clear in its accordance to the obvious meaning of the words as they were revealed. But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of ta'wil, which originally meant <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0>\"to return\" or \"the returning place\"<b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/>. In Tabatabaei's view, what has been rightly called ta'wil, or <a2_0><b7_0>hermeneutic<b7_0/><a2_0/> interpretation of the Quran, is not concerned simply with the denotation of words. Rather, it is concerned with certain truths and realities that transcend the comprehension of the common run of men; yet it is from these truths and realities that the principles of doctrine and the practical injunctions of the Quran issue forth. Interpretation is not the meaning of the verse\u2014rather it transpires through that meaning, in a special sort of transpiration. There is <a0_0><b3_0><b4_0>a spiritual reality<b4_0/><b3_0/><a0_0/>\u2014which is the main objective of ordaining a law, or the basic aim in describing a divine attribute\u2014and then there is an actual significance that a Quranic story refers to."}
