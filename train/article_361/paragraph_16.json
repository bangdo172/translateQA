It is estimated that approximately <a0_0><b4_0>one-third<b4_0/><a0_0/> of the Quran is eschatological, dealing with the afterlife in the next world and with the day of judgment at the end of time. There is a reference to the afterlife on most pages of the Quran and belief in the afterlife is often referred to in conjunction with belief in God as in the common expression: \"Believe in God and the last day\". A number of suras such as 44, 56, 75, 78, 81 and 101 are directly related to the <a3_0><b8_0>afterlife<b8_0/><a3_0/> and its preparations. Some suras indicate the closeness of the event and warn people to be prepared for the imminent day. For instance, the first verses of Sura 22, which deal with the mighty <a2_0><b6_0><b7_0>earthquake<b7_0/><b6_0/><a2_0/> and the situations of people on that day, represent this style of divine address: \"O People! Be respectful to your Lord. The earthquake of the Hour is a mighty thing.\""}
