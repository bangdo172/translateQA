Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to <a2_0><b7_0>God<b7_0/><a2_0/>. In contrast, Quranic literalism, followed by <a3_0><b8_0>Salafis and Zahiris<b8_0/><a3_0/>, is the belief that the Quran should only be taken at its apparent meaning.[citation needed]"}
