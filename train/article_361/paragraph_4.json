Each synonym possesses its own distinct meaning, but its use may converge with that of qur\u02bc\u0101n in certain contexts. Such terms include <a0_0><b4_0>kit\u0101b<b4_0/><a0_0/> (book); \u0101yah (sign); and <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0>s\u016brah<b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/> (scripture). The latter two terms also denote units of revelation. In the large majority of contexts, usually with a definite article (al-), the word is referred to as the \"revelation\" (<a3_0><b8_0>wa\u1e25y<b8_0/><a3_0/>), that which has been \"sent down\" (tanz\u012bl) at intervals. Other related words are: dhikr (remembrance), used to refer to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and \u1e25ikmah (<a2_0><b7_0>wisdom<b7_0/><a2_0/>), sometimes referring to the revelation or part of it."}
