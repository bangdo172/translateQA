Suras are classified as <a2_0><b7_0><b8_0>Meccan or Medinan<b8_0/><b7_0/><a2_0/>, depending on whether the verses were revealed before or after the migration of Muhammad to the city of Medina. However, a sura classified as Medinan may contain Meccan verses in it and vice versa. Sura titles are derived from a name or quality discussed in the text, or from the first letters or words of the sura. Suras are arranged roughly in order of <b9_0>decreasing <a3_0>size<b9_0/><a3_0/>. The sura arrangement is thus not connected to the sequence of revelation. Each sura except the ninth starts with the <a4_0>Bismillah<a4_0/> (\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645), an Arabic phrase meaning \"In the name of God\". There are, however, still 114 occurrences of the Bismillah in the Quran, due to its presence in Quran 27:30 as the opening of Solomon's letter to the Queen of Sheba."}
