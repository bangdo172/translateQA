According to Stefan Wild, the Quran demonstrates this metatextuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted. <a0_0>Self-referentiality<a0_0/> is evident in those passages where the Quran refers to itself as revelation (tanzil), remembrance (dhikr), news (<a2_0><b7_0>naba'<b7_0/><a2_0/>), criterion (furqan) in a self-designating manner (explicitly asserting its <a1_0><b5_0><b6_0>Divinity<b6_0/><b5_0/><a1_0/>, \"And this is a blessed Remembrance that We have sent down; so are you now denying it?\"), or in the frequent appearance of the \"Say\" tags, when Muhammad is commanded to speak (e.g., \"Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance' \", \"Say: 'Would you then dispute with us concerning God?' \"). According to Wild the Quran is highly self-referential. The feature is more evident in <a3_0><b8_0>early Meccan suras<b8_0/><a3_0/>."}
