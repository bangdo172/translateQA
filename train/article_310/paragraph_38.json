As Apollo played the <a0_0>lyre<a0_0/>, this was easy to do. <a2_0>Marsyas<a2_0/> could not do this, as he only knew how to use the <a1_0>flute<a1_0/> and could not sing at the same time. Apollo was declared the winner because of this. Apollo flayed Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god. He then nailed Marsyas' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree. <a3_0>Marsyas' blood<a3_0/> turned into the river Marsyas."}
