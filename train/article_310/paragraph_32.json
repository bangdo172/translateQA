The myth explains the connection of Apollo with \u03b4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bd\u03b7 (daphn\u0113), the laurel whose leaves his priestess employed at Delphi. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Phoebus Apollo chaffs Cupid for toying with a weapon more suited to a man, whereupon Cupid wounds him with a golden dart; simultaneously, however, <a2_0>Cupid<a2_0/> shoots a leaden arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo. Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prays to her father, <a1_0>Peneus<a1_0/>, for help, and he changes her into the laurel tree, sacred to Apollo."}
