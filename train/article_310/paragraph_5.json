The role of Apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of Apollo Smintheus (\"mouse Apollo\") by <a3_0>Chryses<a3_0/>, the Trojan priest of Apollo, with the purpose of sending a plague against the Greeks (the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is of course apotropaic, meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague)."}
