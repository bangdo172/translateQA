The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for <a2_0>Hyperborea<a2_0/>, he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the Borghese Vase."}
