Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9 (<a2_0>apollymi<a2_0/>), \"to destroy\". Plato in Cratylus connects the name with \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (apolysis), \"redemption\", with \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (apolousis), \"purification\", and with \u1f01\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd ([h]aploun), \"simple\", in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, \u1f0c\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, and finally with \u1f08\u03b5\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd (aeiballon), \"ever-shooting\". Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric \u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 (<a0_0>apella<a0_0/>), which means \"assembly\", so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation \u03c3\u03b7\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (sekos), \"fold\", in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds. In the Ancient Macedonian language \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 (<a1_0>pella<a1_0/>) means \"stone,\" and some toponyms may be derived from this word: \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 (Pella, the capital of Ancient Macedonia) and \u03a0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 (Pell\u0113n\u0113/Pallene)."}
