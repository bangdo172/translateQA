The name of Apollo's mother Leto has <a0_0>Lydian<a0_0/> origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of <a1_0>Asia Minor<a1_0/>. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from <a2_0>Anatolia<a2_0/>, which is the origin of Sibyl, and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old Assyro-Babylonian texts, and these rituals were spread into the empire of the Hittites. In a Hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a Babylonian priestess for a certain \"purification\"."}
