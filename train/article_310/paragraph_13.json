The inspiration oracular-cult was probably introduced from <a1_0>Anatolia<a1_0/>. The ritualism belonged to Apollo from the beginning. <a2_0>The Greeks<a2_0/> created the legalism, the supervision of the orders of the gods, and the demand for moderation and harmony. Apollo became the god of shining youth, the protector of music, spiritual-life, moderation and perceptible order. The improvement of the old Anatolian god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the Greek people."}
