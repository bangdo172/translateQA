Pae\u03bfn is probably connected with the Mycenean pa-ja-wo-ne (Linear B: \ud800\udc1e\ud800\udc0a\ud800\udc0d\ud800\udc1a), but this is not certain. He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease. Later the Greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song \"paean\" (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd). The magicians were also called \"<a0_0>seer-doctors<a0_0/>\" (\u1f30\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2), and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god Apollo at the oracles."}
