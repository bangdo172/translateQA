The spelling \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd (pronounced [a.p\u00f3l.l\u0254\u02d0n] in Classical Attic) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era, but the Doric form Apellon (\u1f08\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd), is more archaic, derived from an earlier *\u1f08\u03c0\u03ad\u03bbj\u03c9\u03bd. It probably is a cognate to the Doric month <a1_0>Apellaios<a1_0/> (\u1f08\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2), and the offerings <a2_0>apellaia<a2_0/> (\u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai (\u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9). According to some scholars the words are derived from the Doric word <a3_0>apella<a3_0/> (\u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1), which originally meant \"wall,\" \"fence for animals\" and later \"assembly within the limits of the square.\" <a0_0>Apella<a0_0/> (\u1f08\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta, corresponding to the ecclesia (\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1). R. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form *Apalyun."}
