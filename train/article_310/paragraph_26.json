Here we have an apotropaic situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. <a2_0>Aplu<a2_0/>, meaning the son of, was a title given to the god Nergal, who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun Shamash. Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god (\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2) who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods. In Iliad, his priest prays to <a3_0>Apollo Smintheus<a3_0/>, the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats. All these functions, including the function of the healer-god Paean, who seems to have Mycenean origin, are fused in the cult of Apollo."}
