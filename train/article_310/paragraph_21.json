This led some scholars to the conclusion that <a0_0>Pythia<a0_0/> carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries, according to the local tradition. In that regard, the mythical seeress <a1_0>Sibyl<a1_0/> of Anatolian origin, with her ecstatic art, looks unrelated to the oracle itself. However, the Greek tradition is referring to the <a2_0>existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves<a2_0/>, which seem to be confirmed by recent studies."}
