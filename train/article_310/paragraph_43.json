The forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas. The Greek words oida (\u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b1, \"(I) know\") and <a2_0>eidos<a2_0/> (\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, \"species\") have the same root as the word idea (\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1), indicating how the Greek mind moved from the gift of the senses, to the principles beyond the senses. The artists in Plato's time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization. The Greek sculptors considered the senses more important, and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual."}
