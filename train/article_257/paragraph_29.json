He analysed sexual selection more fully in <a1_0>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex<a1_0/> (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could \"see <a2_0>no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings<a2_0/>, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection\". Using <a3_0>a tree diagram and calculations<a3_0/>, he indicates the \"divergence of character\" from original species into new species and genera. He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred, while new branches formed in \"the great Tree of life ... with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications\"."}
