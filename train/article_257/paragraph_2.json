As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by <a1_0>T. H. Huxley<a1_0/> and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting <a2_0>scientific naturalism<a2_0/>. Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During <a3_0>\"the eclipse of Darwinism\"<a3_0/> from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis <a4_0>in the 1930s and 1940s<a4_0/>, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences."}
