It was long thought that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included <a1_0>fear of religious persecution or social disgrace<a1_0/> if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting <a3_0>his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma.<a3_0/> Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays.

David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time."}
