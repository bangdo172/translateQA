His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by <a2_0>William Thomson<a2_0/> (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who <a3_0>calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years<a3_0/>. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved <a4_0>in the 20th century<a4_0/>."}
