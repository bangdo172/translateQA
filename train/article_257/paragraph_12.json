Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim <a3_0>that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time.<a3_0/> But it proposed <a1_0>a linear progression<a1_0/> rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped to pave the way for the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, <a4_0>Herbert Spencer<a4_0/> became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s."}
