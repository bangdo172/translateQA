After the turmoil of the English Civil War, <a0_0>the Royal Society<a0_0/> wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. <a1_0>John Ray<a1_0/> developed an influential natural theology of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem. The biological classification introduced by <a2_0>Carl Linnaeus<a2_0/> in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of the 1650s had calculated creation at <a3_0>4004 BC<a3_0/>, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas, but <a4_0>James Hutton<a4_0/> proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating uniformitarianism."}
