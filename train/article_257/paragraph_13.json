In <a1_0>1854<a1_0/>, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in <a2_0>fancy pigeon<a2_0/> breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that <a4_0>plant seeds and animals<a4_0/> might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By <a3_0>1856<a3_0/>, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence."}
