This conflict could be reconciled <a0_0>by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans<a0_0/>, or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind's position at the head of nature. While many conservative theologians accepted evolution, <a1_0>Charles Hodge<a1_0/> argued in his 1874 critique \"What is Darwinism?\" that \"Darwinism\", defined narrowly as including rejection of design, was atheism though he accepted that Asa Gray did not reject design. Asa Gray responded that this charge misrepresented Darwin's text. By the early 20th century, four noted authors of The Fundamentals were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution, but fundamentalism inspired <a2_0>the American creation\u2013evolution controversy<a2_0/> that began in the 1920s. Some conservative Roman Catholic writers and influential Jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century, but other Catholic writers, starting with Mivart, pointed out that early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally in this area. <a3_0>The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical, which held that evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching."}
