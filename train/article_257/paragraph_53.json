Some political commentaries, including <a1_0>Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1872)<a1_0/>, attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in anthropology <a2_0>to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non white races and justify European imperialism<a2_0/>. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used <a3_0>to justify military aggression and unethical business practices<a3_0/> as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and <a4_0>he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry."}
