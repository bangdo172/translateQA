Darwin related this to the struggle for existence among wildlife and botanist de Candolle's <a3_0>\"warring of the species\"<a3_0/> in <a2_0>plants<a2_0/>; he immediately envisioned \"a force like a hundred thousand wedges\" pushing well-adapted variations into \"gaps in the economy of nature\", so that the survivors would pass on their form and abilities, and unfavourable variations would be destroyed. By December 1838, he had noted a similarity between the act of breeders selecting traits and a Malthusian Nature selecting among variants thrown up by \"chance\" so that \"every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected\"."}
