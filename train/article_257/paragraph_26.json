He concludes that \"a well-marked variety may be justly called an <a3_0>incipient species\"<a3_0/> and that <a1_0>\"species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties\"<a1_0/>. He argues for the ubiquity of variation in nature. Historians have noted that naturalists had long been aware that the individuals of a species differed from one another, but had <a4_0>generally considered such variations to be limited and unimportant deviations from the archetype of each species<a4_0/>, that archetype being a fixed ideal in the mind of God. Darwin and Wallace made <a2_0>variation among individuals of the same species<a2_0/> central to understanding the natural world."}
