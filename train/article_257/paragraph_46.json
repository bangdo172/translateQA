Darwin presented <a1_0>natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible.<a1_0/> His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to <a2_0>the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences<a2_0/>, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from <a3_0>the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862<a3_0/>. <a4_0>Henry Walter Bates<a4_0/> presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line."}
