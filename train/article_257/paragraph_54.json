In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen <a1_0>interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design<a1_0/>, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as \"just as noble a conception of Deity\". In the second edition of January 1860, <a2_0>Darwin quoted Kingsley as \"a celebrated cleric\", and added the phrase \"by the Creator\" to the closing sentence,<a2_0/> which from then on read \"life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\". While <a3_0>some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted<a3_0/>, <a4_0>Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature<a4_0/>, and even in the first edition there are several references to \"creation\"."}
