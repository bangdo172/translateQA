Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by <a2_0>Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics<a2_0/>, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that <a3_0>because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay<a3_0/>, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which <a4_0>would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail<a4_0/>. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience."}
