He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on <a2_0>Fertilisation of Orchids<a2_0/> that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to <a3_0>George Jackson Mivart<a3_0/>'s criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes on one side and the camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. <a4_0>Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature."}
