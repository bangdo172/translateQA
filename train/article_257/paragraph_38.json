Darwin expected species to change <a0_0>slowly, but not at the same rate<a0_0/> \u2013 some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on <a1_0>variability and change in the environment<a1_0/>. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited <a2_0>Richard Owen<a2_0/>'s findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. <a3_0>Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras<a3_0/>, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area."}
