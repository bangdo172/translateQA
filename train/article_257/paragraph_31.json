However, inherited variation could be seen, and <a2_0>Darwin's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable<a2_0/>. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis <a3_0>in the 1930s and 1940s<a3_0/> that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed <a4_0>Neo Darwinian Evolution<a4_0/> because it encompasses Charles Darwin's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel's theories of genetic inheritance."}
