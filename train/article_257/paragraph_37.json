Darwin borrowed <a0_0>Charles Lyell<a0_0/>'s argument in <a1_0>Principles of Geology<a1_0/> that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well founded hope <a2_0>that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms<a2_0/>. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he again cited Principles of Geology and other observations based on sedimentation and erosion, including an estimate that erosion of The Weald had taken <a3_0>300 million years<a3_0/>. The initial appearance of entire groups of well developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as <a4_0>the Cambrian explosion<a4_0/>, posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. Fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years."}
