Much of the initial reaction was hostile, but <a1_0>Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science<a1_0/>. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of <a2_0>social reform<a2_0/>. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. <a3_0>Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms<a3_0/>, and the newly coined term <a4_0>Darwinism<a4_0/> was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant."}
