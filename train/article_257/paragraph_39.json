The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that <a1_0>barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions.<a1_0/> The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. <a2_0>His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification.<a2_0/> He went on to say: \"On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.\" Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally."}
