In March 1837, <a3_0>ornithologist<a3_0/> John Gould announced that <a1_0>Darwin's rhea was a separate species from the previously described rhea<a1_0/> (though their territories overlapped), that mockingbirds collected on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands represented <a2_0>three separate species<a2_0/> each unique to a particular island, and that several distinct birds from those islands were all classified as finches. Darwin began speculating, in a series of notebooks, on the possibility that \"one species does change into another\" to explain these findings, and around July sketched a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, discarding Lamarck's independent lineages progressing to higher forms. Unconventionally, Darwin asked questions of fancy pigeon and animal breeders as well as established scientists. At the zoo he had his first sight of <a4_0>an ape<a4_0/>, and was profoundly impressed by how human the orangutan seemed."}
