Darwin discovered fossils resembling <a3_0>huge armadillos<a3_0/>, and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their \"centre of creation\". The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised, yet to Darwin <a4_0>their relatives on the island seemed \"miserable, degraded savages\"<a4_0/>, and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. As the Beagle neared England in 1836, he noted that species might not be fixed."}
