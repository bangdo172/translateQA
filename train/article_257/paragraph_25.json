Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding. As an illustration of artificial selection, he describes <a1_0>fancy pigeon breeding<a1_0/>, noting that \"[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing\", yet all were descended from <a2_0>one species of rock pigeon<a2_0/>. Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called \"sports\" or \"monstrosities\" (example: ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons). Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin <a3_0>the small changes<a3_0/> were most important in evolution."}
