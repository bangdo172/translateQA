The term \"mineral\" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply <a1_0>the less common elements in the diet<a1_0/>. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned, including several metals, which often occur as <a2_0>ions<a2_0/> in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as calcium carbonate from ground oyster shells). Some minerals are absorbed much more readily in the <a3_0>ionic forms<a3_0/> found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most famous is likely <a4_0>iodine<a4_0/> in iodized salt which prevents goiter."}
