As of <a4_0>2014<a4_0/>, nutrients are thought to be of two types: <a1_0>macro-nutrients<a1_0/> which are needed in relatively large amounts, and micronutrients which are needed in smaller quantities. A type of carbohydrate, dietary fiber, i.e. <a2_0>non-digestible<a2_0/> material such as cellulose, is required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, although the exact reasons remain unclear. Other micronutrients include antioxidants and <a3_0>phytochemicals<a3_0/>, which are said to influence (or protect) some body systems. Their necessity is not as well established as in the case of, for instance, vitamins."}
