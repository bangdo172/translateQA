However, the findings of the 2003 <a1_0>National Assessment of Adult Literacy<a1_0/> (NAAL) provide a basis upon which to frame the nutrition literacy problem in the U.S. NAAL introduced the first ever measure of \"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions\" \u2013 an objective of Healthy People 2010 and of which nutrition literacy might be considered an important subset. On a scale of below basic, basic, intermediate and proficient, NAAL found 13 percent of adult Americans have proficient health literacy, <a2_0>44%<a2_0/> have intermediate literacy, 29 percent have basic literacy and <a3_0>14<a3_0/> percent have below basic health literacy.
