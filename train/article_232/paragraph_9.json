In 1906, Edith G. Willcock and Frederick Hopkins showed that the amino acid <a2_0>tryptophan<a2_0/> aids the well-being of mice but it did not assure their growth. In the middle of twelve years of attempts to isolate them, Hopkins said in a 1906 lecture that \"<a3_0>unsuspected dietetic factors<a3_0/>,\" other than calories, protein, and minerals, are needed to prevent deficiency diseases.
