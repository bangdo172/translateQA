Inevitably, such large-scale concentration changes the <a1_0>nutritional content<a1_0/> of food, saving certain nutrients while removing others. Heating techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered substances. Because of <a2_0>reduced<a2_0/> nutritional value, processed foods are often '<a3_0>enriched<a3_0/>' or 'fortified' with some of the most critical nutrients (usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing. Nonetheless, processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole, fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, potassium/sodium, vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids. In addition, processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and <a4_0>trans fatty acids<a4_0/>."}
