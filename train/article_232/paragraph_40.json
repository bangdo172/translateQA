While a precise comparison between the NAAL and Delta studies is difficult, primarily because of <a1_0>methodological differences<a1_0/>, <a2_0>Zoellner<a2_0/> et al. suggest that health literacy rates in the Mississippi Delta region are different from the U.S. general population and that they help establish the scope of the problem of health literacy among adults in the Delta region. For example, only 12 percent of study participants identified the My Pyramid graphic <a3_0>two<a3_0/> years after it had been launched by the USDA. The study also found significant relationships between <a4_0>nutrition literacy<a4_0/> and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment further delineating priorities for the region."}
