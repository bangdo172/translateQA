There is little doubt that the increasingly <a0_0>widespread application of some modern food processing technologies<a0_0/> has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., <a1_0>nutritional recommendations<a1_0/>, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; <a2_0>effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life<a2_0/> is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally <a3_0>superior<a3_0/>, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, <a4_0>more convenient<a4_0/> (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications."}
