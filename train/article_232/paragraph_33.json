Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of <a2_0>photosynthesis<a2_0/>. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by <a3_0>cation exchange<a3_0/>, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, <a4_0>stomata<a4_0/> open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis."}
