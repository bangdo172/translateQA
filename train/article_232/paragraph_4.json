Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist <a2_0>Leonardo da Vinci<a2_0/> compared <a1_0>metabolism<a1_0/> to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject, but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen. Ultimately, 16th century works of Andreas Vesalius, sometimes called the father of modern medicine, overturned Galen's ideas. He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era's mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the mechanics of Newton and Galileo. Jan Baptist van Helmont, who discovered several gases such as <a3_0>carbon dioxide<a3_0/>, performed the first quantitative experiment. Robert Boyle advanced chemistry. Sanctorius measured body weight. Physician <a4_0>Herman Boerhaave<a4_0/> modeled the digestive process. Physiologist Albrecht von Haller worked out the difference between nerves and muscles."}
