In contrast, diseases of affluence like cancer and heart disease are common throughout the developed world, including the United States. Adjusted for age and exercise, large regional clusters of people in China rarely suffered from these \"Western\" diseases possibly because their diets are rich in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, and have little <a3_0>dairy<a3_0/> and meat products.
