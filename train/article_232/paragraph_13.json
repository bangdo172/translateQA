Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) to <a1_0>complex polysaccharides<a1_0/> (starch). Fats are <a2_0>triglycerides<a2_0/>, made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to a glycerol backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are essential in the diet: they <a3_0>cannot be synthesized in the body<a3_0/>. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are <a4_0>nitrogen<a4_0/>-containing amino acids, some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production, just as ordinary glucose, in a process known as gluconeogenesis. By breaking down existing protein, the carbon skeleton of the various amino acids can be metabolized to intermediates in cellular respiration; the remaining ammonia is discarded primarily as urea in urine. This occurs normally only during prolonged starvation."}
