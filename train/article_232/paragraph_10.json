Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Osborne also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919, Sir Edward Mellanby incorrectly identified <a3_0>rickets<a3_0/> as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil. In 1922, McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil, but found that it still cured rickets. Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discover <a4_0>vitamin E<a4_0/> as essential for rat pregnancy, originally calling it \"food factor X\" until 1925."}
