The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide <a1_0>structural material<a1_0/> (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and energy. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in <a2_0>Joules<a2_0/> or kilocalories (often called \"Calories\" and written with a capital C to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17 kJ approximately (4 kcal) of energy per gram, while <a3_0>fats<a3_0/> provide 37 kJ (9 kcal) per gram, though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not <a4_0>provide energy<a4_0/>, but are required for other reasons."}
