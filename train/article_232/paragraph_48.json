The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, as a result of high intake of strongly <a2_0>insulin/leptin<a2_0/> stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as <a3_0>satiety signals to the hypothalamus<a3_0/> in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may <a4_0>reduce this signal<a4_0/> and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores. In addition, reduced leptin signalling to the brain may reduce leptin's normal effect to maintain an appropriately high metabolic rate."}
