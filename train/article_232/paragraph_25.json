(<a0_0>Vitamin D<a0_0/> is the exception: it can be synthesized in the skin, in the presence of <a1_0>UVB radiation<a1_0/>.) Certain vitamin-like compounds that are recommended in the diet, such as <a2_0>carnitine<a2_0/>, are thought useful for survival and health, but these are not \"essential\" dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds. Moreover, thousands of different <a3_0>phytochemicals<a3_0/> have recently been discovered in food (particularly in fresh vegetables), which may have desirable properties including antioxidant activity (see below); however, experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive. Other essential nutrients that are not classified as <a4_0>vitamins<a4_0/> include essential amino acids (see above), choline, essential fatty acids (see above), and the minerals discussed in the preceding section."}
