However the notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source. The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the <a1_0>Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council<a1_0/> read: \"An ordinary standard for diverse persons is <a2_0>1 milliliter<a2_0/> for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.\" More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health. Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or <a3_0>adequate daily intakes<a3_0/> (ADI). These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with \u201cdesirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed.\u201d For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These reference values include water from drinking water, other beverages, and from food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink, with the remaining 20% coming from <a4_0>food<a4_0/>. Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed, with fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals, for example. These values are estimated using country-specific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Other guidelines for nutrition also have implications for the beverages we consume for healthy hydration- for example, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that added sugars should represent no more than 10% of total energy intake."}
