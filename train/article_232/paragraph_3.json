Galen was physician to gladiators in Pergamon, and in Rome, physician to <a1_0>Marcus Aurelius<a1_0/> and the three emperors who succeeded him. Most of Galen's teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by <a2_0>Benedictine monks<a2_0/> at the School of Salerno in Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum, which still had users in the 17th century. Galen believed in the bodily humours of Hippocrates, and he taught that pneuma is <a3_0>the source of life<a3_0/>. Four elements (earth, air, fire and water) combine into \"complexion\", which combines into states (the four temperaments: sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic). The states are made up of pairs of attributes (hot and moist, cold and moist, hot and dry, and cold and dry), which are made of <a4_0>four humours<a4_0/>: blood, phlegm, green (or yellow) bile, and black bile (the bodily form of the elements). Galen thought that for a person to have gout, kidney stones, or arthritis was scandalous, which Gratzer likens to Samuel Butler's Erehwon (1872) where sickness is a crime."}
