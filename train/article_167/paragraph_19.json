In comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the region, Jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north of the Fertile Crescent. The authors also report on Eu 19 (R1a) chromosomes, which are very frequent in Central and Eastern Europeans (<a1_0>54%\u201360%<a1_0/>) at elevated frequency (<a2_0>12.7%<a2_0/>) in Ashkenazi Jews. They hypothesized that the differences among Ashkenazim Jews could reflect <a3_0>low-level gene flow from surrounding European populations and/or genetic drift during isolation<a3_0/>. A later 2005 study by Nebel et al., found a similar level of 11.5% of male Ashkenazim belonging to R1a1a (M17+), the dominant Y-chromosome haplogroup in Central and Eastern Europeans."}
