This created opportunities for Jewish merchants to settle again <a1_0>north of the Alps<a1_0/>. Charlemagne granted the Jews freedoms similar to those once enjoyed under the <a2_0>Roman Empire<a2_0/>. In addition, Jews from southern Italy, fleeing religious persecution, began to move into central Europe.[citation needed] Returning to Frankish lands, many Jewish merchants took up occupations in <a3_0>finance and commerce<a3_0/>, including money lending, or usury. (Church legislation banned Christians from lending money in exchange for interest.) From Charlemagne's time to the present, Jewish life in northern Europe is well documented. By the 11th century, when Rashi of Troyes wrote his commentaries, Jews in what came to be known as \"Ashkenaz\" were known for their halakhic learning, and Talmudic studies. They were criticized by Sephardim and other Jewish scholars in Islamic lands for their lack of expertise in Jewish jurisprudence (dinim) and general ignorance of Hebrew linguistics and literature. <a4_0>Yiddish<a4_0/> emerged as a result of language contact with various High German vernaculars in the medieval period. It was written with Hebrew letters, and heavily influenced by Hebrew and Aramaic."}
