Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort \u2013 that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same <a1_0>ethnic group<a1_0/>. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of <a2_0>Hasidic or Hareidi sects<a2_0/>, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these <a3_0>Haredi Jews often have extremely large families<a3_0/>."}
