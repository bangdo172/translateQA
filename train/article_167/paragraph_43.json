Many Jews were denied full Roman citizenship until <a2_0>212 CE<a2_0/>, when <a3_0>Emperor Caracalla<a3_0/> granted all free peoples this privilege. Jews were required to pay a poll tax until the reign of Emperor Julian in 363. In the late Roman Empire, Jews were free to form networks of cultural and religious ties and enter into various local occupations. But, after Christianity became the official religion of Rome and Constantinople in 380, Jews were increasingly marginalized."}
