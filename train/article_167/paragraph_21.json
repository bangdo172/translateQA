The name of Gomer has often been linked to the ethnonym <a2_0>Cimmerians<a2_0/>. Biblical Ashkenaz is usually derived from Assyrian A\u0161k\u016bza (cuneiform A\u0161kuzai/I\u0161kuzai), a people who expelled the <a3_0>Cimmerians<a3_0/> from the Armenian area of the Upper Euphrates, whose name is usually associated with the name of the Scythians. The intrusive n in the Biblical name is likely due to a scribal error confusing a waw \u05d5 with a nun \u05e0."}
