Hammer et al. found that the Y-chromosome of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews contained mutations that are also common among <a0_0>Middle Eastern peoples<a0_0/>, but <a1_0>uncommon in the general European population<a1_0/>. This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to <a2_0>the Middle East<a2_0/>. The proportion of male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with \"relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim,\" and a total admixture estimate \"very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%.\" This supported the finding that \"Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.\" \"Past research found that 50\u201380 percent of DNA from the Ashkenazi Y chromosome, which is used to trace the male lineage, originated in the Near East,\" Richards said."}
