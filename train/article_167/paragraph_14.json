Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations. On certain issues, <a4_0>Orthodox Jews<a4_0/> are required to follow the customs of their ancestors, and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past. In this sense, \"Ashkenazic\" refers both to <a2_0>a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry<a2_0/>. Reform Judaism, which does not necessarily follow those minhagim, did nonetheless originate among <a3_0>Ashkenazi Jews<a3_0/>."}
