The creation of new scientific constructs during <a3_0><b7_0>the scientific revolution<b7_0/><a3_0/>, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the <a1_0><b6_0>autonomy<b6_0/><a1_0/> of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines. Instead of entering higher education to become a \"general scholar\" immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum, there emerged a type of scholar that put science <a4_0><b8_0>first<b8_0/><a4_0/> and viewed it as a vocation in itself.
