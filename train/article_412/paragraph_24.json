In fact, <a0_0><b5_0>more than 80%<b5_0/><a0_0/> of the European scientists between 1450\u20131650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts. It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was <a1_0>considerable reluctance<a1_0/> on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at <a2_0><b6_0>University of Wittenberg<b6_0/><a2_0/> were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction. Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of <a3_0><b7_0>Cartesian<b7_0/><a3_0/> epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities. Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey <a4_0>legitimacy and respectability<a4_0/>, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources."}
