The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate (as the notable list of scholars above attests to). A focus on knowledge coming from self, from the human, has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction, and was the foundation for what is commonly known as <a1_0><b5_0>the humanities<b5_0/><a1_0/>. This <b8_0>disposition toward knowledge<b8_0/> manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts, but also their adaptation and expansion. For instance, Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of <a2_0><b6_0>Galen<b6_0/><a2_0/>, but he also invigorated this text with experimentation, disagreements and further research. The propagation of these texts, especially within the universities, was greatly aided by the emergence of <a3_0><b7_0>the printing press<b7_0/><a3_0/> and the beginning of the use of the vernacular, which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices."}
