On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the <a1_0>self/nonself distinction<a1_0/>: \"self\" constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while <a2_0>\"nonself\" entities (e.g., pathogens, an allograft)<a2_0/> trigger a destructive immune response. The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or <a3_0>the complex \"two-signal\" activation<a3_0/> of T cells. The self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, but remain very influential."}
