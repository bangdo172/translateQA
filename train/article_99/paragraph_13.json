The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between <a1_0>\"cellular\" and \"humoral\"<a1_0/> theories of immunity. According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff, it was cells \u2013 more precisely, <a2_0>phagocytes<a2_0/> \u2013 that were responsible for immune responses. In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, among others, stated that the active immune agents were <a3_0>soluble components (molecules)<a3_0/> found in <a4_0>the organism\u2019s \u201chumors\u201d<a4_0/> rather than its cells."}
