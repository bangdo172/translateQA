It also has two different parts: Part I is <a0_0>an introduction to the basic principles of immunology<a0_0/> and Part II is a <a1_0>clinically-oriented lecture series<a1_0/>. On the other hand, the Advanced Course is another course for those who are willing to expand or update their understanding of immunology. It is advised for students who want to attend the Advanced Course to have <a2_0>a background of the principles of immunology<a2_0/>. Most schools require students to take electives in other to complete their degrees. A Master\u2019s degree requires <a3_0>two years of study<a3_0/> following the attainment of a bachelor's degree.
