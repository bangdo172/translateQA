At birth, most of the immunoglobulin present is maternal IgG. Because IgM, IgD, IgE and IgA don\u2019t cross the placenta, they are almost undetectable at birth. Some IgA is provided by <a1_0>breast milk<a1_0/>. These passively-acquired antibodies can protect the newborn for <a2_0>up to 18 months<a2_0/>, but their response is usually short-lived and of low affinity. These antibodies can also produce a negative response. If a child is exposed to the antibody for a particular antigen before being exposed to the antigen itself then the child will produce a dampened response. Passively acquired maternal antibodies can suppress the antibody response to active immunization. Similarly the response of T-cells to vaccination differs in children compared to adults, and vaccines that induce Th1 responses in adults do not readily elicit these same responses in neonates. Between six to nine months after birth, a child\u2019s immune system begins to respond more strongly to <a3_0>glycoproteins<a3_0/>, but there is usually no marked improvement in their response to polysaccharides until they are at least one year old. This can be the reason for <a4_0>distinct time frames found in vaccination schedules<a4_0/>."}
