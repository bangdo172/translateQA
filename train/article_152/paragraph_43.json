Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station study the <b5_0>celestial dome and cosmic microwave background radiation<b5_0/>. Many <a3_0>astronomical<a3_0/> observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations <b7_0>because of the high elevation<b7_0/>, which results in a thin atmosphere; low temperature, which minimizes the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere; and absence of light pollution, thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth.
