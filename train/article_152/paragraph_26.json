This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of <a1_0>ice<a1_0/>. Precipitation is low (most of <b6_0>Antarctica<b6_0/> is a desert) and almost always in the form of <a2_0>snow<a2_0/>, which accumulates and forms a <a3_0>giant ice sheet<a3_0/> which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving <a4_0>glaciers<a4_0/> known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many <b7_0>ice shelves.<b7_0/> These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also <b8_0>low<b8_0/> enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling."}
