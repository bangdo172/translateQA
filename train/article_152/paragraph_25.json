In 1969, <b7_0>a <a3_0>Japanese<a3_0/> expedition discovered <b8_0>nine<b8_0/> meteorites<b7_0/>. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall.
