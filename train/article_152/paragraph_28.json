A study by <b5_0>Eric Steig<b5_0/> published in 2009 noted for the first time that <b6_0>the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 \u00b0C<b6_0/> (0.09 \u00b0F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica <b7_0>has warmed by more than <a1_0>0.1 \u00b0C<a1_0/> (0.2 \u00b0F) per decade in the last 50 years<b7_0/>, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by <b8_0>autumn cooling<b8_0/> in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human <a2_0>carbon dioxide emissions<a2_0/>, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an <a3_0>inflow of warm water<a3_0/> from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater <a4_0>atmospheric warming<a4_0/> there."}
