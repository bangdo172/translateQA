In <a2_0><b7_0>1988<b7_0/><a2_0/>, the <b6_0>Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources<b6_0/> (CRAMRA) was adopted. The following year, however, <a3_0><b8_0>Australia and France<b8_0/><a3_0/> announced that they would not ratify the convention, rendering it dead for all intents and purposes. They proposed instead that a comprehensive regime to protect the Antarctic environment be negotiated in its place. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the <b9_0>Antarctic Treaty<b9_0/> (the \"<a4_0>Madrid Protocol<a4_0/>\") was negotiated as other countries followed suit and on 14 January 1998 it entered into force. The Madrid Protocol bans all mining in Antarctica, designating Antarctica a \"natural reserve devoted to peace and science\"."}
