By the start of the <b11_0>Devonian period<b11_0/> (416 Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was <a3_0>cooler<a3_0/>, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. <b13_0>Glaciation<b13_0/> began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), as Gondwana became centered on the <a4_0>South Pole<a4_0/> and the climate cooled, though flora remained.

Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains. Towards the <b9_0>end of the Permian period<b9_0/>, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana."}
