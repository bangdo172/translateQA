The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a <a1_0>criminal<a1_0/> penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of <a2_0>krill<a2_0/>, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the <b7_0>Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources<b7_0/> (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in <a4_0><b8_0>1980<b8_0/><a4_0/>, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem.
