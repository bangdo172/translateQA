Ozone absorbs large amounts of <a1_0>ultraviolet radiation<a1_0/> in the stratosphere. <b6_0>Ozone depletion<b6_0/> over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around <a2_0>6 \u00b0C<a2_0/> in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the <b7_0>westerly winds which flow around the continent<b7_0/> (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote <a3_0>accelerated melting<a3_0/>. Models also suggest that the <b8_0>ozone depletion<b8_0/>/<a4_0>enhanced polar vortex<a4_0/> effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent."}
