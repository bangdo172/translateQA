Large numbers of his coins have been found in India, and he seems to have reigned in Gandhara as well as western Punjab. Apollodotus I was succeeded by or ruled alongside <a1_0>Antimachus II<a1_0/>, likely the son of the Bactrian king Antimachus I. In about 155 (or 165) BC he seems to have been succeeded by the most successful of the Indo-Greek kings, <a2_0>Menander I<a2_0/>. Menander converted to <a3_0>Buddhism<a3_0/>, and seems to have been a great patron of the religion; he is remembered in some Buddhist texts as '<a4_0>Milinda<a4_0/>'. He also expanded the kingdom further east into Punjab, though these conquests were rather ephemeral."}
