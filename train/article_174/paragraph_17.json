One example is Athens, which had been decisively defeated by Antipater in the Lamian war (<a0_0>323-322<a0_0/>) and had its port in the Piraeus garrisoned by Macedonian troops who supported a conservative oligarchy. After Demetrius Poliorcetes captured Athens in <a1_0>307<a1_0/> and restored the democracy, the Athenians honored him and his father <a2_0>Antigonus<a2_0/> by placing gold statues of them on the agora and granting them the title of king. Athens later allied itself to <a3_0>Ptolemaic Egypt<a3_0/> to throw off Macedonian rule, eventually setting up a religious cult for the Ptolemaic kings and naming one of the city phyles in honor of Ptolemy for his aid against Macedon. In spite of the Ptolemaic monies and fleets backing their endeavors, Athens and Sparta were defeated by Antigonus II during the Chremonidean War (<a4_0>267-61<a4_0/>). Athens was then occupied by Macedonian troops, and run by Macedonian officials."}
