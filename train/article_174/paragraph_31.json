Ptolemy himself was eager to patronise the library, scientific research and individual scholars who lived on the grounds of the library. He and his successors also fought a series of wars with <a0_0>the Seleucids<a0_0/>, known as the Syrian wars, over the region of <a1_0>Coele-Syria<a1_0/>. <a2_0>Ptolemy IV<a2_0/> won the great battle of Raphia (<a3_0>217 BCE<a3_0/>) against the <a4_0>Seleucids<a4_0/>, using native Egyptians trained as phalangites. However these Egyptian soldiers revolted, eventually setting up a native breakaway Egyptian state in the Thebaid between 205-186/5 BCE, severely weakening the Ptolemaic state."}
