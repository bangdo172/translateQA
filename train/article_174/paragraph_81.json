Especially important to Hellenistic science was the city of <a1_0>Alexandria<a1_0/> in Egypt, which became a major center of scientific research in the <a2_0>3rd<a2_0/> century BC. Hellenistic scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations."}
