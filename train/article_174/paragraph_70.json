Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to <a0_0>Greek<a0_0/> culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for <a1_0>Greeks<a1_0/> only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore <a2_0>highly localized<a2_0/> and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid empire for example, this group amounted to only <a3_0>2.5<a3_0/> percent of the official class."}
