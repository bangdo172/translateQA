These federations involved a central government which controlled foreign policy and military affairs, while leaving most of the local governing to the city states, a system termed <a3_0>sympoliteia<a3_0/>. In states such as the Achaean league, this also involved the admission of other ethnic groups into the federation with equal rights, in this case, non-Achaeans. The <a4_0>Achean<a4_0/> league was able to drive out the Macedonians from the Peloponnese and free Corinth, which duly joined the league."}
