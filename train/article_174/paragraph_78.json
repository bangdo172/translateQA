The scholars at the libraries in Alexandria and Pergamon focused on the collection, cataloging, and literary criticism of classical Athenian works and ancient Greek myths. The poet-critic <a1_0><a2_0>Callimachus<a2_0/><a1_0/>, a staunch elitist, wrote hymns equating Ptolemy II to Zeus and Apollo. He promoted short poetic forms such as the epigram, epyllion and the iambic and attacked epic as base and common (\"big book, big evil\" was his doctrine). He also wrote a massive catalog of the holdings of the library of Alexandria, the famous <a3_0>Pinakes<a3_0/>. Callimachus was extremely influential in his time and also for the development of Augustan poetry. Another poet, <a4_0>Apollonius of Rhodes<a4_0/>, attempted to revive the epic for the Hellenistic world with his Argonautica. He had been a student of Callimachus and later became chief librarian (prostates) of the library of Alexandria, Apollonius and Callimachus spent much of their careers feuding with each other. Pastoral poetry also thrived during the Hellenistic era, Theocritus was a major poet who popularized the genre."}
