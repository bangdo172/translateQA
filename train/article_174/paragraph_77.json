Only one play, <a1_0>Dyskolos<a1_0/>, survives in its entirety. The plots of this new Hellenistic comedy of manners were more domestic and formulaic, stereotypical low born characters such as slaves became more important, the language was colloquial and major motifs included escapism, marriage, romance and luck (Tyche). Though no Hellenistic tragedy remains intact, they were still widely produced during the period, yet it seems that there was no major breakthrough in style, remaining within the classical model. <a2_0>The Supplementum Hellenisticum<a2_0/>, a modern collection of extant fragments, contains the fragments of 150 authors."}
