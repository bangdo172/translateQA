The Seleucid\u2013Parthian wars continued as the Seleucids invaded Mesopotamia under <a0_0>Antiochus VII Sidetes<a0_0/> (r. 138\u2013129 BC), but he was eventually killed by a <a1_0>Parthian<a1_0/> counterattack. After the fall of the Seleucid dynasty, the Parthians fought frequently against neighbouring Rome in the Roman\u2013Parthian Wars (<a2_0>66 BC \u2013 217 AD<a2_0/>). Abundant traces of Hellenism continued under the Parthian empire. The Parthians used Greek as well as their own Parthian language (though lesser than Greek) as languages of administration and also used <a3_0>Greek drachmas<a3_0/> as coinage. They enjoyed Greek theater and Greek art influenced Parthian art. The Parthians continued worhipping Greek gods syncretized together with <a4_0>Iranian<a4_0/> deities. Their rulers established ruler cults in the manner of Hellenistic kings and often used Hellenistic royal epithets."}
