However the socio-political changes brought on by the conquest of the Persian empire and Greek emigration abroad meant that change also came to religious practices. This varied greatly on location, Athens, Sparta and most cities in the Greek mainland did not see much religious change or new gods (with the exception of the Egyptian <a0_0>Isis<a0_0/> in Athens), while the multi-ethnic Alexandria had a very varied group of gods and religious practices, including Egyptian, Jewish and Greek. Greek emigres brought their Greek religion everywhere they went, even as far as India and Afghanistan. Non-Greeks also had more freedom to travel and trade throughout the Mediterranean and in this period we can see Egyptian gods such as Serapis, and the Syrian gods Atargatis and Hadad, as well as a Jewish synagogue, all coexisting on the island of Delos alongside classical Greek deities. A common practice was to identify Greek gods with native gods that had similar characteristics and this created new fusions like Zeus-<a1_0>Ammon<a1_0/>, Aphrodite <a2_0>Hagne<a2_0/> (a Hellenized Atargatis) and Isis-<a3_0>Demeter<a3_0/>. Greek emigres faced individual religious choices they had not faced on their home cities, where the gods they worshiped were dictated by tradition."}
