The rise of philosophy and the sciences had removed the gods from many of their traditional domains such as their role in the movement of the heavenly bodies and natural disasters. The <a1_0>Sophists<a1_0/> proclaimed the centrality of humanity and agnosticism; the belief in <a2_0>Euhemerism<a2_0/> (the view that the gods were simply ancient kings and heroes), became popular. The popular philosopher <a3_0>Epicurus<a3_0/> promoted a view of disinterested gods living far away from the human realm in metakosmia. The apotheosis of rulers also brought the idea of divinity <a4_0>down to earth<a4_0/>. While there does seem to have been a substantial decline in religiosity, this was mostly reserved for the educated classes."}
