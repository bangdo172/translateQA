While it may have been a deliberate attempt to spread Greek culture (or as Arrian says, \"to civilise the natives\"), it is more likely that it was a series of pragmatic measures designed to aid in the rule of his enormous empire. Cities and colonies were centers of administrative control and Macedonian power in a newly conquered region. Alexander also seems to have attempted to create a mixed Greco-Persian elite class as shown by the Susa weddings and his adoption of some forms of <a1_0>Persian<a1_0/> dress and court culture. He also brought in Persian and other non-Greek peoples into his military and even the elite cavalry units of the companion cavalry. Again, it is probably better to see these policies as a pragmatic response to the demands of ruling a large empire than to any idealized attempt to bringing Greek culture to the 'barbarians'. This approach was bitterly resented by <a2_0>the Macedonians<a2_0/> and discarded by most of the Diadochi after Alexander's death. These policies can also be interpreted as the result of Alexander's possible <a3_0>megalomania<a3_0/> during his later years."}
