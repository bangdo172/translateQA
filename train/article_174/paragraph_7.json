After the Peloponnesian War (<a0_0>431\u2013404 BC<a0_0/>), Greece had fallen under a Spartan hegemony, in which Sparta was pre-eminent but not all-powerful. Spartan hegemony was succeeded by a <a1_0>Theban<a1_0/> one after the Battle of Leuctra (<a2_0>371 BC<a2_0/>), but after the Battle of Mantinea (<a3_0>362 BC<a3_0/>), all of Greece was so weakened that no one state could claim pre-eminence. It was against this backdrop, that the ascendancy of Macedon began, under king <a4_0>Philip II<a4_0/>. Macedon was located at the periphery of the Greek world, and although its royal family claimed Greek descent, the Macedonians themselves were looked down upon as semi-barbaric by the rest of the Greeks. However, Macedon had a relatively strong and centralised government, and compared to most Greek states, directly controlled a large area."}
