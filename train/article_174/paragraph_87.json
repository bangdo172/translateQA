Hellenistic-era warships grew from the trireme to include more banks of oars and larger numbers of rowers and soldiers as in the Quadrireme and Quinquereme. The <a0_0>Ptolemaic Tessarakonteres<a0_0/> was the largest ship constructed in Antiquity. New siege engines were developed during this period. An unknown engineer developed the torsion-spring catapult (ca. 360) and <a1_0>Dionysios of Alexandria<a1_0/> designed a repeating <a2_0>ballista<a2_0/>, the Polybolos. Preserved examples of ball projectiles range from 4.4 kg to 78 kg (or over 170 lbs). Demetrius Poliorcetes was notorious for the large siege engines employed in his campaigns, especially during the <a4_0>12-month<a4_0/> siege of Rhodes when he had Epimachos of Athens build a massive <a3_0>160 ton<a3_0/> siege tower named Helepolis, filled with artillery."}
