Under the Hellenistic kingdoms, Judea was ruled by the hereditary office of the <a1_0>High Priest of Israel<a1_0/> as a Hellenistic vassal. This period also saw the rise of a Hellenistic <a2_0>Judaism<a2_0/>, which first developed in the Jewish diaspora of Alexandria and <a3_0>Antioch<a3_0/>, and then spread to Judea. The major literary product of this cultural syncretism is the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible from Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic to Koin\u00e9 Greek. The reason for the production of this translation seems to be that many of the Alexandrian Jews had lost the ability to speak Hebrew and Aramaic."}
