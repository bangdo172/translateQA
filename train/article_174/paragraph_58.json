This Roman-Greek interaction began as a consequence of the Greek city-states located along the coast of southern Italy. Rome had come to dominate the <a0_0>Italian<a0_0/> peninsula, and desired the submission of the Greek cities to its rule. Although they initially resisted, allying themselves with Pyrrhus of Epirus, and defeating the Romans at several battles, the Greek cities were unable to maintain this position and were absorbed by the <a1_0>Roman<a1_0/> republic. Shortly afterwards, Rome became involved in Sicily, fighting against the Carthaginians in the <a2_0>First Punic War<a2_0/>. The end result was the complete conquest of Sicily, including its previously powerful Greek cities, by the <a3_0>Romans<a3_0/>."}
