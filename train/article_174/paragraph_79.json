However Athens had now lost her political freedom and Hellenistic philosophy is a reflection of this new difficult period. In this political climate, Hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as ataraxia (<a1_0>un-disturbedness<a1_0/>), autarky (<a2_0>self-sufficiency<a2_0/>) and apatheia (<a3_0>freedom from suffering<a3_0/>), which would allow them to wrest well-being or eudaimonia out of the most difficult turns of fortune. This occupation with the inner life, with personal inner liberty and with the pursuit of eudaimonia is what all Hellenistic philosophical schools have in common."}
