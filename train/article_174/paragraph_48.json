Out of this revolt was formed an independent Jewish kingdom known as the <a0_0>Hasmonaean Dynasty<a0_0/>, which lasted from <a1_0>165 BCE to 63 BCE<a1_0/>. The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated in a civil war, which coincided with civil wars in Rome. The last Hasmonean ruler, <a2_0>Antigonus II Mattathias<a2_0/>, was captured by <a3_0>Herod<a3_0/> and executed in <a4_0>37 BCE<a4_0/>. In spite of originally being a revolt against Greek overlordship, the Hasmonean kingdom and also the Herodian kingdom which followed gradually became more and more hellenized. From 37 BCE to 6 CE, the Herodian dynasty, Jewish-Roman client kings, ruled Judea. Herod the Great considerably enlarged the Temple (see Herod's Temple), making it one of the largest religious structures in the world. The style of the enlarged temple and other Herodian architecture shows significant Hellenistic architectural influence."}
