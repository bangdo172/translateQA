Artists such as <a0_0>Peiraikos<a0_0/> chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings. According to Pliny, \"He painted barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects, earning for himself the name of rhyparographos [painter of dirt/low things]. In these subjects he could give consummate pleasure, selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures\" (Natural History, Book XXXV.112). Even barbarians, such as the <a1_0>Galatians<a1_0/>, were depicted in heroic form, prefiguring the artistic theme of the noble savage. The image of <a2_0>Alexander the Great<a2_0/> was also an important artistic theme, and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating Alexander's youthful look. A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to the <a3_0>Hellenistic<a3_0/> period, including Laoco\u00f6n and his Sons, Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace."}
