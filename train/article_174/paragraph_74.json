These cults were usually associated with a specific temple in honor of the ruler such as the Ptolemaieia at Alexandria and had their own festivals and theatrical performances. The setting up of ruler cults was more based on the systematized honors offered to the kings (sacrifice, proskynesis, statues, altars, hymns) which put them on par with the gods (<a1_0>isotheism<a1_0/>) than on actual belief of their divine nature. According to Peter Green, these cults did not produce genuine belief of the divinity of rulers among the Greeks and Macedonians. The worship of <a2_0>Alexander<a2_0/> was also popular, as in the long lived cult at Erythrae and of course, at <a3_0>Alexandria<a3_0/>, where his tomb was located."}
