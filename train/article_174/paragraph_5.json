The works of the major Hellenistic historians Hieronymus of Cardia (who worked under Alexander, Antigonus I and other successors), Duris of Samos and Phylarchus which were used by surviving sources are all lost. The earliest and most credible surviving source for the Hellenistic period is <a0_0>Polybius<a0_0/> of <a1_0>Megalopolis<a1_0/> (c. 200-118), a statesman of the <a4_0>Achaean<a4_0/> League until 168 BCE when he was forced to go to <a2_0>Rome<a2_0/> as a hostage. His Histories eventually grew to a length of forty books, covering the years <a3_0>220 to 167 BCE<a3_0/>."}
