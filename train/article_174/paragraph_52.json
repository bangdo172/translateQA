This inevitably weakened the Greek position, and territory seems to have been lost progressively. Around 70 BC, the western regions of Arachosia and <a2_0>Paropamisadae<a2_0/> were lost to tribal <a3_0>in<a3_0/>vasions, presumably by those tribes responsible for the end of the Bactrian kingdom. The resulting <a1_0>Indo-Scythian<a1_0/> kingdom seems to have gradually pushed the remaining Indo-Greek kingdom towards the east. The Indo-Greek kingdom appears to have lingered on in western Punjab until about 10 AD when finally ended by the Indo-Scythians."}
