The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter <a2_0>Zeuxis<a2_0/>, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the <a4_0>Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles<a4_0/> and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos).
