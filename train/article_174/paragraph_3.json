Although words related in form or meaning, e.g. Hellenist (Ancient Greek: \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, Hell\u0113nist\u0113s), have been attested since ancient times, it was <a0_0>J. G. Droysen<a0_0/> in the mid-19th century, who in his classic work Geschichte des Hellenismus, i.e. <a1_0>History of Hellenism<a1_0/>, coined the term Hellenistic to refer to and define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander\u2019s conquest. Following Droysen, Hellenistic and related terms, e.g. Hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in Culture and Anarchy by <a2_0>Matthew Arnold<a2_0/>, where <a4_0>Hellenism<a4_0/> is used in contrast with Hebraism."}
