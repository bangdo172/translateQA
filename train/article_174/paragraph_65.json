The states of the Hellenistic period were deeply fixated with the past and its seemingly lost glories. The preservation of many classical and archaic works of art and literature (including the works of the three great classical tragedians, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides) are due to the efforts of the <a0_0>Hellenistic Greeks<a0_0/>. The museum and library of <a1_0>Alexandria<a1_0/> was the center of this conservationist activity. With the support of royal stipends, Alexandrian scholars collected, translated, copied, classified and critiqued every book they could find. Most of the great literary figures of the Hellenistic period studied at <a2_0>Alexandria<a2_0/> and conducted research there. They were scholar poets, writing not only poetry but treatises on Homer and other archaic and classical Greek literature."}
