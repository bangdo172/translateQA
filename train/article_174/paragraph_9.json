After the infantry stormed the palace of Babylon, a compromise was arranged \u2013 Arrhidaeus (as Philip III) should become king, and should rule jointly with Roxana's child, assuming that it was a boy (as it was, becoming Alexander IV). Perdiccas himself would become regent (epimeletes) of the empire, and Meleager his lieutenant. Soon, however, <a2_0>Perdiccas<a2_0/> had Meleager and the other infantry leaders murdered, and assumed full control. The generals who had supported Perdiccas were rewarded in the partition of <a3_0>Babylon<a3_0/> by becoming satraps of the various parts of the empire, but Perdiccas' position was shaky, because, as <a4_0>Arrian<a4_0/> writes, \"everyone was suspicious of him, and he of them\"."}
