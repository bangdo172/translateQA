Many cities maintained nominal autonomy while under the rule of the local king or satrap, and often had Greek-style institutions. Greek dedications, statues, architecture and inscriptions have all been found. However, local cultures were not replaced, and mostly went on as before, but now with a new Greco-Macedonian or otherwise Hellenized elite. An example that shows the spread of Greek theater is <a1_0>Plutarch<a1_0/>'s story of the death of Crassus, in which his head was taken to the Parthian court and used as a prop in a performance of <a2_0>The Bacchae<a2_0/>. Theaters have also been found: for example, in <a3_0>Ai-Khanoum<a3_0/> on the edge of Bactria, the theater has 35 rows \u2013 larger than the theater in Babylon."}
