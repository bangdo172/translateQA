They were defeated by Seleucus I in the '<a1_0>battle of the Elephants<a1_0/>', but were still able to establish a Celtic territory in central Anatolia. The Galatians were well respected as warriors and were widely used as mercenaries in the armies of the successor states. They continued to attack neighboring kingdoms such as Bithynia and Pergamon, plundering and extracting tribute. This came to an end when they sided with the renegade Seleucid prince Antiochus Hierax who tried to defeat Attalus, the ruler of Pergamon (241\u2013197 BC). Attalus severely defeated the Gauls, forcing them to confine themselves to Galatia. The theme of the <a2_0>Dying Gaul<a2_0/> (a famous statue displayed in Pergamon) remained a favorite in Hellenistic art for a generation signifying the victory of the Greeks over a noble enemy. In the early <a3_0>2nd century BC<a3_0/>, the Galatians became allies of Antiochus the Great, the last Seleucid king trying to regain suzerainty over Asia Minor. In 189 BC, <a4_0>Rome<a4_0/> sent Gnaeus Manlius Vulso on an expedition against the Galatians. Galatia was henceforth dominated by Rome through regional rulers from 189 BC onward."}
