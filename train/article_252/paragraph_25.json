Their signature piece is the \"Carnival Tango\", alternating comical and serious repertory. <a4_0>The comparsas<a4_0/> are the serious counterpart of the chirigota in C\u00e1diz, and the poetic lyrics and the criticism are their main ingredients. They have a more elaborated polyphony that is easily recognizable by the typical countertenor voice."}
