Calypso music, originating in <a1_0>Trinidad<a1_0/>, uses syncopated rhythm and topical lyrics. It offers a medium in which to satirise local politics, amidst the general bacchanal. Calypso tents, also originating in Trinidad, feature cadres of <a2_0>musicians<a2_0/> who perform biting social commentaries, political expos\u00e9s or rousing exhortations to \"wuk dah waistline\" and \"roll dat bumper\". The groups compete for <a3_0>the Calypso Monarch Award<a3_0/>, while the air is redolent with the smells of Bajan cooking during the Bridgetown Market Street Fair. The Cohobblopot Festival blends dance, drama and music with the crowning of the King and Queen of costume bands. Every evening the \"Pic-o-de-Crop\" Show is performed after the King of Calypso is finally crowned. The climax of the festival is <a4_0>Kadooment Day<a4_0/> celebrated with a national holiday when costume bands fill the streets with pulsating Barbadian rhythms and fireworks."}
