Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian\u2013Alemannic Fastnacht. However, <a0_0>evidence<a0_0/> is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of <a1_0>Saturnalia<a1_0/> survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people <a2_0>with their deaths<a2_0/>. In the case of Jesus, the gift is eternal life in heaven and in the case of King Carnival, the <a3_0>acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life<a3_0/>. Besides Christian anti-Judaism, the commonalities between church and Carnival rituals and imagery suggest a common root. Christ's passion is itself grotesque: Since early Christianity Christ is figured as the victim of summary judgement, is tortured and executed by Romans before a Jewish mob (\"His blood is on us and on our children!\" Matthew 27:24\u201325). Holy Week processions in Spain include crowds who vociferously insult the figure of Jesus. Irreverence, parody, degradation and laughter at a tragicomic effigy God can be seen as intensifications of the sacred order. In 1466, the Catholic Church under Pope Paul II revieved customs of the Saturnalia carnival: <a4_0>Jews<a4_0/> were forced to race naked through the streets of the city of Rome. \u201cBefore they were to run, the Jews were richly fed, so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators. They ran\u2026 amid Rome\u2019s taunting shrieks and peals of laughter, while the Holy Father stood upon a richly ornamented balcony and laughed heartily\u201d, an eyewitness reports."}
