Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. <a0_0>Perching birds<a0_0/> have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost <a1_0>in trees<a1_0/>. A few parrots of the genus <a2_0>Loriculus<a2_0/> roost hanging upside down. <a3_0>Some hummingbirds<a3_0/> go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have <a4_0>sweat<a4_0/> glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves."}
