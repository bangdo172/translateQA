While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. <a1_0>Forest birds<a1_0/> may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. <a0_0>Aquatic birds<a0_0/> generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. <a2_0>Birds of prey<a2_0/> specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers.
