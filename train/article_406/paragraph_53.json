Female offspring rarely stay at home, dispersing over distances that allow them to breed independently, or to join unrelated groups. In general, inbreeding is avoided <a2_0>because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness<a2_0/> (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles. <a1_0>Cross-fertilization between unrelated individuals<a1_0/> ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny."}
