Some birds have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the M\u0101ori's legendary <a1_0>Pou\u0101kai<a1_0/>, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. Birds were later used as symbols of power, as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors. With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books. Among the most famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose paintings of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the <a2_0>National Audubon Society<a2_0/>. Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated <a3_0>nightingales<a3_0/> into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2. The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's <a4_0>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner<a4_0/>, which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a 'burden'. Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture."}
