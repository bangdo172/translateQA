In some species, other members of the same species\u2014usually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods\u2014will help with the raising of the young. Such alloparenting is particularly common among the <a0_0><a1_0>Corvida<a1_0/><a0_0/>, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite. Among most groups of animals, <a2_0>male parental care<a2_0/> is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common\u2014more so than in any other vertebrate class. Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty."}
