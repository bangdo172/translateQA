Most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; <a3_0>albatross<a3_0/> nests are no more than a scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds\u2014which are more capable of defence\u2014may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation. Some bird species have no nests; the <a1_0>cliff-nesting common guillemot<a1_0/> lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs <a2_0>between their body and feet<a2_0/>. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial."}
