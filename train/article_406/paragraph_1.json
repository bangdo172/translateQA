True birds first appeared during the <a1_0>Cretaceous period<a1_0/>, around 100 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs. Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period. Many of these early \"stem-birds\", such as <a2_0>Archaeopteryx<a2_0/>, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails."}
