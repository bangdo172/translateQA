The most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis, New World vultures and tubenoses. The avian visual system is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual fovea. Birds are tetrachromatic, <a1_0>possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones<a1_0/>. This allows them to perceive ultraviolet light, which is involved in <a2_0>courtship<a2_0/>. Birds have specialized light-sensing cells deep in their brains that respond to light without input from eyes or other sensory neurons. These <a3_0>photo-receptive cells in<a3_0/> the hypothalamus are involved in detecting the longer days of spring, and thus regulate breeding activities."}
