Many groups retained primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as <a1_0>Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis<a1_0/>, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened with the advent of the pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia. In the <a2_0>late Cretaceous<a2_0/>, <a3_0>around 95 million years ago<a3_0/>, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell."}
