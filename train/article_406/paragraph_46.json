In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through <a2_0>brood patches<a2_0/>, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from <a3_0>10 days<a3_0/> (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to <a4_0>over 80 days<a4_0/> (in albatrosses and kiwis)."}
