The principal benefits of flocking are <a0_0>safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency<a0_0/>. <a2_0>Defence against predators<a2_0/> is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This has led to the development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources. Costs of flocking include <a1_0>bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds<a1_0/> and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases."}
