Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For <a0_0>diurnal migrants<a0_0/>, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an <a2_0>internal clock<a2_0/>. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris. These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense <a1_0>the Earth's geomagnetism<a1_0/> through specialised photoreceptors."}
