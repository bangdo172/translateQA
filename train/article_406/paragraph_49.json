The <a0_0>chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets<a0_0/>, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as <a1_0>ducks<a1_0/>, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest <a2_0>just before, or soon after, they are able to fly<a2_0/>. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging. Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration."}
