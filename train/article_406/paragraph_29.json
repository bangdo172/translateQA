Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, <a2_0>two<a2_0/> large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for <a3_0>15%<a3_0/> of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About <a4_0>60<a4_0/> extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \"fly\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers."}
