The <a0_0>digestive and respiratory systems<a0_0/> of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly the aforementioned flightless penguins, and also members of the duck family, have also evolved for swimming. Birds, specifically <a1_0>Darwin's finches<a1_0/>, played an important part in the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection."}
