Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of <a0_0>birds<a0_0/>, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest <a2_0>the assignment of orders is accurate<a2_0/>, but scientists disagree about the <a1_0>relationships between the orders themselves<a1_0/>; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders. The most recent effort is drawn above and is based on whole genome sequencing of 48 representative species."}
