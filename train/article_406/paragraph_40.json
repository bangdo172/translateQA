Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as <a0_0>vigilant sleep<a0_0/>, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening \"peeks\", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats. <a1_0>Swifts<a1_0/> are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight. It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight. Some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals. Communal roosting is common <a2_0>because it lowers the loss of body heat<a2_0/> and decreases the risks associated with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety."}
