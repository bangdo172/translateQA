These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. <a0_0>Before migration<a0_0/>, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs. Migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling. Landbirds have a flight range of around <a1_0>2,500 km (1,600 mi)<a1_0/> and shorebirds can fly up to <a2_0>4,000 km (2,500 mi)<a2_0/>, although the <a3_0>bar-tailed godwit<a3_0/> is capable of non-stop flights of up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi). Seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters, which nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of 64,000 km (39,800 mi). Other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route. <a4_0>Albatrosses nesting in the Southern Ocean<a4_0/> often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons."}
