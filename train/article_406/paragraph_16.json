The highest bird diversity occurs in <a1_0>tropical<a1_0/> regions. It was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics, however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics. Several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world's oceans and in them, with some seabird species coming ashore only <a3_0>to breed<a3_0/> and some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres (<a2_0>980<a2_0/> ft)."}
