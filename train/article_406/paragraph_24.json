Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging\u2014kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The <a0_0>nictitating membrane<a0_0/> also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the <a1_0>pecten<a1_0/>. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. <a2_0>Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads<a2_0/> have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have <a3_0>binocular vision<a3_0/> and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The <a4_0>inner ear<a4_0/> has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals."}
