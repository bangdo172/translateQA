At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends <a0_0>at hatching<a0_0/>; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great <a1_0>frigatebird<a1_0/>, whose chicks take up to six months to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. The <a2_0>chick guard stage<a2_0/> describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation."}
