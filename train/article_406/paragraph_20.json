Upon inhalation, <a1_0>75%<a1_0/> of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes <a2_0>directly into the lungs<a2_0/>. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the <a3_0>syrinx<a3_0/>, <a4_0>a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes<a4_0/> which diverges from the lower end of the trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalizations and the perception of the bird's size."}
