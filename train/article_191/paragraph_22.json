To check for a knockout in this manner, <a0_0>a referee will wave their hand in front of the wrestler's face<a0_0/>; if the wrestler does not react in any way, the referee will award the victory to the other wrestler. If all the active wrestlers in a match are down inside the ring at the same time, the referee will begin a count (<a2_0>usually ten seconds, twenty in Japan<a2_0/>). <a1_0>If nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count, the match is ruled a draw.<a1_0/> Any participant who stands up in time will end the count for everyone else. In a <a3_0>Last Man Standing<a3_0/> match, this form of a knockout is the only way that the match can end, so the referee will count when one or more wrestlers are down, and one wrestler standing up before the 10-count doesn't stop the count for another wrestler who is still down."}
