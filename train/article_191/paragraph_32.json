In recent years, however, antiheroes have also become prominent in professional wrestling. There is also a less common role of a \"<a2_0>tweener<a2_0/>\", who is neither fully face nor fully heel yet able to play either role effectively (case in point, Samoa Joe during his first run in TNA from June 2005 to November 2006)."}
