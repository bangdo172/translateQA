Although a countout can technically be considered a disqualification (as it is, for all intents and purposes, an automatic loss suffered as a result of violating a match rule), the two concepts are often distinct in wrestling. A no disqualification match can still end by countout (although this is rare); typically, a match <a2_0>must be declared a \"no holds barred\" match, a \"street fight\" or some other term<a2_0/>, in order for both disqualifications and countouts to be waived.[citation needed]"}
