This is called a \"rope break\", and it is one of the most common ways to break a submission hold. Most holds leave <a0_0>an arm or leg<a0_0/> free, so that the person can tap out if they want. Instead, they use these free limbs to either grab one of the ring ropes (the bottom one is the most common, as it is nearest the wrestlers, though other ropes sometimes are used for standing holds such as Chris Masters' Master Lock) or drape their foot across, or underneath one. Once this has been accomplished, and the accomplishment is witnessed by the referee, the referee will demand that the offending wrestler break the hold, and start counting to five if the wrestler does not. If the referee reaches <a3_0>the count of five<a3_0/>, and the wrestler still does not break the hold, <a4_0>they are disqualified<a4_0/>."}
