Sometimes a character's heel turn will become so popular that eventually the audience response will alter the character's heel-face cycle to the point where the heel persona will, in practice, become a face persona, and what was previously the face persona, will turn into the heel persona, such as when Dwayne Johnson first began using \"The Rock\" persona as a heel character, as opposed to his original \"<a2_0>Rocky Maivia<a2_0/>\" babyface persona. Another legendary example is Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was originally booked as a <a1_0>heel<a1_0/>, with such mannerisms as drinking on the job, using profanity, breaking company property, and even breaking into people's private homes. However, much to WWF's surprise, the fans enjoyed Austin's antics so much that he became <a3_0>one of the greatest antiheroes<a3_0/> in the history of the business. He, along with the stable of D-Generation X, is generally credited with ushering in the Attitude Era of WWF programming."}
