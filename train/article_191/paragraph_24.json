The count is broken and restarted when a wrestler in the ring exits the ring. Playing into this, some wrestlers will \"milk\" the count by <a2_0>sliding in the ring, and immediately sliding back out<a2_0/>. As they were technically inside the ring for a split second before exiting again, it is sufficient to restart the count. This is often referred to by commentators as \"<a3_0>breaking the count.<a3_0/>\" Heels often use this tactic in order to buy themselves more time to catch their breath, or to attempt to frustrate their babyface opponents."}
