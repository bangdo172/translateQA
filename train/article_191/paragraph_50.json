With its origins in traditional American style of wrestling and still being under the same genre, it has become an entity in itself. Despite the similarity to its American counterpart in that the <a0_0>outcome of the matches remains predetermined<a0_0/>, the phenomena are different in <a1_0>the form of the psychology and presentation of the sport<a1_0/>; it is treated as a full contact combat sport as it mixes <a2_0>hard hitting martial arts strikes with shoot style submission holds<a2_0/>, while in the U.S. it is rather more regarded as an entertainment show. Wrestlers incorporate kicks and strikes from martial arts disciplines, and a strong emphasis is placed on submission wrestling, and unlike the use of involved storylines in the U.S., they are not as intricate in Japan, more emphasis is placed on the concept of <a3_0>Fighting Spirit<a3_0/>, meaning the Wrestlers display of physical and mental stamina are valued a lot more than theatrics. Many of Japan's wrestlers including top stars such as Shinya Hashimoto, Riki Choshu and Keiji Mutoh came from a <a4_0>legitimate martial arts<a4_0/> background and many Japanese wrestlers in the 1990s began to pursue careers in mixed martial arts organizations such as Pancrase and Shooto which at the time retained the original look of puroresu, but were actual competitions."}
