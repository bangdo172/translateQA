Clubbers to The Warehouse were <a3_0><b8_0>primarily black and gay<b8_0/><a3_0/>, who came to dance to music played by the club's resident DJ <a4_0><b9_0>Frankie Knuckles<b9_0/><a4_0/>, whom fans refer to as the \"godfather of house\". After the Warehouse closed in 1983, the crowds went to Knuckles' new club, The Power Plant. In the Channel 4 documentary Pump Up The Volume, Knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term \"house music\" was upon seeing \"we play house music\" on a sign in the window of a bar on Chicago's South Side. One of the people in the car with him joked, \"you know, that's the kind of music you play down at <b5_0>the Warehouse<b5_0/>!\", and then everybody laughed. South-Side Chicago DJ Leonard \"Remix\" Roy, in self-published statements, claims he put such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one's home; in his case, it referred to his mother's soul & disco records, which he worked into his sets. Farley Jackmaster Funk was quoted as saying \"In 1982, I was DJing at a club called The Playground and there was this kid named Leonard 'Remix' Roy who was a DJ at a rival club called The Rink. He came over to my club one night, and into the DJ booth and said to me, 'I've got the gimmick that's gonna take all the people out of your club and into mine \u2013 it's called House music.' Now, where he got that name from or what made him think of it I don't know, so the answer lies with him.\""}
