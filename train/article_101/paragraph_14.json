However, Chip E. himself lends credence to the Knuckles association, claiming the name came from methods of labeling records at the <a2_0><b5_0><b6_0>Importes Etc<b5_0/><a2_0/>.<b6_0/> record store, where he worked in the early 1980s: bins of music that DJ Knuckles played at the Warehouse nightclub were labelled in the store \"As Heard At The Warehouse\", which was shortened to simply \"House\". Patrons later asked for new music for the bins, which Chip E. implies was a demand the shop tried to meet by stocking newer local club hits."}
