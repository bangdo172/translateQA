The record shot up to Number Five on the Billboard Club Chart, marking it as the first House record by a white artist to chart in the U.S. Dada Nada, the moniker for <a4_0>Ozn<a4_0/>'s solo act, released in 1990, what has become a classic example of jazz-based Deep House, the Frankie Knuckles and David Morales remix of Dada Nada's \"Deep Love\" (<b7_0>One Voice Records<b7_0/>/US, Polydor/UK), featuring <b9_0>Ozn<b9_0/>'s lush, crooning vocals and muted trumpet improvisational solos, underscoring Deep House's progression into a genre that integrated jazz and pop songwriting structures \u2013 a feature which continued to set it apart from Acid House and Techno."}
