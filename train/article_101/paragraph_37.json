These superclubs entered into sponsorship deals initially with fast food, soft drinks, and clothing companies. Flyers in clubs in Ibiza often sported many corporate logos. A new subgenre, <a1_0><b6_0>Chicago hard house<b6_0/><a1_0/>, was developed by DJs such as Bad Boy Bill, DJ Lynnwood, DJ Irene, Richard \"Humpty\" Vission and DJ Enrie, mixing elements of Chicago house, funky house and hard house together. Additionally, Producers such as George Centeno, Darren Ramirez, and Martin O. Cairo would develop the <a2_0><b7_0>Los Angeles<b7_0/><a2_0/> Hard House sound. Similar to <a3_0><b8_0>gabber<b8_0/><a3_0/> or hardcore techno from the Netherlands, this sound was often associated with the \"rebel\" culture of the time. These 3 producers are often considered \"ahead of their time\" since many of the sounds they engineered during the late 20th century became more prominent during the 21st century."}
