House and rave clubs such as Lakota and Cream emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in <a0_0>Britain<a0_0/> with ambient house albums such as The KLF's Chill Out and Analogue Bubblebath by <a1_0><b6_0>Aphex Twin<b6_0/><a1_0/>. The Godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in Cambridge and Northampton, the associated events scaled up in Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Leeds. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In <a2_0><b7_0>New York<b7_0/><a2_0/>, bands such as Deee-Lite furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were the <a3_0><b8_0>Orb<b8_0/><a3_0/>'s \"Little Fluffy Clouds\" (with a distinctive vocal sample from Rickie Lee Jones) and the Happy Mondays' \"Wrote for Luck\" (\"WFL\") which was transformed into a dance hit by <a4_0><b9_0>Vince Clarke<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
