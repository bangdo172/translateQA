Descartes's work, along with <b7_0>Avicenna<b7_0/>'s, prefigured the 19th-century development of specificity theory. <a2_0>Specificity<a2_0/> theory saw pain as \"a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses\". Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an <a3_0>emotional<a3_0/> state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid-1890s, <b8_0>specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians<b8_0/>, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of <b9_0>clinical observations<b9_0/> by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey, the <a4_0>psychologists<a4_0/> migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact."}
