Pain that lasts a long time is called <b6_0>chronic or persistent,<b6_0/> and pain that resolves quickly is called <a2_0>acute<a2_0/>. Traditionally, the distinction between acute and chronic pain has relied upon an arbitrary <a3_0>interval of time from onset<a3_0/>; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain, though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at <b7_0>12 months<b7_0/>.:93 Others apply acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days, chronic to pain of more than six months' duration, and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months. A popular alternative definition of chronic pain, involving no arbitrarily fixed durations, is \"<b8_0>pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing<b8_0/>\". Chronic pain may be classified as <a4_0>cancer pain<a4_0/> or else as benign."}
