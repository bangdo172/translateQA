He describes the alternative as a simple, mental raising of a \"red flag\". To argue why that red flag might be insufficient, Dawkins explains that <a1_0>drives<a1_0/> must compete with each other within living beings. The most fit creature would be the <a2_0>one whose pains are well balanced<a2_0/>. Those pains which mean certain death when ignored will become the most powerfully felt. The relative intensities of pain, then, may resemble the relative importance of that <a3_0>risk<a3_0/> to our ancestors (lack of food, too much cold, or serious injuries are felt as agony, whereas minor damage is felt as mere discomfort). This resemblance will not be perfect, however, because natural selection can be a <a4_0>poor<a4_0/> designer. The result is often <b7_0>glitches in animals<b7_0/>, including supernormal stimuli. Such glitches help explain pains which are not, or at least no longer directly adaptive (e.g. perhaps some forms of toothache, or injury to fingernails)."}
