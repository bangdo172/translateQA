However, like infants (Latin infans meaning \"<b5_0>unable to speak<b5_0/>\"), animals cannot answer questions about <a1_0>whether they feel pain<a1_0/>; thus the defining criterion for pain in humans cannot be applied to them. Philosophers and scientists have responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways. Ren\u00e9 Descartes for example argued <b6_0>that animals lack <a2_0>consciousness<a2_0/> and therefore do not experience pain and suffering in the way that humans do<b6_0/>. Bernard Rollin of <a3_0>Colorado State University<a3_0/>, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, writes that <b7_0>researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain,<b7_0/> and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain. In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to \"prove\" that animals are conscious, and to provide \"scientifically acceptable\" grounds for claiming that they feel pain. Carbone writes <b8_0>that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view<b8_0/>. Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support, some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined. The ability of invertebrate species of animals, such as insects, to feel pain and suffering is also <a4_0><b9_0>unclear<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
