They proposed that all skin fiber endings (with the exception of those innervating hair cells) are <a2_0>identical<a2_0/>, and that pain is produced by intense stimulation of these fibers. Another 20th-century theory was <b9_0>gate control theory<b9_0/>, introduced by Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall in the 1965 Science article <b8_0>\"Pain Mechanisms: A New Theory\"<b8_0/>. The authors proposed that both thin (pain) and large diameter (touch, pressure, vibration) <a3_0>nerve fibers<a3_0/> carry information from the site of injury to two destinations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and that the more large fiber activity relative to thin fiber activity at the inhibitory cell, the less pain is felt. Both peripheral pattern theory and gate control theory have been <a4_0>superseded by more modern theories of pain<a4_0/>[citation needed]."}
