Examples include <b7_0>sprains and broken bones<b7_0/>. <a4_0>Superficial<a4_0/> pain is initiated by <b8_0>activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue,<b8_0/> and is sharp, well-defined and clearly located. Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor (first degree) burns."}
