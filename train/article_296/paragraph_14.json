The first consumer player, the <a1_0>Magnavox VH-8000<a1_0/> even had the VLP logo on the player. For a while in the early and mid-1970s, Philips also discussed a compatible audio-only format they called \"ALP\", but that was soon dropped as the Compact Disc system became a non-compatible project in the Philips corporation. Until early 1980, the format had no \"official\" name. <a2_0>The LaserVision Association<a2_0/>, made up of <a3_0>MCA, Universal-Pioneer, IBM, and Philips/Magnavox<a3_0/>, was formed to standardize the technical specifications of the format (which had been causing problems for the consumer market) and finally named the system officially as \"LaserVision\"."}
