While good comb filters can do so adequately, these two signals cannot be completely separated. On DVDs, data is stored in the form of <a0_0>digital blocks which make up each independent frame<a0_0/>. The signal produced is dependent on the equipment used to master the disc. Signals range from composite and split, to YUV and RGB. Depending upon which format is used, this can result in far higher fidelity, particularly at strong color borders or regions of high detail (especially if there is moderate movement in the picture) and <a3_0>low-contrast details like skin tones<a3_0/>, where <a2_0>comb filters almost inevitably smudge some detail<a2_0/>."}
