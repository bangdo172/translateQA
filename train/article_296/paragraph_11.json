PAL discs only have <a1_0>two<a1_0/> audio tracks, consisting of either <a2_0>two analog-only tracks on older PAL LDs, or two digital-only tracks on newer discs<a2_0/>. In comparison, later NTSC LDs are capable of carrying four tracks (two analog and two digital). On certain releases, one of the analog tracks is used to carry a modulated AC-3 signal for 5.1 channel audio (for decoding and playback by newer LD players with an \"AC-3 RF\" output). However, older NTSC LDs made before 1984 (such as the original DiscoVision discs) only have two analog audio tracks."}
