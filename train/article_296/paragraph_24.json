Early DVD demo discs often had compression or encoding problems, lending additional support to such claims at the time. However, the <a2_0>video signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth<a2_0/> of LaserDisc are substantially less than that of DVDs, making <a1_0>DVDs<a1_0/> appear sharper and clearer to most viewers."}
