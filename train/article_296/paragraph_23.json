Some newer DVD players feature a repair+skip algorithm, which alleviates this problem by continuing to play the disc, <a0_0>filling in unreadable areas of the picture with blank space or a frozen frame of the last readable image and sound<a0_0/>. The success of this feature depends upon the amount of damage. LaserDisc players, when working in full analog, recover from such errors faster than <a2_0>DVD<a2_0/> players. Direct comparison here is almost impossible due to the sheer size differences between the two media. A 1 in (3 cm) scratch on a DVD will probably cause more problems than a 1 in (3 cm) scratch on a LaserDisc, but a fingerprint taking up 1% of the area of a <a1_0>DVD<a1_0/> would almost certainly cause fewer problems than a similar mark covering 1% of the surface of a LaserDisc.[citation needed]"}
