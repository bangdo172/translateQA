Squeeze LDs were <a0_0>enhanced <a1_0>16:9-ratio widescreen<a1_0/> LaserDiscs<a0_0/>. During the video transfer stage, the movie was stored in an anamorphic \"squeezed\" format. The widescreen movie image was stretched to fill the entire video frame with less or none of the video resolution wasted to create letterbox bars. The advantage was a <a4_0>33%<a4_0/> greater vertical resolution compared to letterboxed widescreen LaserDisc. This same procedure was used for anamorphic DVDs, but unlike all DVD players, very few LD players had the ability to unsqueeze the image for 4:3 sets, and very few if any 4:3 sets could be set to play them properly either. If the discs were played on a standard 4:3 television the image would be <a3_0>distorted<a3_0/>. Since <a2_0>very few people owned 16:9 displays<a2_0/>, the marketability of these special discs was very limited."}
