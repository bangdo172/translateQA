It was claimed that <a2_0>Macrovision's Copyguard protection<a2_0/> could not be applied to LaserDisc, due to the format's design. The vertical blanking interval, where the Macrovision signal would be implemented, was also used for the <a0_0>internal timing<a0_0/> on LaserDisc players, so test discs with Macrovision would not play at all. There was never a push to redesign the format despite the obvious potential for piracy due to its <a1_0>relatively small market share<a1_0/>. The industry simply decided to engineer it into the DVD specification."}
