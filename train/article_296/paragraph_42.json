Encoded using NHK's MUSE \"Hi-Vision\" analogue TV system, MUSE discs would operate like standard LaserDiscs but would contain high-definition 1,125-line (1,035 visible lines) (Sony HDVS) video with a <a0_0>5:3<a0_0/> aspect ratio. The MUSE players were also capable of playing standard NTSC format discs and are superior in performance to non-MUSE players even with these NTSC discs. The MUSE-capable players had several noteworthy advantages over standard LaserDisc players, including a red laser with a much narrower wavelength than the lasers found in standard players. The red laser was <a1_0>capable of reading through disc defects such as scratches and even mild disc rot that would cause most other players to stop, stutter or drop-out<a1_0/>. <a2_0>Crosstalk<a2_0/> was not an issue with MUSE discs, and the narrow wavelength of the laser allowed for the virtual elimination of crosstalk with normal discs."}
