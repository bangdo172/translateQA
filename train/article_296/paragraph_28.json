Because of this, slight dust and scratches on the disc surface can result in read-errors which cause various video quality problems: <a0_0>glitches, streaks, bursts of static, or momentary picture interruptions<a0_0/>. In contrast, the <a1_0>digital MPEG-2<a1_0/> format information used on DVDs has built-in error correction which ensures that the signal from a damaged disc will remain identical to that from a perfect disc right up until the point at which damage to the disc surface is so substantial that it prevents the laser from being able to identify usable data."}
