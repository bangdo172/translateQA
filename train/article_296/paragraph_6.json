PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks, either analog or digital and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit 44.1 kHz as on a CD; in the UK, the term <a0_0>\"LaserVision\" is used to refer to discs with analog sound, while \"LaserDisc\" is used for those with digital audio<a0_0/>. The digital sound signal in both formats are EFM-encoded as in CD. Dolby Digital (also called AC-3) and DTS\u2014which are now common on DVD titles\u2014first became available on LaserDisc, and Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999) which was released on LaserDisc in Japan, is among the first home video releases ever to include <a1_0>6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround.<a1_0/> Unlike DVDs, which carry <a2_0>Dolby Digital audio in digital form<a2_0/>, LaserDiscs store Dolby Digital in a frequency modulated form within a track normally used for analog audio. Extracting Dolby Digital from a LaserDisc required a player equipped with a special \"AC-3 RF\" output and an external demodulator in addition to an AC-3 decoder. The demodulator was necessary to convert the 2.88 MHz modulated AC-3 information on the disc into a 384 kbit/s signal that the decoder could handle. DTS audio, when available on a disc, replaced the digital audio tracks; hearing DTS sound required only an S/PDIF compliant digital connection to a DTS decoder."}
