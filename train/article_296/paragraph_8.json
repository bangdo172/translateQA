Many early and lower-end LD players had poor analog audio components, and many early discs had poorly mastered analog audio tracks, making <a1_0>digital<a1_0/> soundtracks in any form most desirable to serious enthusiasts. Early DiscoVision and LaserDisc titles lacked the digital audio option, but many of those movies received digital sound in later re-issues by <a3_0>Universal<a3_0/>, and the quality of analog audio tracks generally got far better as time went on. Many discs that had originally carried old analog stereo tracks received new Dolby Stereo and Dolby Surround tracks instead, often in addition to digital tracks, helping boost sound quality.
