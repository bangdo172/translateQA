Due to integration with the Japanese export market, <a2_0>NTSC<a2_0/> LaserDiscs were used in the Hong Kong market, in contrast to the <a1_0>PAL standard<a1_0/> used for broadcast (This anomaly also exists for DVD). This created a market for multi-system TVs and multi-system VCRs which could display or play both PAL and NTSC materials in addition to SECAM materials (which were never popular in Hong Kong). Some LD players could convert NTSC signals to PAL so that most TVs used in Hong Kong could display the LD materials."}
