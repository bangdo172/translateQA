After one side was finished playing, <a0_0>a disc has to be flipped over in order to continue watching<a0_0/> a movie, and some titles fill two or more discs. Many players, especially units built after the mid-1980s, can \"flip\" discs automatically by rotating the optical pickup to the other side of the disc, but this is accompanied by a pause in the movie during the side change. If the movie is longer than what could be stored on two sides of a single disc, manually swapping to a second disc is necessary at some point during the film. One exception to this rule is the <a1_0>Pioneer LD-W1<a1_0/>, which features two disc platters. In addition, perfect still frames and random access to individual still frames is limited only to the more expensive CAV discs, which only had a playing time of approximately 30 minutes per side. In later years, Pioneer and other manufacturers overcame this limitation by incorporating a digital memory buffer, which \"grabbed\" a single frame from a CLV disc."}
