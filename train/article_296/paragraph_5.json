CAA55 was introduced in 1985 with a total playback capacity per side of <a0_0>55 minutes 5 seconds<a0_0/>, reducing the video capacity to resolve bandwidth issues with the inclusion of Digital Audio. Several titles released between 1985 and 1987 were analog audio only <a1_0>due to the length of the title and the desire to keep the film on one disc<a1_0/> (e.g., Back to the Future). By 1987, Pioneer had overcome the technical challenges and was able to once again encode in CAA60, allowing a total of <a2_0>60 minutes 5 seconds<a2_0/>. Pioneer further refined CAA, offering CAA45, encoding 45 minutes of material, but filling the entire playback surface of the side. Used on only a handful of titles, CAA65 offered 65 minutes 5 seconds of playback time per side. There are a handful of titles pressed by Technidisc that used CAA50. The final variant of CAA is CAA70, which could accommodate 70 minutes of playback time per side. <a3_0>There are not any known uses of this format on the consumer market<a3_0/>."}
