This was a problem that was termed \"laser rot\" among LD enthusiasts, also called <a1_0>\"color flash\"<a1_0/> internally by LaserDisc-pressing plants. Some forms of laser rot could appear as <a2_0>black spots that looked like mold or burned plastic which cause the disc to skip and the movie to exhibit excessive speckling noise<a2_0/>. But, for the most part, rotted discs could actually appear perfectly fine to the naked eye."}
