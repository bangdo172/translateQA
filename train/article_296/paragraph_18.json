A VHS cassette has <a1_0>at least 14<a1_0/> parts including the actual tape while LaserDisc has one part with five or six layers. A disc can be stamped out in a matter of seconds whereas duplicating videotape required a complex bulk tape duplication mechanism and was a time-consuming process. However, by the end of the 1980s, average disc-pressing prices were over <a2_0>$5.00 per two-sided disc<a2_0/>, due to the large amount of plastic material and the costly glass-mastering process needed to make the metal stamper mechanisms. Due to the larger volume of demand, videocassettes quickly became much cheaper to duplicate, costing <a3_0>as little as $1.00<a3_0/> by the beginning of the 1990s."}
