The issue can arise <a0_0>when the laser optical pickup assembly within the player is out of alignment or because the disc is damaged or excessively warped<a0_0/>, but it could also occur even with a properly functioning player and a factory-new disc, depending on electrical and mechanical alignment problems. In these instances, the issue arose due to the fact that CLV discs require subtle changes in rotating speed at various points during playback. During a change in speed, the optical pickup inside the player might read video information from a track adjacent to the intended one, causing data from the two tracks to \"cross\"; the extra video information picked up from that second track shows up as distortion in the picture which looks reminiscent of <a2_0>swirling \"barber poles\" or rolling lines of static<a2_0/>."}
