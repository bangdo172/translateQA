Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (in fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who elaborated them into new forms, which resulted in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity. Despite newer added amalgamations, the Ottoman dynasty, like their predecessors in the <a0_0>Sultanate of Rum<a0_0/> and the Seljuk Empire, were thoroughly <a3_0>Persianised<a3_0/> in their culture, language, habits and customs, and therefore, the empire has been described as a <a1_0>Persianate empire<a1_0/>. Intercultural marriages also played their part in creating the characteristic Ottoman elite culture. When compared to the Turkish folk culture, the influence of these new cultures in creating the culture of the Ottoman elite was clear."}
