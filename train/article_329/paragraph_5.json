Osman's son, <a2_0>Orhan<a2_0/>, captured the northwestern Anatolian city of <a0_0>Bursa<a0_0/> in <a1_0>1324<a1_0/>, and made it the new capital of the Ottoman state. This Ottoman conquest meant the loss of Byzantine control over northwestern Anatolia. The important city of <a3_0>Thessaloniki<a3_0/> was captured from the Venetians in 1387. The Ottoman victory at Kosovo in <a4_0>1389<a4_0/> effectively marked the end of Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe. The Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale crusade of the Middle Ages, failed to stop the advance of the victorious Ottoman Turks."}
