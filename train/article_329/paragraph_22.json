In 1861, there were <a0_0>571<a0_0/> primary and 94 secondary schools for Ottoman Christians with <a1_0>140,000<a1_0/> pupils in total, a figure that vastly exceeded the number of Muslim children in school at the same time, who were further hindered by the amount of time spent learning Arabic and Islamic theology. In turn, the higher educational levels of the Christians allowed them to play a large role in the economy. In 1911, of the <a4_0>654<a4_0/> wholesale companies in Istanbul, <a2_0>528<a2_0/> were owned by ethnic Greeks. Of course, it would be a mistake to ignore the geopolitical dimensions of this dynamic. The preponderance of Christian merchants owed not to any innate business sense on their part, although plenty of European observers were keen on making this point. In fact, in many cases, Christians and also Jews were able to gain protection from European <a3_0>consuls and citizenship<a3_0/>, meaning they were protected from Ottoman law and not subject to the same economic regulations as their Muslim comrades."}
