The empire had managed to control nearly all former <a1_0>Byzantine<a1_0/> lands surrounding the city, but in 1402 the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when the Turco-Mongol leader <a2_0>Timur<a2_0/>, founder of the <a3_0>Timurid Empire<a3_0/>, invaded Anatolia from the east. In the <a4_0>Battle of Ankara<a4_0/> in 1402, Timur defeated the Ottoman forces and took Sultan Bayezid I as a prisoner, throwing the empire into disorder. The ensuing civil war lasted from 1402 to 1413 as Bayezid's sons fought over succession. It ended when Mehmed I emerged as the sultan and restored Ottoman power, bringing an end to the Interregnum, also known as the Fetret Devri."}
