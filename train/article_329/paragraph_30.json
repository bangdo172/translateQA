The Ottomans practiced a system in which <a2_0>the state<a2_0/> (as in the Byzantine Empire) had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic Iran remained important in Ottoman administrative circles. According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was <a3_0>to defend and extend the land of the Muslims<a3_0/> and to ensure security and harmony within its borders within the overarching context of <a4_0>orthodox Islamic practice<a4_0/> and dynastic sovereignty."}
