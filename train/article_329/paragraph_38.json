The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the Ottoman Army included <a2_0>Janissary, Sipahi, Ak\u0131nc\u0131 and Mehter\u00e2n<a2_0/>. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use <a3_0>muskets and cannons<a3_0/>. The Ottoman Turks began using falconets, which were short but wide cannons, during the <a4_0>Siege of Constantinople<a4_0/>. The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armour, using bows and short swords on fast Turkoman and Arabian horses (progenitors of the Thoroughbred racing horse), and often applied tactics similar to those of the Mongol Empire, such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack. The decline in the army's performance became clear from the mid-17th century and after the Great Turkish War. The 18th century saw some limited success against Venice, but in the north the European-style Russian armies forced the Ottomans to concede land."}
