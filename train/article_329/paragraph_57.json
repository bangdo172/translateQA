A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to <a1_0>the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or rhymed prose<a1_0/>, a type of writing descended from the Arabic saj' and which prescribed that <a2_0>between each adjective and noun in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a rhyme<a2_0/>. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature. One apparent exception was Muhayyel\u00e2t (\"Fancies\") by <a3_0>Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi<a3_0/>, a collection of stories of the fantastic written in <a4_0>1796<a4_0/>, though not published until 1867. The first novel published in the Ottoman Empire was by an Armenian named Vartan Pasha. Published in 1851, the novel was entitled The Story of Akabi (Turkish: Akabi Hikyayesi) and was written in Turkish but with Armenian script."}
