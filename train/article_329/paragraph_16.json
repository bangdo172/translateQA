The resulting Treaty of Zuhab of that same year decisively parted the Caucasus and adjacent regions between the two neighbouring empires as it had already been defined in the 1555 Peace of Amasya. The Sultanate of women (1648\u20131656) was a period in which the mothers of young sultans exercised power on behalf of their sons. The most prominent women of this period were K\u00f6sem Sultan and her daughter-in-law Turhan Hatice, whose political rivalry culminated in K\u00f6sem's murder in <a2_0>1651<a2_0/>. During the K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Era (<a3_0>1656\u20131703<a3_0/>), effective control of the Empire was exercised by a sequence of Grand Viziers from the K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family. The K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Vizierate saw renewed military success with authority restored in Transylvania, the conquest of <a4_0>Crete<a4_0/> completed in 1669, and expansion into Polish southern Ukraine, with the strongholds of Khotyn and Kamianets-Podilskyi and the territory of Podolia ceding to Ottoman control in 1676."}
