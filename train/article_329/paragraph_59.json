In a similar vein, the novelist <a2_0>Ahmed Midhat Efendi<a2_0/> wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mell\u00e2h y\u00e2hud S\u0131rr \u0130\u00e7inde Esr\u00e2r, 1873; \"Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery\"), Realism (<a3_0>Hen\u00fcz On Yedi Ya\u015f\u0131nda<a3_0/>, 1881; \"Just Seventeen Years Old\"), and Naturalism (M\u00fc\u015f\u00e2hed\u00e2t, 1891; \"Observations\"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would <a4_0>contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman social structures<a4_0/>."}
