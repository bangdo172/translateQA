Due to Eritrea's relative isolation, information and resources are extremely limited and according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) found in 2008 average life expectancy to be slightly less than 63 years. Immunisation and child nutrition has been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to <b6_0>78.5%<b6_0/> and the underweight prevalence among children decreased by 12% in 1995\u2013<b8_0>2002<b8_0/> (severe underweight prevalence by 28%).
