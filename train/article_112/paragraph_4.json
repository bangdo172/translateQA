The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content. Ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L, depending on the grape variety, because it is fermented with the skins, allowing the wine to absorb the <a2_0>resveratrol<a2_0/>. By contrast, a <a1_0>white wine<a1_0/> contains lower phenolic contents because it is fermented after removal of skins."}
