While almost all of them belong to the same species, <a2_0>Vitis vinifera<a2_0/>, table and wine grapes have significant differences, brought about through selective breeding. <a3_0>Table grape<a3_0/> cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is <a4_0>approximately 24%<a4_0/> sugar by weight. By comparison, commercially produced \"100% grape juice\", made from table grapes, is usually around 15% sugar by weight."}
