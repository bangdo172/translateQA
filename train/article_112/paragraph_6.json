Instructions concerning wine are given in the book of Proverbs and in the book of Isaiah, such as in Proverbs 20:1 and Isaiah 5:20\u201325. <a3_0>Deuteronomy<a3_0/> 18:3\u20135,14:22\u201327,16:13\u201315 tell of the use of wine during Jewish feasts. Grapes were also significant to both the Greeks and Romans, and their god of agriculture, <a1_0>Dionysus<a1_0/>, was linked to grapes and wine, being frequently portrayed with grape leaves on his head. Grapes are especially significant for Christians, who since the Early Church have used wine in their celebration of the Eucharist. Views on the significance of the wine vary between denominations. In Christian art, grapes often represent the blood of <a2_0>Christ<a2_0/>, such as the grape leaves in Caravaggio\u2019s John the Baptist."}
