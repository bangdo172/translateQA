The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia. The oldest winery was found in <a2_0>Armenia<a2_0/>, dating to around 4000 BC.[citation needed] By the 9th century AD the city of Shiraz was known to produce some of the finest wines in the Middle East. Thus it has been proposed that Syrah red wine is named after <a3_0>Shiraz<a3_0/>, a city in Persia where the grape was used to make Shirazi wine.[citation needed] Ancient Egyptian <a4_0>hieroglyphics<a4_0/> record the cultivation of purple grapes,[citation needed] and history attests to the ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, and Romans growing purple grapes for both eating and wine production[citation needed]. The growing of grapes would later spread to other regions in Europe, as well as North Africa, and eventually in North America."}
