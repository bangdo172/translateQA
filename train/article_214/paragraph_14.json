This conclusion is disputed by critics. <a2_0>John Pilger<a2_0/> has said that a late-1970s edition of the Daily Mirror, which replaced the usual celebrity and domestic political news items with an entire issue devoted to his own front-line reporting of <a3_0>the genocide in Pol Pot's Cambodia<a3_0/>, not only outsold The Sun on the day it was issued but became <a4_0>the only edition of the Daily Mirror to ever sell every single copy issued throughout the country<a4_0/>, something never achieved by The Sun."}
