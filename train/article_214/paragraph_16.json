They began with an invented account of the singer having sexual relationships with <a1_0>rent boys<a1_0/>. The singer-songwriter was abroad on the day indicated in the story, as former Sun journalist <a2_0>John Blake<a2_0/>, recently poached by the Daily Mirror, soon discovered. After further stories, in September 1987, The Sun accused John of having his <a3_0>Rottweiler<a3_0/> guard dogs voice boxes surgically removed. In November, the Daily Mirror found their rival's only source for the rent boy story and he admitted it was a totally fictitious concoction created for money. The inaccurate story about his dogs, actually Alsatians, put pressure on The Sun, and John received \u00a31 million in an out of court settlement, then the largest damages payment in British history. The Sun ran a front-page apology on 12 December 1988, under the banner headline \"SORRY, ELTON\". In May 1987 gay men were offered free one-way airline tickets to <a4_0>Norway<a4_0/> to leave Britain for good: \"Fly Away Gays - And We Will Pay\" was the paper's headline. Gay Church of England clergymen were described in one headline in November 1987 as \"Pulpit poofs\"."}
