All six were charged with <a0_0>conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office<a0_0/>. They included The Sun's head of news Chris Pharo, who faced six charges, while ex-managing editor Graham Dudman and ex-Sun deputy news editor Ben O'Driscoll were accused of four charges each. Thames Valley district reporter Jamie Pyatt and picture editor John Edwards were charged with three counts each, while ex-reporter John Troup was accused of two counts. The trial related to <a1_0>illegal payments allegedly made to public officials<a1_0/>, with prosecutors saying the men conspired to pay officials from 2002\u201311, including police, prison officers and soldiers. They were accused of buying confidential information about <a2_0>the Royal Family, public figures and prison inmates<a2_0/>. They all denied the charges. On 16 January 2015, Troup and Edwards were cleared by the jury of all charges against them. The jury also partially cleared O'Driscoll and Dudman but continued deliberating over other counts faced by them, as well as the charges against Pharo and Pyatt. On 21 January 2015, the jury told the court that it was unable to reach unanimous verdicts on any of the outstanding charges and was told by the judge, <a3_0>Richard Marks<a3_0/>, that he would accept majority verdicts. Shortly afterwards, one of the jurors sent a note to the judge and was discharged. The judge told the remaining 11 jurors that their colleague had been \"feeling unwell and feeling under a great deal of pressure and stress from the situation you are in\", and that under the circumstances he was prepared to accept majority verdicts of \"11 to zero or 10 to 1\". On 22 January 2015, the jury was discharged after <a4_0>failing to reach verdicts on the outstanding charges<a4_0/>. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that it would seek a retrial."}
