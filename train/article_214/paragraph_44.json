As a result of the change in the CPS\u2019 policy, charges against several journalists who had made payments to other types of public officials \u2013 including civil servants, health workers and prison staff - had been dropped. In July 2015, Private Eye magazine reported that at a costs hearing at the Old Bailey The Sun's parent company had refused to pay for the prosecution costs relating to France\u2019s trial, leading the presiding judge to express his \"considerable disappointment\" at this state of affairs. Judge <a2_0>Timothy Pontius<a2_0/> said in court that France\u2019s illegal actions had been part of a \"clearly recognised procedure at The Sun\", adding that, \"There can be no doubt that <a3_0>News International<a3_0/> bears some measure of moral responsibility if not legal culpability for the acts of the defendant\". The Private Eye report noted that despite this The Sun's parent organisation was \"considering disciplinary actions\" against France whilst at the same time it was also preparing to bring a case to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal against <a4_0>the London Metropolitan Police Service<a4_0/> for its actions relating to him and two other journalists."}
