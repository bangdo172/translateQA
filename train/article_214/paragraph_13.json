On 23 May 1984, The Sun prepared a front page with the headline \"Mine F\u00fchrer\" and a photograph of Scargill with his arm in the air, a pose which made him look as though he was <a2_0>giving a Nazi salute<a2_0/>. The print workers at The Sun refused to print it. The Sun <a3_0>strongly supported the April 1986 bombing<a3_0/> of Libya by the US, which was launched from British bases. Several civilians were killed during the bombing. Their leader was \"Right Ron, Right Maggie\". That year, Labour MP <a4_0>Clare Short<a4_0/> attempted in vain to persuade Parliament to outlaw the pictures on Page Three and gained opprobrium from the newspaper for her stand."}
