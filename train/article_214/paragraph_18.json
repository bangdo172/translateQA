Lord Kilbracken said that only one person out of the 2,372 individuals with HIV/AIDS mentioned in a specific Department of Health report was not a member of a \"high risk group\", such as <a2_0>homosexuals and recreational drug users<a2_0/>. The Sun also ran an editorial further arguing that \"At last the truth can be told... the risk of catching AIDS if you are heterosexual is \"statistically invisible\". In other words, impossible. So now we know \u2013 everything else is homosexual propaganda.\" Although many other British press services covered Lord Kilbracken's public comments, none of them made the argument that the Sun did in its editorial and <a4_0>none of them presented Lord Kilbracken's ideas without context or criticism<a4_0/>."}
