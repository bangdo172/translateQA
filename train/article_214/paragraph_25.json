John Major's Conservatives, it said, were <a3_0>\"tired, divided and rudderless\"<a3_0/>. <a4_0>Blair<a4_0/>, who had radically altered his party's image and policies, noting the influence the paper could have over its readers' political thinking, had courted it (and Murdoch) for some time by granting exclusive interviews and writing columns."}
