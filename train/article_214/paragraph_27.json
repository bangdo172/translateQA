The attacks came from the <a1_0>Prime Minister's press spokesman Alastair Campbell and the Home Secretary David Blunkett<a1_0/> (later a Sun columnist). The paper rebutted the claim, believing that it was not racist to suggest that a \"tide\" of unchecked illegal immigrants was increasing the risk of terrorist attacks and infectious diseases. It did not help its argument by publishing a front page story on 4 July 2003, under the headline \"Swan Bake\", which claimed that <a2_0>asylum seekers were slaughtering and eating swans<a2_0/>. It later proved to have no basis in fact. Subsequently The Sun published a follow-up headlined \"Now they're after our fish!\". Following a Press Complaints Commission adjudication a \"clarification\" was eventually printed, on page 41. In 2005 The Sun published photographs of <a4_0>Prince Harry<a4_0/> sporting a Nazi costume to a fancy dress party. The photographs caused outrage across the world and Clarence House was forced to issue a statement in response apologising for any offence or embarrassment caused."}
