More recently, emotion is said to consist of all the components. The different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline. In psychology and philosophy, emotion typically includes a subjective, conscious experience characterized primarily by <b8_0>psychophysiological<b8_0/> expressions, biological reactions, and mental states. A similar multicomponential description of emotion is found in sociology.
