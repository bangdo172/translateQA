Emotions are brief in duration and consist of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, physiological, behavioural, and neural mechanisms. <a1_0><b6_0>Psychotherapist<b6_0/><a1_0/> <a0_0><b5_0>Michael C. Graham<b5_0/><a0_0/> describes all emotions as existing on a continuum of intensity. Thus fear might range from mild concern to <a2_0><b7_0>terror<b7_0/><a2_0/> or shame might range from simple <a3_0><b8_0>embarrassment<b8_0/><a3_0/> to toxic shame. Emotions have also been described as biologically given and a result of evolution because they provided good solutions to ancient and recurring problems that faced our ancestors. <a4_0><b9_0>Moods<b9_0/><a4_0/> are feelings that tend to be less intense than emotions and that often lack a contextual stimulus."}
