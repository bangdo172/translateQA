The set of components is not fixed, either by human evolutionary history or by social norms and roles. Instead, the emotional episode is assembled <a1_0><b4_0>at the moment of its occurrence<b4_0/><a1_0/> to suit its specific circumstances. One implication is that all cases of, for example, <a2_0><b5_0>fear<b5_0/><a2_0/> are not identical but instead bear a family resemblance to one another."}
