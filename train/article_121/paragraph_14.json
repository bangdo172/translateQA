Pioneering work by Broca (<a0_0><b3_0>1878<b3_0/><a0_0/>), <a1_0><b4_0>Papez<b4_0/><a1_0/> (1937), and MacLean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the <a2_0><b5_0>hypothalamus<b5_0/><a2_0/>, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance."}
