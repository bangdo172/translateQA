In <a0_0>computer science<a0_0/>, affective computing is a branch of the study and development of artificial intelligence that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences, psychology, and cognitive science. While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion, the more modern branch of computer science originated with <a1_0><b5_0>Rosalind Picard's 1995 paper<b5_0/><a1_0/> on affective computing. Detecting emotional information begins with <a2_0><b6_0>passive sensors<b6_0/><a2_0/> which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. Emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by <a3_0><b7_0>analyzing speech patterns<b7_0/><a3_0/>. The detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors."}
