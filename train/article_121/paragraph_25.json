In <a0_0><b5_0>stoic<b5_0/><a0_0/> theories it was seen as a hindrance to reason and therefore a hindrance to virtue. <a1_0><b6_0>Aristotle<b6_0/><a1_0/> believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue. In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called <a2_0><b7_0>passions<b7_0/><a2_0/>) corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and <a3_0><b8_0>Thomas Aquinas<b8_0/><a3_0/> in particular. There are also theories of emotions in the works of philosophers such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, <a4_0>Baruch Spinoza<a4_0/> and David Hume. In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an empiricist psychiatric perspective."}
