From the component processing perspective, emotion experience is said to require that all of these processes become coordinated and synchronized for a short period of time, driven by <a2_0><b5_0>appraisal<b5_0/><a2_0/> processes. Although the inclusion of cognitive appraisal as one of the elements is slightly controversial, since some theorists make the assumption that emotion and cognition are separate but interacting systems, the component processing model provides a sequence of events that effectively describes the coordination involved during an emotional episode."}
