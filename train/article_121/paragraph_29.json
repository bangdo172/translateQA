For Cooley (1992), <a1_0><b6_0>pride and shame<b6_0/><a1_0/> were the most important emotions that drive people to take various social actions. During every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the \"looking glass\" that the gestures and reactions of others provide. Depending on these reactions, we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular paths of action. <a2_0><b7_0>Retzinger<b7_0/><a2_0/> (1991) conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame. Drawing predominantly on <a4_0><b9_0>Goffman<b9_0/><a4_0/> and Cooley's work, <a3_0><b8_0>Scheff<b8_0/><a3_0/> (1990) developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond. The formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions."}
