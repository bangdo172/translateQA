The emotion of <a0_0><b5_0>anger<b5_0/><a0_0/> is in many cultures discouraged in girls and women, while <a1_0><b6_0>fear<b6_0/><a1_0/> is discouraged in boys and men. Expectations attached to social roles, such as \"acting as man\" and not as a woman, and the accompanying \"feeling rules\" contribute to the differences in expression of certain emotions. Some cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, or jealousy, and the free expression of the emotion of <a2_0><b7_0>disgust<b7_0/><a2_0/> is considered socially unacceptable in most cultures. Some social institutions are seen as based on certain emotion, such as love in the case of contemporary institution of <a3_0><b8_0>marriage<b8_0/><a3_0/>. In advertising, such as health campaigns and political messages, emotional appeals are commonly found. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaigns emphasizing the <a4_0><b9_0>fear<b9_0/><a4_0/> of terrorism."}
