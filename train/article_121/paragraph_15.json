In history, scholars examine documents and other sources to interpret and analyze past activities; speculation on the emotional state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of interpretation. In literature and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and <a1_0><b6_0>romance<b6_0/><a1_0/>. In communication studies, scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages. Emotion is also studied in non-human animals in ethology, a branch of <a2_0><b7_0>zoology<b7_0/><a2_0/> which focuses on the scientific study of animal behavior. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and <a3_0><b8_0>field science<b8_0/><a3_0/>, with strong ties to <a4_0>ecology<a4_0/> and evolution. Ethologists often study one type of behavior (for example, aggression) in a number of unrelated animals."}
