In <a0_0><b5_0>sociology<b5_0/><a0_0/>, emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. In <a1_0>anthropology<a1_0/>, the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. Some <b6_0>anthropology<b6_0/> studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. In the field of <a2_0><b7_0>communication sciences<b7_0/><a2_0/>, critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to <a3_0><b8_0>Arlie Russell Hochschild<a3_0/>'s<b8_0/> concept of emotional labor. The University of Queensland hosts EmoNet, an e-mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings. The list was established in January 1997 and has over <a4_0>700<a4_0/> members from across the globe."}
