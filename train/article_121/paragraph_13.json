Griffiths<b4_0/><a0_0/> and Andrea Scarantino , emphasizes the importance of <a1_0><b5_0>external<b5_0/><a1_0/> factors in the development and communication of emotion, drawing upon the <a2_0>situationism<a2_0/> approach in psychology. This theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neo-Jamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a purely internal process, with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion. In contrast, a <b6_0>situationist<b6_0/> perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms. Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms. In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms. The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world. Griffiths and Scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding <a3_0><b7_0>phobias<b7_0/><a3_0/>, as well as the emotions of infants and animals."}
