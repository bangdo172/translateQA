Emotional dispositions are also comparable to <a1_0><b4_0>character traits<b4_0/><a1_0/>, where someone may be said to be generally disposed to experience certain emotions. For example, an irritable person is generally disposed to feel irritation more easily or quickly than others do. Finally, some theorists place emotions within a more general category of \"<a2_0><b5_0>affective states<b5_0/><a2_0/>\" where affective states can also include emotion-related phenomena such as pleasure and pain, motivational states (for example, hunger or curiosity), moods, dispositions and traits."}
