This theory is neo-Jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions, yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something, as is recognized by cognitive theories. The novel claim of this theory is that conceptually-based cognition is unnecessary for such meaning. Rather the bodily changes themselves perceive the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations. In this respect, emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch, which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways. A sophisticated defense of this view is found in <a4_0>philosopher<a4_0/> <b8_0>Jesse<b8_0/> Prinz's book <a1_0><b6_0>Gut Reactions<b6_0/><a1_0/>, and <a3_0>psychologist<a3_0/> James Laird's book <a2_0><b7_0>Feelings<b7_0/><a2_0/>."}
