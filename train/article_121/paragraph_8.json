James was an <a1_0>American<a1_0/> psychologist and <b6_0>philosopher<b6_0/> who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was a <a2_0>Danish<a2_0/> physician and psychologist. Working independently, they developed <a3_0>the <b8_0>James\u2013Lange theory<b8_0/><a3_0/>, a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions. The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause."}
