A further step can be taken by looking at the map's dimensions of the emotional experiences. The emotional experiences are divided into two dimensions known as <a3_0><b8_0>valence<b8_0/><a3_0/> (how negative or positive the experience feels) and <a1_0><a2_0><b6_0><b7_0>arousal<b7_0/><b6_0/><a2_0/><a1_0/> (how energized or enervated the experience feels). These two dimensions can be depicted on a 2D coordinate map. This two-dimensional map was theorized to capture one important component of emotion called <a4_0>core affect<a4_0/>. <b9_0>Core affect<b9_0/> is not the only component to emotion, but gives the emotion its hedonic and felt energy."}
