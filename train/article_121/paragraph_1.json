Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form <a3_0><b7_0>contempt<b7_0/><a3_0/>. Relationships exist between basic emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences."}
