Support for the Action Tendency Model (<b6_0>passivity<b6_0/> related to right prefrontal activity) comes from research on <a3_0><b7_0>shyness<b7_0/><a3_0/> and research on behavioral inhibition. Research that tested the competing hypotheses generated by all four models also supported the Action Tendency Model."}
