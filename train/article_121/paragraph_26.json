In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an \"exciting fact\" directly led to a physiological response, known as \"emotion.\" To account for different types of emotional experiences, James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in <a1_0>the <b6_0>autonomic nervous system<b6_0/><a1_0/>, which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish <a4_0>psychologist<a4_0/> <a3_0><b8_0>Carl Lange<b8_0/><a3_0/> also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the James\u2013Lange theory. As James wrote, \"<a2_0><b7_0>the perception of bodily changes<b7_0/><a2_0/>, as they occur, is the emotion.\" James further claims that \"we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and neither we cry, strike, nor tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be.\""}
