According to some theories, they are a state of feeling that results in physical and <a4_0>psychological<a4_0/> changes that influence our behavior.

Emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency. <a1_0><b6_0>Extroverted<b6_0/><a1_0/> people are more likely to be social and express their emotions, while <a2_0><b7_0>introverted<b7_0/><a2_0/> people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions. Emotion is often the driving force behind <a3_0>motivation<a3_0/>, positive or negative. Definition has been described as is a \"positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity.\" According to other theories, emotions are not causal forces but simply syndromes of components, which might include <b8_0>motivation<b8_0/>, feeling, behavior, and <b9_0>physiological<b9_0/> changes, but no one of these components is the emotion. Nor is the emotion an entity that causes these components"}
