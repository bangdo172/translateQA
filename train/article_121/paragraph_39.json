Weiss<b5_0/><a0_0/> and Russell Cropanzano (<a1_0><b6_0>1996<b6_0/><a1_0/>), that looks at the causes, structures, and consequences of emotional experience (especially in <a2_0><b7_0>work<b7_0/><a2_0/> contexts). This theory suggests that emotions are influenced and caused by events which in turn influence attitudes and behaviors. This theoretical frame also emphasizes time in that human beings experience what they call emotion episodes\u2014 a \"series of emotional states extended over time and organized around an underlying theme.\" This theory has been utilized by numerous researchers to better understand emotion from a communicative lens, and was reviewed further by <a3_0><b8_0>Howard M. Weiss<b8_0/><a3_0/> and Daniel J. Beal in their article, \"Reflections on Affective Events Theory\", published in <a4_0>Research on Emotion in Organizations<a4_0/> in 2005."}
