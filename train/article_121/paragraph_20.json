Solomon claims that emotions are <a2_0><b7_0>judgments<b7_0/><a2_0/>. He has put forward a more nuanced view which response to what he has called the \u2018standard objection\u2019 to <a4_0><b9_0>cognitivism<b9_0/><a4_0/>, the idea that a judgment that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion, so judgment cannot be identified with emotion. The theory proposed by <a3_0><b8_0>Nico Frijda<b8_0/><a3_0/> where appraisal leads to action tendencies is another example."}
