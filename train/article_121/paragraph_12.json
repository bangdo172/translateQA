He argued that physiological responses were <a2_0><b5_0>too slow and often imperceptible<b5_0/><a2_0/> and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion. He also believed that the richness, variety, and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions, that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses. An example of this theory in action is as follows: An emotion-evoking event (snake) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and <a1_0>a <b4_0>conscious experience of an emotion<b4_0/><a1_0/>."}
