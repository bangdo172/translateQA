She attended <a6_0>Huntingdon College<a6_0/> in Montgomery (1944\u201345), and then studied law at the <a7_0>University of Alabama<a7_0/> (1945\u201349). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time. In <a1_0>1950<a1_0/>, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a <a2_0>reservation clerk<a2_0/> for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at <a8_0>J. B. Lippincott<a8_0/> , who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing. Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year."}
