When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, <a2_0>Walter Cunningham<a2_0/>, at the Finch home one day, <a0_0>Calpurnia<a0_0/>, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so. Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable <a1_0>Aunt Alexandra<a1_0/>, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia. One writer notes that Scout, \"in Austenian fashion\", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify. Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: \"affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status\"."}
