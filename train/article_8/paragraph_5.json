Hohoff was impressed. \u201c[T]he spark of the true writer flashed in every line,\u201d she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott. But as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, \u201cmore a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.\u201d During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled To Kill a Mockingbird."}
