When Lee was <a0_0>10<a0_0/> years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named <a1_0>Walter Lett<a1_0/> of raping her. The story and the trial were covered by her father's newspaper which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death. After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there of tuberculosis in 1937. Scholars believe that Robinson's difficulties reflect the notorious case of the Scottsboro Boys, in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. However, in 2005, Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served \"the same purpose\" to <a4_0>display Southern prejudices<a4_0/>. <a2_0><a5_0>Emmett Till<a5_0/><a2_0/>, a black teenager who was murdered for flirting with a white woman in Mississippi in 1955, and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the <a3_0>Civil Rights Movement<a3_0/>, is also considered a model for Tom Robinson."}
