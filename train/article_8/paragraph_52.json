The first part of the novel concerns the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in <a0_0>the neighborhood<a0_0/>. Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as <a1_0>Southern romantic regionalism<a1_0/>. This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of \"<a2_0>fine folks<a2_0/>\" being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. <a3_0>The South itself<a3_0/>, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters."}
