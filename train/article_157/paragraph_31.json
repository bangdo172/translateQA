As <a1_0>Kelvin MacKenzie<a1_0/>, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true\u2014so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September <b5_0><b6_0>1986<b6_0/><b5_0/>: \"The <a2_0>royal soap opera<a2_0/> has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the <b7_0>Social Democratic Party<b7_0/>\u2014<a3_0>Thatcher's political opponents<a3_0/>. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift\u2014membership in the Order of Merit and the <b8_0>Order of the Garter<b8_0/>\u2014to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by <b9_0>John Major<b9_0/>. Former Canadian Prime Minister <a4_0>Brian Mulroney<a4_0/> said Elizabeth was a \"behind the scenes force\" in ending apartheid."}
