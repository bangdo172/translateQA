The two princesses were educated <a2_0>at home<a2_0/> under the supervision of their mother and their <a3_0>governess<a3_0/>, Marion Crawford, who was casually known as \"Crawfie\". Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music. Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled <a4_0>The Little Princesses<a4_0/> in <b8_0>1950<b8_0/>, much to the dismay of the royal family. The book describes Elizabeth's love of <b6_0>horses and dogs<b6_0/>, her orderliness, and her <b7_0>attitude of responsibility<b7_0/>. Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as \"a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant.\" Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as \"a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved\"."}
