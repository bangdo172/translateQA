The Queen was on holiday with her extended family at <b7_0><b8_0>Balmoral<b8_0/><b7_0/>. Diana's two sons by Charles\u2014Princes William and Harry\u2014wanted to attend church and so the Queen and Prince Philip took them that morning. After that single public appearance, for <a2_0>five days<a2_0/> the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private, but the royal family's seclusion and the failure to <a3_0>fly a flag at half-mast<a3_0/> over Buckingham Palace caused public dismay. Pressured by the hostile reaction, the Queen agreed to return to <b5_0>London<b5_0/> and do a <a4_0>live television broadcast<a4_0/> on 5 <b6_0>September<b6_0/>, the day before Diana's funeral. In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings \"as a grandmother\" for the two princes. As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated."}
