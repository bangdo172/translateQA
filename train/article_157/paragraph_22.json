Police later discovered that the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, <a1_0>Marcus Sarjeant<a1_0/>, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after <b9_0>three<b9_0/>. The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.

On 9 <b6_0>July<b6_0/>, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, <a3_0>Michael Fagan<a3_0/>, in the room with her. Remaining calm and through two calls to the Palace police switchboard, she spoke to Fagan while he sat at the foot of her bed until assistance arrived seven minutes later. Though she hosted US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visited his Californian ranch in <b5_0>1983<b5_0/>, she was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of <a4_0>Grenada<a4_0/>, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her."}
