Every NFL team plays exactly <a0_0><b5_0><b7_0>four<b5_0/><a0_0/> pre-season exhibition games<b7_0/> a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, <a1_0>the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game<a1_0/>. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of <a2_0>August<a2_0/>, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of <a3_0>90<a3_0/> players to the regular-season limit of <a4_0>53<a4_0/> players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in <b9_0>1976.<b9_0/> Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.[citation needed] <b8_0>The Pro Bowl,<b8_0/> traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game."}
