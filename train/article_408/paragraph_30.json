While the National Revolutionary Movement government begun in 1952 discouraged self-identification as indigenous (reclassifying rural people as campesinos, or peasants), renewed <a3_0>ethnic and class militancy<a3_0/> re-emerged in the Katarista movement beginning in the 1970s. Lowland indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 <a4_0>March for Territory and Dignity<a4_0/> organized by the CIDOB confederation. That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ILO Convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and titling indigenous territories. The 1994 Law of Popular Participation granted \"grassroots territorial organizations\" that are recognized by the state certain rights to govern local areas."}
