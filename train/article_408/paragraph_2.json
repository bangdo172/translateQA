The Americas came to be known as the \"<a2_0>West Indies<a2_0/>\", a name still used to refer to the islands of the Caribbean Sea. This led to the names \"Indies\" and \"Indian\", which implied <a3_0>some kind of racial or cultural unity<a3_0/> among the aboriginal peoples of the Americas. This unifying concept, codified in law, religion, and politics, was not originally accepted by indigenous peoples but has been embraced by many over the last two centuries.[citation needed] Even though the term \"Indian\" does not include the Aleuts, Inuit, or Yupik peoples, these groups are considered <a4_0>indigenous<a4_0/> peoples of the Americas."}
