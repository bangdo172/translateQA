The largest indigenous group in Nicaragua is the <a1_0>Miskito<a1_0/> people. Their territory extended from Cape Camar\u00f3n, Honduras, to Rio Grande, Nicaragua along the Mosquito Coast. There is a native Miskito language, but large groups speak Miskito Coast Creole, Spanish, Rama and other languages. The Creole English came about through <a2_0>frequent contact with the British<a2_0/> who colonized the area. Many are Christians. Traditional Miskito society was highly structured with a defined political structure. There was a king, but he did not have <a3_0>total power<a3_0/>. Instead, the power was split between himself, a governor, a general, and by the 1750s, an admiral. Historical information on kings is often obscured by the fact that many of the kings were semi-mythical.
