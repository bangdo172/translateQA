It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the <a2_0>spoken language of its community<a2_0/>. In total, the script has <a3_0>more than one thousand<a3_0/> different glyphs although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, <a4_0>some two hundred<a4_0/> of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation."}
