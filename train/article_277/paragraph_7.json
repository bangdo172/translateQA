Also, to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself, the desert is made even drier by his <b4_0>geographical configuration and location<b4_0/>. Indeed, <b5_0>the extreme aridity of <b11_0>the Sahara<b11_0/><b5_0/> can't be only explained by the <b7_0>subtropical high pressure<b7_0/>. <b6_0><b9_0>The <a1_0>Atlas Mountains<b9_0/><b6_0/><a1_0/>, found in <a2_0><b8_0>Algeria<a2_0/>, Morocco and Tunisia<b8_0/> also help to enhance the aridity of the northern part of the desert. These major mountain ranges act as a barrier causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the polar front which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates."}
