By the <b5_0>5th millennium BCE<b5_0/>, the people who inhabited what is now called Nubia, were full participants in the \"agricultural revolution\", living <b7_0>a settled lifestyle with domesticated plants and animals<b7_0/>.

This complexity, as observed at Nabta Playa, and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there, likely formed the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the Old Kingdom of Egypt."}
