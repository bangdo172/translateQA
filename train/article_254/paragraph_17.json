In Africa, colonial administrators encouraged traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. <a0_0>Millions<a0_0/> of children worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries. Sophisticated schemes were promulgated where children in these colonies between the ages of <a3_0>5\u201314<a3_0/> were hired as an apprentice <a1_0>without pay<a1_0/> in exchange for learning a craft. A system of Pauper Apprenticeship came into practice in the <a4_0>19th<a4_0/> century where the colonial master neither needed the native parents' nor child's approval to assign a child to labour, away from parents, at a distant farm owned by a different colonial master. Other schemes included 'earn-and-learn' programs where children would work and thereby learn. Britain for example passed a law, the so-called Masters and Servants Act of 1899, followed by Tax and Pass Law, to encourage child labour in colonies particularly in Africa. These laws offered the native people the legal ownership to some of the native land in exchange for making labour of wife and children available to colonial government's needs such as in farms and as picannins."}
