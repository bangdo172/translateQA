The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in <a4_0>1803<a4_0/>. As early as 1802 and 1819 Factory Acts were passed to regulate the working hours of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the \"Short Time Committees\" in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11\u201318 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9\u201311 a maximum of eight hours, and <a1_0>children under the age of nine<a1_0/> were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in <a2_0>1847<a2_0/> limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days. <a0_0>Lord Shaftesbury<a0_0/> was an outspoken advocate of regulating child labour."}
