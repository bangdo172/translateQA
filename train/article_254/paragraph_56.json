During the Industrial Revolution many of these children moved from farm work to <a2_0>factory work<a2_0/>. Over time, as real wages rose, parents became able to afford to <a3_0>send their children to school instead of work<a3_0/> and as a result child labour declined, both before and after legislation. Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard said that British and American children of the pre- and post-Industrial Revolution lived and suffered in infinitely worse conditions where jobs were not available for them and went \"voluntarily and gladly\" to work in factories."}
