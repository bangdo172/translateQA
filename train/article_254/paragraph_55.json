For example, a UNICEF study found that after the Child Labour Deterrence Act was introduced in the US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in Bangladesh, leaving many to resort to jobs such as \"<a1_0>stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution\"<a1_0/>, jobs that are \"more hazardous and exploitative than garment production\".
