Yet due to a change in the dictatorship by the military in the 80\u2019s, the minimum age restriction was reduced to the age of twelve but was reviewed due to reports of dangerous and hazardous working conditions in 1988. This led to the minimum age being raised once again to 14. Another set of restrictions was passed in <a1_0>1998<a1_0/> that restricted the kinds of work youth could partake in, such as work that was considered hazardous like running construction equipment, or certain kinds of factory work. Although many steps were taken to reduce the risk and occurrence of child labour, <a2_0>there is still a high number of children and adolescents working under the age of fourteen in Brazil<a2_0/>. It was not until recently in the 80\u2019s that it was discovered that <a3_0>almost nine million<a3_0/> children in Brazil were working illegally and not partaking in traditional childhood activities that help to develop important life experiences."}
