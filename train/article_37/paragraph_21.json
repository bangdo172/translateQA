In <b6_0>ancient times, in the first centuries after the birth of Christ<b6_0/>, when this region was called[by whom?] <a0_0>Scythia<a0_0/> - Christians already lived there. Later the region saw the first states to adopt Christianity officially - initially in <a1_0>Armenia<a1_0/> (<a2_0>301 AD<a2_0/>) and in <b7_0>Georgia<b7_0/> (<a3_0><b8_0>337 AD<b8_0/><a3_0/>), later in the Great Russian Principality (Kyivan Rus, Russian: \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435, ca 988 AD). People of that time used to denote themselves Christians (\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0435) and Russians (\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435). Both terms had strong Christian connotations.[citation needed] It is also interesting that in time the term \"\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0435\" acquired the meaning \"peasants of Christian faith\" and later \"peasants\" (the main part of the population of the region), while the term \"\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0435\" retained its religious meaning and the term \"<b9_0>\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435<b9_0/>\" began to mean representatives of the heterogeneous Russian nation formed on the basis of common Christian faith and language,[citation needed] which strongly influenced the history and development of the region. In the region the \"<a4_0>Pravoslav faith<a4_0/>\" (\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0430 - Orthodox faith) or \"Russian faith\" (\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0430) from earliest times became almost as known as the original \"Christian faith\" (\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0430). Also in some contexts the term \"cossack\" (\u043a\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043a, \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a - free man by the will of God) was used[by whom?] to denote \"free\" Christians of steppe origin and Russian language."}
