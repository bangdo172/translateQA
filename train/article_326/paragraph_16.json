In 1932 IBM created an <b6_0>Education Department<b6_0/> to oversee training for employees, which oversaw the completion of the <a1_0>IBM Schoolhouse at Endicott<a1_0/> in 1933. In 1935, the employee magazine <a2_0><b9_0>Think<b9_0/><a2_0/> was created. Also that year, IBM held <b7_0>its first training class<b7_0/> for female systems service professionals. In 1942, IBM launched a <a3_0>program to train and employ <b8_0>disabled people<b8_0/><a3_0/> in Topeka, Kansas. The next year classes began in New York City, and soon the company was asked to join the President's Committee for Employment of the Handicapped. In <a4_0>1946<a4_0/>, the company hired its first black salesman, 18 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1947, IBM announced a Total and Permanent Disability Income Plan for employees. A vested rights pension was added to the IBM retirement plan. During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s revisions were made to these pension plans to reduce IBM's pension liabilities."}
