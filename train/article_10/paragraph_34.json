Entertainment Weekly's <a1_0>Simon Vozick-Levinson<a1_0/> perceives that such elements \"all recur at various points\", namely \"the luxurious soul of 2004's The College Dropout, the symphonic pomp of Late Registration, the gloss of 2007's Graduation, and the emotionally exhausted electro of 2008's <a4_0>808s & Heartbreak<a4_0/>\". Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice writes that West \"absorb[ed] the gifts of his handpicked collaborators, and occasionally elevat[ed] them\" on previous studio albums, noting collaborators and elements as <a2_0>Jon Brion<a2_0/> for Late Registration, <a3_0>DJ Toomp<a3_0/> for Graduation, and Kid Cudi for 808s & Heartbreak."}
