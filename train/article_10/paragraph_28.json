Later that month, West was awarded an honorary doctorate by the <a4_0>School of the <a1_0>Art Institute of Chicago<a4_0/><a1_0/> for his contributions to music, fashion, and popular culture, officially making him an honorary DFA. The next month, West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, despite a petition signed by almost <a2_0><a5_0>135,000<a5_0/><a2_0/> people against his appearance. At one point, he told the audience: \"You are now watching the greatest living rock star on the planet.\" Media outlets, including social media sites such as Twitter, were sharply divided on his performance. NME stated, \"The decision to book West for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement, and the show itself appeared to polarise both Glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch on their TVs.\" The publication added that \"he's letting his music speak for and prove itself.\" The Guardian said that \"his set has a potent ferocity \u2013 but there are gaps and stutters, and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front of the vast crowd.\""}
