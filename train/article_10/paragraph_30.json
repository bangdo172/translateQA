When asked about his musical inspirations, he has named A Tribe Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, George Michael, LL Cool J, Phil Collins and Madonna as early interests. He has further described musician <a0_0><a3_0>David Bowie<a3_0/><a0_0/> as one of his \"most important inspirations,\" and named producer <a4_0>Puff Daddy<a4_0/> as the \"most important cultural figure in my life.\" Early in his career, West pioneered a style of production dubbed \"<a2_0>chipmunk soul<a2_0/>\" which utilized pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul and R&B songs, along with his own drums and instrumentation. His first major release featuring his trademark soulful vocal sampling style was <a5_0>\"This Can't Be Life\"<a5_0/>, a track from Jay-Z\u2019s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West has said that <a1_0>Wu-Tang Clan<a1_0/> producer RZA influenced him in his style, and has named Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah and Ol' Dirty Bastard as inspirations. RZA spoke positively of the comparisons, stating in an interview for Rolling Stone, \"All good. I got super respect for Kanye [...] [he] is going to inspire people to be like him.\" West further developed his style on his 2004 debut album, The College Dropout. After a rough version was leaked, he meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, and improved drum programming."}
