In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark Fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit <a4_0>\"All of the Lights\"<a4_0/>, and Billboard hits \"Power\", \"Monster\", and \"Runaway\", the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name. During this time, West initiated the free music program <a5_0>GOOD Fridays<a5_0/> through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday, a portion of which were included on the album. This promotion ran from August 20 - December 17, 2010. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for <a1_0>Album of the Year<a1_0/> at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a \"snub\" by several media outlets."}
