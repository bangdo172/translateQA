Months later, West and fianc\u00e9e <a0_0><a3_0>Alexis Phifer<a3_0/><a0_0/> ended their engagement and their long-term intermittent relationship, which had begun in 2002. The events profoundly affected West, who set off for his 2008 <a4_0>Glow in the Dark Tour<a4_0/> shortly thereafter. Purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping, West decided to sing using the voice audio processor <a1_0>Auto-Tune<a1_0/>, which would become a central part of his next effort. West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album The College Dropout for the background vocals of \"Jesus Walks\" and \"Never Let Me Down.\" Recorded mostly in Honolulu, <a5_0>Hawaii<a5_0/> in three weeks, West announced his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak, at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed its lead single, <a6_0>\"Love Lockdown\"<a6_0/>. Music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of Auto-Tune, which typified the pre-release response to the record."}
