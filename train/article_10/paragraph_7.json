His first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on Down to Earth, the 1996 debut album of a Chicago rapper named Grav. For a time, West acted as a ghost producer for <a5_0>Deric \"D-Dot\" Angelettie<a5_0/>. Because of his association with D-Dot, West wasn't able to release a solo album, so he formed and became a member and producer of the <a2_0><a6_0>Go-Getters<a6_0/><a2_0/>, a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him, GLC, Timmy G, Really Doe, and Arrowstar. His group was managed by John \"Monopoly\" Johnson, Don Crowley, and Happy Lewis under the management firm <a7_0>Hustle Period<a7_0/>. After attending a series of promotional photo shoots and making some radio appearances, The Go-Getters released their first and only studio album World Record Holders in <a8_0>1999<a8_0/>. The album featured other Chicago-based rappers such as Rhymefest, Mikkey Halsted, Miss Criss, and Shayla G. Meanwhile, the production was handled by West, Arrowstar, Boogz, and Brian \"All Day\" Miller."}
