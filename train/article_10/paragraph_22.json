He was subsequently withdrawn from the remainder of the show for his actions. West's tour with <a2_0><a5_0>Lady Gaga<a5_0/><a2_0/> was cancelled in response to the controversy, and it was suggested that the incident was partially responsible for 808s & Heartbreak's lack of nominations at the <a6_0>52nd Grammy Awards<a6_0/>."}
