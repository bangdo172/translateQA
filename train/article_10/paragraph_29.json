He announced in January 2016 on Twitter that SWISH would be released on <a0_0>February 11<a0_0/>, after releasing new song \"Real Friends\" and a snippet of \"No More Parties in L.A.\" with Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from SWISH to <a1_0><a6_0>Waves<a6_0/><a1_0/>, and also announced the premier of his <a8_0>Yeezy Season 3<a8_0/> clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In early 2016, several weeks prior to the release of his new album, West became embroiled in a short-lived social media altercation with rapper <a2_0><a7_0>Wiz Khalifa<a7_0/><a2_0/> on Twitter that eventually involved their mutual ex-partner, Amber Rose, who protested to West's mention of her and Khalifa's child. The feud involved allegations by Rose concerning her sexual relationship with West, and received significant media attention. As of February 2, 2016, West and Khalifa had reconciled. Several days ahead of the album's release, West again changed the title, this time to <a3_0>The Life of Pablo<a3_0/>. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track \"Waves\" at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper. He released the album exclusively on <a4_0>Tidal<a4_0/> on 14 February 2016 following a performance on SNL."}
