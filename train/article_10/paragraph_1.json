In 2010, he released his critically acclaimed fifth album, the maximalist My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and the following year he collaborated with Jay-Z on the joint LP Watch the Throne (2011).

Following a series of recording delays and work on non-musical projects, West's seventh album, The Life of Pablo, was released in 2016."}
