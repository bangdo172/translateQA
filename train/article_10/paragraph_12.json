The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded a song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. The composition, <a4_0>\"<a0_0>Through The Wire<a0_0/>\"<a4_0/>, expressed West's experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album, as according to West \"all the better artists have expressed what they were going through\". West added that \"the album was my medicine\", as working on the record distracted him from the pain. \"Through The Wire\" was first available on West's <a1_0><a5_0>Get Well Soon<a5_0/>...<a1_0/> mixtape, released December 2002. At the same time, West announced that he was working on an album called <a2_0>The College Dropout<a2_0/>, whose overall theme was to \"make your own decisions. Don't let society tell you, 'This is what you have to do.'\""}
