Most of the city centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In <a3_0>1962<a3_0/> the modernist high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of mid twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece allowed to fall into disrepair by its owner Plymouth City Council but recently <a4_0>grade II<a4_0/> listed by English Heritage to prevent its demolition."}
