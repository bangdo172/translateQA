In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of <a4_0>East Stonehouse<a4_0/> were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in <a1_0>1928<a1_0/>, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during World War II, an act known as the <a2_0>Plymouth Blitz<a2_0/>. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in <a3_0>1967<a3_0/>."}
