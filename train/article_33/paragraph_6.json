In 1403 the town was burned by <a1_0>Breton raiders<a1_0/>. In the late fifteenth century a 'castle quadrate' was constructed close to the area now known as The Barbican; it included four round towers, one at each corner, as featured on the city coat of arms. The castle served to protect <a3_0>Sutton Pool<a3_0/>, which is where the fleet was based in Plymouth prior to the establishment of Plymouth Dockyard. In <a4_0>1512<a4_0/> an Act of Parliament was passed for further fortifying Plymouth, and a series of fortifications were then built, including defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain would be extended in time of danger). Defences on St Nicholas Island also date from this time, and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built, including one on Fishers Nose at the south-eastern corner of the Hoe. This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake's Fort) in <a2_0>1596<a2_0/>, which itself went on to provide the site for the Citadel, established in the 1660s (see below)."}
