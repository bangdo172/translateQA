Local limestone may be seen in numerous buildings, walls and pavements throughout Plymouth. To the north and north east of the city is the granite mass of <a1_0>Dartmoor<a1_0/>; the granite was mined and exported via Plymouth. Rocks brought down the <a2_0>Tamar<a2_0/> from Dartmoor include ores containing tin, copper, tungsten, lead and other minerals. There is evidence that the middle Devonian limestone belt at the south edge of Plymouth and in Plymstock was quarried at West Hoe, <a3_0>Cattedown<a3_0/> and Radford."}
