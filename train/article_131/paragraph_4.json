One side views the war as a necessary part of the <a0_0><b5_0>Containment<b5_0/><a0_0/> policy, which allowed the enemy to choose the time and place of warfare. Others note the U.S. made major strategic gains as the Communists were defeated in <a1_0><b6_0>Indonesia<b6_0/><a1_0/>, and by 1972 both Moscow and Beijing were competing for American support, at the expense of their allies in Hanoi. Critics see the conflict as <a2_0>a \"<b7_0>quagmire<b7_0/>\"<a2_0/>\u2014an endless waste of American blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern US interests. Fears of another quagmire have been major factors in foreign policy debates ever since. The draft became extremely unpopular, and <b9_0>President Nixon<b9_0/> ended it in <a3_0><a4_0><b8_0>1973<b8_0/><a4_0/><a3_0/>, forcing the military (the Army especially) to rely entirely upon volunteers. That raised the issue of how well the professional military reflected overall American society and values; the soldiers typically took the position that their service represented the highest and best American values."}
