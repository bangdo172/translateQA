The reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military strategists and academics. There is general agreement that <a0_0><b5_0>US technological superiority<b5_0/><a0_0/> was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to <a1_0><b6_0>poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale<b6_0/><a1_0/> among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities <a2_0>on <b7_0>17 January 1991<b7_0/><a2_0/>, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran, where they were interned for the duration of the conflict. The overwhelming technological advantages of the US, such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights, quickly turned the air war into a \"turkey shoot\". The heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target. Air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft. Grainy video clips, shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly small targets, were a staple of US news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war, compared by some to a video game. Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters, the Iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat, under orders from <a4_0><b9_0>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein<b9_0/><a4_0/>, and by the time the ground forces invaded on <a3_0><b8_0>24 February<b8_0/><a3_0/>, many Iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one instance, Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces."}
