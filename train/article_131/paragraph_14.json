The Navy and Marine Corps followed this up with an <a2_0><b7_0>island hopping<b7_0/><a2_0/> campaign across the central and south Pacific in 1943\u201345, reaching the outskirts of Japan in the Battle of Okinawa. During 1942 and 1943, the U.S. deployed millions of men and thousands of planes and tanks to the UK, beginning with the strategic bombing of Nazi Germany and occupied Europe and leading up to the Allied invasions of occupied North Africa in November <a3_0><b8_0>1942<b8_0/><a3_0/>, Sicily and Italy in 1943, France in 1944, and the invasion of Germany in 1945, parallel with the Soviet invasion from the east. That led to the surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945. In the Pacific, the U.S. experienced much success in naval campaigns during 1944, but bloody battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945 led the U.S. to look for a way to end the war with minimal loss of American lives. The U.S. used atomic bombs on <a4_0><b9_0>Hiroshima and Nagasaki<b9_0/><a4_0/> to destroy the Japanese war effort and to shock the Japanese leadership, which quickly caused the surrender of Japan."}
