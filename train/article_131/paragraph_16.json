North Korean forces struck massively in the summer of <a0_0><b5_0>1950<b5_0/><a0_0/> and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK defenders into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming <a4_0>Douglas MacArthur<a4_0/> commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around <a1_0><b6_0>Pusan<b6_0/><a1_0/>, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an <a2_0><b7_0>amphibious invasion<b7_0/><a2_0/> well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed <a3_0>the <b8_0>Yalu River<b8_0/><a3_0/> in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. <b9_0>MacArthur<b9_0/> argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy."}
