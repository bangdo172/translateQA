During a raid in downtown <a2_0>Mogadishu<a2_0/>, US troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the Battle of <b7_0>Mogadishu<b7_0/>. <a3_0><b8_0>Eighteen<b8_0/><a3_0/> American soldiers were killed, and a US television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob. Somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated 1,000\u20135,000 total casualties during the conflict. After much public disapproval, American forces were quickly withdrawn by President Bill Clinton. The incident profoundly affected US thinking about peacekeeping and intervention. The book <a4_0><b9_0>Black Hawk Down<b9_0/><a4_0/> was written about the battle, and was the basis for the later movie of the same name."}
