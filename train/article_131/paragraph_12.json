The Navy was well-prepared and won laurels, even as politicians tried (and failed) to have it redeployed to defend East Coast cities against potential threats from the feeble Spanish fleet. The Army performed well in combat in <a0_0><b5_0>Cuba<b5_0/><a0_0/>. However, it was too oriented to small posts in the West and not as well-prepared for an overseas conflict. It relied on <a1_0><b6_0>volunteers and state militia<b6_0/><a1_0/> units, which faced logistical, training and food problems in the staging areas in Florida. The United States freed Cuba (after an occupation by the U.S. Army). By the peace treaty Spain ceded to the United States its colonies of <a2_0><b7_0>Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines<b7_0/><a2_0/>. The Navy set up coaling stations there and in <a3_0><b8_0>Hawaii<b8_0/><a3_0/> (which voluntarily joined the U.S. in 1898). The U.S. Navy now had a major forward presence across the Pacific and (with the lease of <a4_0><b9_0>Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base<b9_0/><a4_0/> in Cuba) a major base in the Caribbean guarding the approaches to the Gulf Coast and the Panama Canal."}
