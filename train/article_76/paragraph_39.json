In his speech before the Federal Assembly he introduced <a2_0>20<a2_0/> sweeping constitutional amendments that would provide an updated framework on which the country would be based. The amendments provided for a collective presidency, a 22-member body consisting of elected representatives from six republics and two autonomous provinces. The body would have a single chairman of the presidency and chairmanship would rotate among six republics. When the Federal Assembly fails to agree on legislation, the collective presidency would have the power to rule by decree. Amendments also provided for stronger cabinet with considerable power to initiate and pursue legislature independently from the Communist Party. D\u017eemal <a3_0>Bijedi\u0107<a3_0/> was chosen as the Premier. The new amendments aimed to decentralize the country by granting greater autonomy to republics and provinces. The <a4_0>federal<a4_0/> government would retain authority only over foreign affairs, defense, internal security, monetary affairs, free trade within Yugoslavia, and development loans to poorer regions. Control of education, healthcare, and housing would be exercised entirely by the governments of the republics and the autonomous provinces."}
