Several of these places have since returned to their original names, such as <a0_0>Podgorica<a0_0/>, formerly Titograd (though Podgorica's international airport is still identified by the code TGD), and U\u017eice, formerly Titovo U\u017eice, which reverted to its original name in <a1_0>1992<a1_0/>. Streets in Belgrade, the capital, have all reverted to their original pre\u2013World War II and pre-communist names as well. In 2004, Antun Augustin\u010di\u0107's statue of Broz in his birthplace of <a2_0>Kumrovec<a2_0/> was decapitated in an explosion. It was subsequently repaired. Twice in 2008, protests took place in Zagreb's Marshal Tito Square, organized by a group called Circle for the Square (Krug za Trg), with an aim to force the city government to rename it to its previous name, while a counter-protest by Citizens' Initiative Against Usta\u0161ism (Gra\u0111anska inicijativa protiv usta\u0161tva) accused the \"Circle for the Square\" of historical revisionism and neo-fascism. <a3_0>Croatian<a3_0/> president Stjepan Mesi\u0107 criticized the demonstration to change the name. In the Croatian coastal city of Opatija the main street (also its longest street) still bears the name of Marshal Tito, as do streets in numerous towns in Serbia, mostly in the country's north. One of the main streets in downtown Sarajevo is called Marshal Tito Street, and Tito's statue in a park in front of the university campus (ex. JNA barrack \"Mar\u0161al Tito\") in Marijin Dvor is a place where Bosnians and Sarajevans still today commemorate and pay tribute to Tito (image on the right). The largest Tito monument in the world, about 10 m (33 ft) high, is located at Tito Square (Slovene: Titov trg), the central square in Velenje, <a4_0>Slovenia<a4_0/>. One of the main bridges in Slovenia's second largest city of Maribor is Tito Bridge (Titov most). The central square in Koper, the largest Slovenian port city, is as well named Tito Square."}
