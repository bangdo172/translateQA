The agreement also eased tensions, which had prevented the naming of new bishops in Yugoslavia since 1945. Tito's new socialism met opposition from traditional communists culminating in conspiracy headed by Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107. In the same year Tito declared that Communists must henceforth chart Yugoslavia's course by the force of their arguments (implying an abandonment of <a4_0>Leninist<a4_0/> orthodoxy and development of liberal Communism). The State Security Administration (<a2_0><a3_0>UDBA<a3_0/><a2_0/>) saw its power scaled back and its staff reduced to 5000."}
