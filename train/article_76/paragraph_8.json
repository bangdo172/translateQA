He was appointed to the Committee and started to appoint allies to him, among them Edvard Kardelj, Milovan \u0110ilas, Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107 and Boris Kidri\u010d. In 1935, Tito travelled to the Soviet Union, working for a year in the Balkans section of Comintern. He was a member of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet secret police (NKVD). Tito was also involved in recruiting for the Dimitrov Battalion, a group of volunteers serving in the Spanish Civil War. In 1936, the Comintern sent \"Comrade Walter\" (i.e. <a4_0>Tito<a4_0/>) back to Yugoslavia to purge the Communist Party there. In 1937, Stalin had the Secretary-General of the CPY, <a1_0>Milan Gorki\u0107<a1_0/>, murdered in <a2_0>Moscow<a2_0/>. Subsequently <a3_0>Tito<a3_0/> was appointed Secretary-General of the still-outlawed CPY."}
