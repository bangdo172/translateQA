King Peter II, American President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined Soviet Premier Joseph <a2_0>Stalin<a2_0/> in officially recognising Tito and the Partisans at the <a3_0>Tehran Conference<a3_0/>. This resulted in Allied aid being parachuted behind Axis lines to assist the Partisans. On 17 June 1944 on the Dalmatian island of Vis, the Treaty of Vis (Vi\u0161ki sporazum) was signed in an attempt to merge Tito's government (the AVNOJ) with the government in exile of King Peter II. The Balkan Air Force was formed in June <a4_0>1944<a4_0/> to control operations that were mainly aimed at aiding his forces."}
