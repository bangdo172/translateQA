By 1974 the Yugoslav President had at his disposal 32 official residences, larger and small, the yacht <a1_0>Galeb<a1_0/> (\"<a4_0>seagull<a4_0/>\"), a Boeing 727 as the presidential airplane, and the Blue Train. After Tito's death the presidential Boeing 727 was sold to <a2_0>Aviogenex<a2_0/>, the Galeb remained docked in <a3_0>Montenegro<a3_0/>, while the Blue Train was stored in a Serbian train shed for over two decades. While Tito was the person who held the office of president for by far the longest period, the associated property was not private and much of it continues to be in use by Yugoslav successor states, as public property, or maintained at the disposal of high-ranking officials."}
