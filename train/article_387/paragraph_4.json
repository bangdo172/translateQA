For example, the 2005\u201306 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than <a0_0><b5_0>goalkeeper<b5_0/><a0_0/>, but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to <a1_0><b6_0>score goals<b6_0/><a1_0/>; <a2_0><b7_0>defenders<b7_0/><a2_0/>, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a <a3_0><b8_0>formation<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the <a4_0><b9_0>team's manager<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
