The Cambridge Rules were written at <a1_0><b6_0>Trinity College<b6_0/><a1_0/>, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in <a3_0><b8_0>1867<b8_0/><a3_0/>. In <a2_0><b7_0>1862<b7_0/><a2_0/>, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules."}
