An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the <a0_0><b5_0>National Archaeological Museum of Athens<b5_0/><a0_0/> appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup. Athenaeus, writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball game <a1_0><b6_0>harpastum<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football. As with pre-codified \"mob football\", the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking. Non-competitive games included <a2_0><b7_0>kemari<b7_0/><a2_0/> in Japan, chuk-guk in <a3_0><b8_0>Korea<b8_0/><a3_0/> and woggabaliri in <a4_0><b9_0>Australia<b9_0/><a4_0/>."}
