These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when <a1_0><b6_0>the first goal in extra time<b6_0/><a1_0/> was scored (golden goal), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (silver goal). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was <a2_0><b7_0>France<b7_0/><a2_0/>'s victory over <a3_0><b8_0>Paraguay<b8_0/><a3_0/> in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro <a4_0><b9_0>1996<b9_0/><a4_0/>. Silver goal was used in Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB."}
