If anything, there is recognition that living up to one's potential is hard work and requires the help of others. The ultimate goal is <a1_0><b5_0>human flourishing<b5_0/><a1_0/>; <a2_0><b6_0>making life better<a2_0/> for all humans<b6_0/>, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole. The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher <b8_0>Alfred North Whitehead<b8_0/> cautioned: \"The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts\"."}
