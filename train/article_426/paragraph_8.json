The <a1_0><b5_0>Silver Rule of Confucianism<b5_0/><a1_0/> from Analects XV.24, is an example of ethical philosophy based on human values rather than the supernatural. Humanistic thought is also contained in other Confucian classics, e.g., as recorded in <a3_0><b7_0>Zuo Zhuan<b7_0/><a3_0/>, <a2_0><b6_0>Ji Liang<b6_0/><a2_0/> says, \"People is the zhu (master, lord, dominance, owner or origin) of gods. So, to sage kings, people first, gods second\"; Neishi Guo says, \"Gods, clever, righteous and wholehearted, comply with human.\" Taoist and Confucian secularism contain elements of moral thought devoid of religious authority or deism however they only partly resembled our modern concept of secularism."}
