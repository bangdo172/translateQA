Comte had proposed an <a1_0><b5_0>atheistic<b5_0/><a1_0/> culte founded on human principles \u2013 a secular <b6_0>Religion of Humanity<b6_0/> (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism. Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a <a2_0>religion of humanity<a2_0/>. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to \"vivre pour altrui\" (\"live for others\", from which comes the word \"<a3_0><b7_0>altruism<b7_0/><a3_0/>\"), and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy."}
