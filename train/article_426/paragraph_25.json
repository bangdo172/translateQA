Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of \"humanism\" until the late <a1_0><b5_0>19th and early 20th centuries<b5_0/><a1_0/>, non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history. The Cult of Reason (French: Culte de la Raison) was a religion based on deism devised during the French Revolution by <a2_0><b6_0>Jacques H\u00e9bert<b6_0/><a2_0/>, Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and their supporters. In <a3_0><b7_0>1793<b7_0/><a3_0/> during the French Revolution, the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris was turned into a \"Temple to Reason\" and for a time <b8_0>Lady Liberty<b8_0/> replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars. In the 1850s, Auguste Comte, the Father of Sociology, founded Positivism, a \"religion of humanity\". One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts. The Ethical Culture movement was founded in 1876. The movement's founder, Felix Adler, a former member of the Free Religious Association, conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern."}
