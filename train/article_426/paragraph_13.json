Erasmus, along with the French humanist Jacques <a1_0>Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples<a1_0/>, began issuing new translations, laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Henceforth Renaissance humanism, particularly in the <b5_0>German North<b5_0/>, became concerned with religion, while Italian and <b6_0>French humanism<b6_0/> concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists, studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith. After the Reformation, critical examination of <a2_0><b4_0>the Bible<b4_0/><a2_0/> did not resume until the advent of the so-called Higher criticism of the 19th-century German <b7_0>T\u00fcbingen school<b7_0/>."}
