Gellius became a favorite author in the <a2_0><b7_0>Italian Renaissance<b7_0/><a2_0/>, and, in fifteenth-century Italy, teachers and scholars of philosophy, poetry, and rhetoric were called and called themselves \"humanists\". Modern scholars, however, point out that Cicero (106 \u2013 43 BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas, in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For <b8_0>Cicero<b8_0/>, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was <a4_0><b9_0>speech<b9_0/><a4_0/>, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law. Thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, humanism, which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship."}
