The re-discovery of <a0_0><b4_0>ancient manuscripts<b4_0/><a0_0/> brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as Epicureanism, and Neoplatonism, whose Pagan wisdom the humanists, like the <a1_0><b5_0>Church fathers<b5_0/><a1_0/> of old, tended, at least initially, to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue. The line from a drama of Terence, Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto (or with nil for nihil), meaning \"I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me\", known since antiquity through the endorsement of <a2_0><b6_0>Saint Augustine<b6_0/><a2_0/>, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted vein \u2013 as a comic rationale for an old man's meddling \u2013 but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by <a3_0><b7_0>Seneca<b7_0/><a3_0/>.
