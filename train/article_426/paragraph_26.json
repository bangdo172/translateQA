Early 20th century critics such as <a0_0><b4_0>Ezra Pound<b4_0/><a0_0/>, T. E. Hulme, and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be <a1_0><b5_0>sentimental<b5_0/><a1_0/> \"slop\" (Hulme)[citation needed] or \"an old bitch gone in the teeth\" (Pound) and wanted to go back to a more manly, authoritarian society such as (they believed) existed in the Middle Ages. Postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists, such as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard and Michel Foucault, have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature, which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. \"Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal\", suggests <a2_0><b6_0>Timothy Laurie<b6_0/><a2_0/>, turning the human into what he calls \"a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)\". Nevertheless, philosopher <a3_0><b7_0>Kate Soper<b7_0/><a3_0/> notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently \"secretes a humanist rhetoric\"."}
