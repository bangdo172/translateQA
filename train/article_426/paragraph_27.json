Critics of antihumanism, most notably J\u00fcrgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight <b6_0>humanism<b6_0/>'s failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves <b8_0>humanists<b8_0/> on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \"race\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the <a1_0><b5_0>20th century<b5_0/><a1_0/> \"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\". For \"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\". Yet, he continues, \"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing <a2_0>humanism<a2_0/> remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\""}
