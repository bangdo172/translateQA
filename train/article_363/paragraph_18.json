Pits are much closer to <b5_0>the label side of a disc<b5_0/>, enabling defects and contaminants on <b8_0>the clear side<b8_0/> to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the <a0_0>label side of the disc<a0_0/>. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by <a1_0><b6_0>refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing<b6_0/><a1_0/>. The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to corrode the metal reflective layer and to interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits.
