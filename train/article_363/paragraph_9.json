Small granules of heated <a1_0><b8_0>raw polycarbonate plastic<b8_0/><a1_0/> are fed into the press. A screw forces the liquefied plastic into the mold cavity. The mold closes with a metal stamper in contact with the disc surface. The plastic is allowed to cool and harden. Once opened, the disc substrate is removed from the mold by <b9_0>a robotic arm<b9_0/>, and a <a2_0><b5_0>15 mm<a2_0/> diameter<b5_0/> center hole (called <b7_0>a <a4_0>stacking ring<b7_0/><a4_0/>) is created.
