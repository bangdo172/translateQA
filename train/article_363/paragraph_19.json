Standard CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is <a1_0>120 millimetres (4.7 in)<a1_0/> in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700 MiB (737,280,000-byte) data capacity. This capacity was reportedly specified by Sony executive <a4_0><b5_0>Norio Ohga<b5_0/><a4_0/> in May 1980 so as to be able to contain the entirety of the London Philharmonic Orchestra's recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on one disc. This is a myth according to Kees Immink, as the code format had not yet been decided in <b9_0>May <b7_0>1980<b9_0/><b7_0/>. The adoption of EFM one month later would have allowed a playing time of <b6_0>97 minutes<b6_0/> for 120 mm diameter or 74 minutes for a disc as small as 100 mm. The 120 mm diameter has been adopted by subsequent formats, including Super Audio CD, DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc. <a2_0>Eighty-millimeter<a2_0/> discs (\"Mini CDs\") were originally designed for CD singles and can hold up to 24 minutes of music or 210 MiB of data but never became popular.[citation needed] Today, nearly every single is released on a <a3_0>120 mm<a3_0/> CD, called a Maxi single.[citation needed]"}
