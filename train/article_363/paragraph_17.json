Instead, <a0_0>non-return-to-zero<a0_0/>, inverted encoding is used: a <a2_0>change from pit to land or land to pit<a2_0/> indicates a <b8_0>one<b8_0/>, while no change indicates a series of zeros. There must be <b4_0>at least two and no more than ten<b4_0/> zeros between each one, which is defined by the length of the pit. This in turn is decoded by reversing the <a3_0><b6_0>eight-to-fourteen<a3_0/> modulation<b6_0/> used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the cross-interleaved <b7_0>Reed\u2013Solomon<b7_0/> coding, finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in <b5_0>the <a1_0>Red Book<b5_0/><a1_0/>) were originally designed for CD Digital Audio, but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as CD-ROM)."}
