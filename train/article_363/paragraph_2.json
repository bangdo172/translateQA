In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After <a1_0>a year<a1_0/> of experimentation and discussion, the Red Book CD-DA standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in <a6_0>1982<a6_0/>, compact discs and their players were extremely popular.

The success of the compact disc has been credited to the <a5_0>cooperation between Philips and Sony<a5_0/>, who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware.
