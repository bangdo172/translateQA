From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In <a2_0><b4_0>1983<b4_0/><a2_0/>, following the CD's introduction, <b8_0>Immink and Braat<b8_0/> presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention. In June 1985, the computer-readable CD-ROM (<a0_0>read-only memory<a0_0/>) and, in <a1_0><b6_0>1990<b6_0/><a1_0/>, CD-Recordable were introduced, also developed by <b7_0>both Sony and Philips<b7_0/>. Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without <b5_0>defects introduced in compression<b5_0/> used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio CD."}
