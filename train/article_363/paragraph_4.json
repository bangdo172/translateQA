His team developed a digital PCM adaptor audio tape recorder using a <a4_0>Betamax video recorder<a4_0/> in 1973.

A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30 cm disc that could play <b9_0>60 minutes<b9_0/> of digital audio (44,100 Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using MFM modulation. In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, <b10_0>44,056 Hz<b10_0/> sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and cross-interleaved error correction code\u2014specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard Compact Disc format in 1980.
