For example, an <a1_0><b8_0>antibiotic target<b8_0/><a1_0/> may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a <a4_0>mutation<a4_0/> in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through <a2_0><a5_0><b9_0>vertical transmission<b9_0/><a2_0/> of mutations<a5_0/> during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, <a3_0><b10_0>antibacterial resistance genes<b10_0/><a3_0/> can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that <a6_0><b11_0>carry several different resistance genes<b11_0/><a6_0/> can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound."}
