Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described <a1_0><b6_0>over 2000 years ago<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected <a2_0><b7_0>mold and plant materials and extracts<b7_0/><a2_0/> to treat infections. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, \"if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics\". The term 'antibiosis', meaning \"<a3_0>against life<a3_0/>\", was introduced by the French bacteriologist <a4_0>Jean Paul Vuillemin<a4_0/> as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis. These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by <b9_0>Selman Waksman<b9_0/>, an American microbiologist, in 1942. Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with <b8_0>Paul Ehrlich<b8_0/> in the late 1880s. Ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, in 1907, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the synthetic antibacterial salvarsan now called arsphenamine."}
