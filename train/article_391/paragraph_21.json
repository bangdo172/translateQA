Later, <a2_0><b7_0>Norman Heatley<b7_0/><a2_0/> developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by <a4_0><b9_0>Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin<b9_0/><a4_0/> in <a3_0><b8_0>1945<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety. For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Ernst Chain and Howard Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming. Florey credited Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin."}
