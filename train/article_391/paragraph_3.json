Moreover, research have shown that mice given low-dose penicillin (1 \u03bcg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the weaning process had an increased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and increased hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, compared to controlled mice.

Studies have found a correlation between early exposure of antibiotics (<6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months).
