For example, emergent bacterial strains causing <a1_0>tuberculosis<a1_0/> (TB) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly <a2_0><b6_0>half a million<b6_0/><a2_0/> new cases of multidrug-resistant <b5_0>tuberculosis<b5_0/> (<a3_0><b7_0>MDR-TB<b7_0/><a3_0/>) are estimated to occur worldwide. For example, <b8_0>NDM-1<b8_0/> is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials. The United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency has stated that \"most isolates with NDM-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections.\""}
