In the north <a0_0>the Turks<a0_0/> captured the border fort of Saint Nicholas in a surprise night attack (27/28 October). They then pushed about <a1_0>20000 troops<a1_0/> across the Cholok River border. Being outnumbered the Russians abandoned Poti and Redut Kale and drew back to <a2_0>Marani<a2_0/>. Both sides remained immobile for the next seven months. 2. In the center the Turks moved north from Ardahan to within cannon-shot of Akhaltsike and awaited <a4_0>reinforcements<a4_0/> (13 November). The Russians routed them. The claimed losses were 4000 Turks and 400 Russians. 3. In the south about <a3_0>30000<a3_0/> Turks slowly moved east to the main Russian concentration at Gyumri or Alexandropol (November). They crossed the border and set up artillery south of town. Prince Orbeliani tried to drive them off and found himself trapped. The Turks failed to press their advantage, the remaining Russians rescued Orbeliani and the Turks retired west. Orbeliani lost about 1000 men out of 5000. The Russians now decided to advance, the Turks took up a strong position on the Kars road and attacked. They were defeated in the battle of Ba\u015fgedikler, losing 6000 men, half their artillery and all their supply train. The Russians lost 1300, including Prince Orbeliani. This was Prince Ellico Orbeliani whose wife was later kidnaped by Shamyl at Tsinandali. 4. At sea the Turks sent a fleet east which was destroyed by Admiral Nakhimov at Sinope."}
