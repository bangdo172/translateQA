The goal was <a1_0>to promote year-round trade and a year-round navy<a1_0/>.:11 Pursuit of this goal brought the emerging Russian state into conflict with the <a2_0>Ukrainian Cossacks<a2_0/> and then with the Tatars of the Crimean Khanate and Circassians. When Russia conquered these groups and gained possession of southern Ukraine, known as <a4_0>New Russia<a4_0/> during Russian imperial times, the Ottoman Empire lost its buffer zone against Russian expansion, and Russia and the Ottoman Empire fell into direct conflict. The conflict with the Ottoman Empire also presented a religious issue of importance, as Russia saw itself as the protector of <a3_0>Orthodox Christians<a3_0/>, many of whom lived under Ottoman control and were treated as second-class citizens.(ch 1)"}
