When they relented in August most of the campaigning season was lost. In September <a1_0>8000<a1_0/> Turks landed at Batum, but the main concentration was at <a2_0>Sukhum Kale<a2_0/>. This required a 100-mile march south through a country with poor roads. The Russians planned to hold the line of <a3_0>the Ingur River<a3_0/> which separates Abkhazia from Georgia proper. Omar crossed the Ingur on 7 November and then wasted a great deal of time, the Russians doing little. By 2 December he had reached <a4_0>the Tskhenis-dzqali<a4_0/>, the rainy season had started, his camps were submerged in mud and there was no bread. Learning of the fall of Kars he withdrew to the Ingur. The Russians did nothing and he evacuated to Batum in February of the following year."}
