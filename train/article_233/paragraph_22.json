Simultaneously, in the east, the Ottomans crossed the Danube at Silistra and attacked the Russians at <a3_0>Olteni\u021ba<a3_0/>. The resulting Battle of Olteni\u021ba was the first engagement following the declaration of war. The Russians counterattacked, but were beaten back. On 31 December 1853, the Ottoman forces at Calafat moved against the Russian force at <a4_0>Chetatea or Cetate<a4_0/>, a small village nine miles north of Calafat, and engaged them on 6 January 1854. The battle began when the Russians made a move to recapture Calafat. Most of the heavy fighting, however, took place in and around Chetatea until the Russians were driven out of the village. Despite the setback at Chetatea, on 28 January 1854, Russian forces laid siege to Calafat. The siege would continue until May 1854 when the Russians lifted the siege. The Ottomans would also later beat the Russians in battle at Caracal.:130\u201343"}
