After extended preparations, the forces landed on the peninsula in September <a1_0>1854<a1_0/> and fought their way to a point south of Sevastopol after a series of successful battles. The Russians counterattacked on 25 <a2_0>October<a2_0/> in what became the Battle of Balaclava and were repulsed, but at the cost of seriously depleting the British Army forces.
