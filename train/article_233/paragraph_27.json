The Russian fleet during this time declined to engage the allies, preferring to maintain a \"fleet in being\"; this strategy failed when <a0_0>Sevastopol<a0_0/>, the main port and where most of the Black Sea fleet was based, came under siege. The Russians were reduced to scuttling their warships as <a1_0>blockships<a1_0/>, after stripping them of their guns and men <a2_0>to reinforce batteries on shore<a2_0/>. During the siege, the Russians lost four 110- or 120-gun, three-decker ships of the line, <a4_0>twelve<a4_0/> 84-gun two-deckers and <a3_0>four<a3_0/> 60-gun frigates in the Black Sea, plus a large number of smaller vessels. During the rest of the campaign the allied fleets remained in control of the Black Sea, ensuring the various fronts were kept supplied."}
