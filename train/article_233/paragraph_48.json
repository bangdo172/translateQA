Perhaps the most influential contributor to the development of naval mining was a Swede resident in Russia, the inventor and civil engineer <a1_0>Immanuel Nobel<a1_0/> (the father of <a4_0>Alfred Nobel<a4_0/>). Immanuel Nobel helped the Russian war effort by applying his knowledge of <a2_0>industrial explosives<a2_0/>, such as nitroglycerin and gunpowder. One account dates modern naval mining from the Crimean War: \"Torpedo mines, if I may use this name given by <a3_0>Fulton<a3_0/> to self-acting mines underwater, were among the novelties attempted by the Russians in their defences about Cronstadt and Sevastopol\", as one American officer put it in 1860."}
