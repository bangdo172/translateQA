The ITU prefix <b4_0>VO<b4_0/> was assigned to the Dominion of Newfoundland before the province joined Canadian Confederation in <a2_0>1949<a2_0/>, and three AM stations kept their existing call letters. However, other commercial radio stations in St. John's which went to air after 1949 use the same range of prefixes (CF\u2013CK) currently in use elsewhere in Canada, with the exception of VOCM-FM, which was permitted to adopt the VOCM callsign because of its corporate association with the AM station that already bore that callsign. VO also remains in use in amateur radio."}
