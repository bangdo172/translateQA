The inhabitants were able to fend off a second Dutch attack in <a1_0>1673<a1_0/>, when this time it was defended by <b6_0>Christopher Martin<b6_0/>, an English merchant captain. Martin landed six cannons from his vessel, the Elias Andrews, and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour. With only <a2_0><b7_0>twenty-three<b7_0/><a2_0/> men, the valiant Martin beat off an attack by <a4_0>three<a4_0/> Dutch warships. The English government planned to expand these fortifications (Fort William) in around <b8_0>1689<b8_0/>, but actual construction didn't begin until after the <b9_0>French admiral <a3_0>Pierre Le Moyne<a3_0/> d'Iberville<b9_0/> captured and destroyed the town in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign (1696). When 1500 English reinforcements arrived in late 1697 they found nothing but rubble where the town and fortifications had stood."}
