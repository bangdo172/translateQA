Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men, women, or both, although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations. An individual homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine, feminine, or androgynous, and in addition, many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the <a7_0>\"<a3_0>gender-conforming heterosexual\" and the \"gender-nonconforming homosexual<a3_0/>\"<a7_0/> as negative stereotypes. Nevertheless, studies by J. <a8_0>Michael Bailey and Kenneth Zucker<a8_0/> found a majority of the gay men and lesbians sampled reporting various degrees of <a4_0>gender-nonconformity<a4_0/> <a9_0>during their childhood years."}
