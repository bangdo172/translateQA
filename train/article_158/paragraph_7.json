Knowing how much of the population is made up of homosexual individuals <a3_0>influences <a4_0>how this population may be seen or treated by the public and government bodies<a4_0/><a3_0/>. For example, if homosexual individuals constitute only 1% of the general population they are politically easier to ignore or than if they are known to be a constituency that surpasses most ethnic and ad minority groups. If the number is relatively minor then it is difficult to argue for community based same sex programs and services, mass media inclusion of gay role models, or Gay/Straight Alliances in schools. For this reason, in the 1970s <a5_0>Bruce Voeller<a5_0/>, the chair of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force perpetuated a common myth <a0_0><a6_0>that the prevalence of homosexuality is 10% for the whole population<a0_0/> by <a1_0>averaging a 13% number for men and a 7% number for women<a6_0/><a1_0/>. Voeller generalized this finding and <a7_0>used it as part of the modern gay rights movement to convince politicians and the public that \"<a2_0>we [gays and lesbians] are everywhere<a2_0/>\"."}
