Thus, the fact that women are aroused by seeing non-human primates having sex does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest. Some researchers argue that women's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men's and that other components of sexual orientation (like <a4_0>emotional attachment<a4_0/>) must be taken into account when describing women's sexual orientations. In contrast, men's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the <a3_0>physical component of attractions<a3_0/> and, thus, their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to sex."}
