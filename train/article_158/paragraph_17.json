For example, if homosexual is defined by same sex behavior, gay virgins are omitted, heterosexuals engaging in same sex behavior for other reasons than preferred sexual arousal are miscounted, and those with same sex attraction who only have opposite-sex relations are excluded. <a3_0>Because of the limited populations that each component captures<a3_0/>, consumers of research <a4_0>should be cautious in generalizing these findings."}
