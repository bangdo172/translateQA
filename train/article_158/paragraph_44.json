However, research suggests that <a2_0>this may be of immunological origin, caused by a maternal immune reaction against a substance crucial to male fetal development during pregnancy,<a2_0/> which becomes increasingly likely after every male gestation. As a result of this immune effect, alterations in later-born males' prenatal development have been thought to occur. This process, known as the <a3_0>maternal immunization hypothesis<a3_0/> (MIH), would begin when cells from a male fetus enter the mother's circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth. These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother's immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment. From here, the anti-male bodies would then cross the <a4_0>blood/brain barrier<a4_0/> (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, causing the exposed son to be more attracted to men over women."}
