Psychiatrist Anil Aggrawal explains that androphilia, along with gynephilia, \"is needed to overcome immense difficulties in characterizing the sexual orientation of trans men and trans women. For instance, it is difficult to decide whether a trans man erotically attracted to males is a heterosexual female or a homosexual male; or a trans woman erotically attracted to females is a heterosexual male or a lesbian female. Any attempt to classify them may not only cause <a2_0>confusion<a2_0/> but arouse offense among <a1_0>the affected s<a1_0/>ubjects. In such cases, while defining sexual attraction, it is best to focus on the object of their attraction rather than on the sex or gender of the subject.\" Sexologist Milton Diamond writes, \"The terms heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual <a3_0>are better used as adjectives, not nouns, and are better applied to behaviors, not people.<a3_0/> This usage is particularly advantageous <a4_0>when discussing the partners of transsexual or intersexed individuals<a4_0/>. These newer terms also do not carry the social weight of the former ones.\""}
