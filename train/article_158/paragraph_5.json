Research in the 1970s on masculinity and femininity found that concepts of masculinity and femininity are <a5_0>more appropriately measured <a1_0>as independent concepts on a separate scale<a1_0/> rather than as a single continuum<a5_0/>, with each end representing opposite extremes. When compared on the same scale, <a2_0>they act as tradeoffs such, whereby to be more feminine one had to be less masculine and vice versa<a2_0/>. However, if they are considered as separate dimensions one can be simultaneously very masculine and very feminine. Similarly, considering heterosexuality and homosexuality on separate scales <a6_0>would allow one to be both very heterosexual and very homosexual or not very much of either.<a6_0/> When they are measured independently, <a3_0><a7_0>the degree of heterosexual and homosexual can be independently determined,<a7_0/> rather than the balance between heterosexual and homosexual<a3_0/> as determined using the Kinsey Scale."}
