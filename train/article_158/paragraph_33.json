(1993) and Weinberg et al. (1994) criticized the scale for <a0_0>lumping individuals who are different based on different dimensions of sexuality into the same categories.<a0_0/> When applying the scale, Kinsey considered two dimensions of sexual orientation: overt sexual experience and psychosexual reactions. Valuable information was lost by <a1_0>collapsing the two values into one final score<a1_0/>. <a2_0>A person who has only predominantly same sex reactions is different from someone with relatively little reaction but lots of same sex experience<a2_0/>. It would have been quite simple for Kinsey <a3_0>to have measured the two dimensions separately and report scores independently to avoid loss of information<a3_0/>. Furthermore, there are more than two dimensions of sexuality to be considered. Beyond behavior and reactions, <a4_0>one could also assess attraction, identification, lifestyle<a4_0/> etc. This is addressed by the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid."}
