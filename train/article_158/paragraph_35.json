Laumann et al., (1994) found that among U.S. adults 20% of those who would be considered homosexual on one component of orientation were homosexual on the other two dimensions and 70% responded in a way that was consistent with homosexuality on only one of the three dimensions. Furthermore, sexuality is fluid <a1_0>such that one's sexual orientation is not necessarily stable or consistent over time but is subject to change throughout life.<a1_0/> Diamond (2003) found that <a2_0>over 7 years 2/3 of the women changed their sexual identity at least once,<a2_0/> with many reporting that the label was not adequate in capturing the diversity of their sexual or romantic feelings. Furthermore, women who relinquished bisexual and lesbian identification did not relinquish same sex sexuality and acknowledged <a3_0>the possibility for future same sex attractions and/or behaviour<a3_0/>. One woman stated \"I'm mainly straight but I'm one of those people who, if the right circumstance came along, would change my viewpoint\". Therefore, <a4_0>individuals classified as homosexual in one study might not be identified the same way in another depending on which components are assessed<a4_0/> and when the assessment is made making it difficult to pin point who is homosexual and who is not and what the overall prevalence within a population may be."}
