Does It Matter?\", <a0_0>Ritch Savin-Williams<a0_0/> proposes two different approaches to assessing sexual orientation until well positioned and psychometrically sound and tested definitions are developed that would allow research to reliably identify the prevalence, causes, and consequences of homosexuality. He first <a1_0>suggests that greater priority should be given to sexual arousal and attraction<a1_0/> over behaviour and identity because it is less prone to self- and other-deception, social conditions and variable meanings. To measure attraction and arousal he proposed <a2_0>that biological measures should be developed and used.<a2_0/> There are numerous biological/physiological measures that exist that can measure sexual orientation such as sexual arousal, brain scans, eye tracking, body odour preference, and anatomical variations such as digit-length ratio and right or left handedness. Secondly, Savin-Williams suggests that <a3_0>researchers should forsake the general notion of sexual orientation altogether<a3_0/> and <a4_0>assess only those components that are relevant for the research question being investigated<a4_0/>.
