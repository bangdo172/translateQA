For example, people may use other labels, such as <a0_0>pansexual or polysexual,<a0_0/> or none at all. According to the American Psychological Association, sexual orientation \"also refers to <a1_0>a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions<a1_0/>\". <a2_0>Androphilia and gynephilia<a2_0/> are terms used in behavioral science to describe sexual orientation as an alternative to a gender binary conceptualization. Androphilia describes <a3_0>sexual attraction to masculinity<a3_0/>; gynephilia describes <a4_0>the sexual attraction to femininity<a4_0/>. The term sexual preference largely overlaps with sexual orientation, but is generally distinguished in psychological research. A person who identifies as bisexual, for example, may sexually prefer one sex over the other. Sexual preference may also suggest a degree of voluntary choice, whereas the scientific consensus is that sexual orientation is not a choice."}
