The CBS Associated label was renamed <b6_0>Epic Associated<b6_0/>. Also on January 1, 1991, to replace the CBS label, Sony reintroduced the Columbia label worldwide, which it previously held in the United States and Canada only, after it acquired the international rights to the trademark from EMI in 1990. <a2_0>Japan<a2_0/> is the only country where Sony does not have rights <b7_0>to the Columbia name as it is controlled by <a3_0>Nippon Columbia<b7_0/><a3_0/>, an unrelated company.
