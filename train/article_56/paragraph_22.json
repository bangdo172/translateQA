Due to its situation along the North Atlantic, the city often receives sea breezes, especially in the <a2_0>late spring<a2_0/>, when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than 20 \u00b0F (11 \u00b0C) colder than a few miles inland, sometimes dropping by that amount near midday. Thunderstorms occur from <a3_0>May to September<a3_0/>, that are occasionally severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours. Although downtown Boston has never been struck by a violent tornado, the city itself has experienced many tornado warnings. Damaging storms are more common to areas north, west, and northwest of the city. Boston has a relatively sunny climate for a coastal city at its latitude, averaging over <a4_0>2,600<a4_0/> hours of sunshine per annum."}
