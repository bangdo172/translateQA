The largest reclamation efforts took place during the 19th century; beginning in 1807, <a0_0>the crown of Beacon Hill<a0_0/> was used to fill in a 50-acre (20 ha) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square area. The present-day <a1_0>State House<a1_0/> sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the South End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown. After <a2_0>The Great Boston Fire of 1872<a2_0/>, workers used building rubble <a3_0>as landfill along the downtown waterfront<a3_0/>. During the mid-to-late 19th century, workers filled almost 600 acres (2.4 km2) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of Boston Common with gravel brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights. The city annexed the adjacent towns of South Boston (1804), East Boston (1836), Roxbury (1868), Dorchester (including present day Mattapan and a portion of South Boston) (1870), Brighton (including present day Allston) (1874), West Roxbury (including present day Jamaica Plain and Roslindale) (1874), Charlestown (1874), and Hyde Park (1912). Other proposals, for the annexation of Brookline, Cambridge, and Chelsea, were unsuccessful."}
