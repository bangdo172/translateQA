The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch <a1_0><b5_0>channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle<b5_0/><a1_0/>. This enabled architects to raise <a2_0><b6_0>vaults<b6_0/><a2_0/> much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture. While, structurally, use of the pointed arch gave a greater flexibility to architectural form, it also gave Gothic architecture a very different and <a3_0><b7_0>more vertical visual character<b7_0/><a3_0/> than Romanesque."}
