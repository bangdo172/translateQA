Each English cathedral (with the exception of Salisbury) has an extraordinary degree of stylistic diversity, when compared with most French, German and Italian cathedrals. It is not unusual for every part of the building to have been built in a different century and in a different style, with no attempt at creating a stylistic unity. Unlike French cathedrals, English cathedrals sprawl across their sites, with <a1_0><b6_0>double transepts<b6_0/><a1_0/> projecting strongly and Lady Chapels tacked on at a later date, such as at Westminster Abbey. In the west front, the doors are not as significant as in France, the usual congregational entrance being through a side porch. The West window is <a2_0><b7_0>very large<b7_0/><a2_0/> and never a rose, which are reserved for <a3_0><b8_0>the transept gables<b8_0/><a3_0/>. The west front may have two towers like a French Cathedral, or none. There is nearly always a tower <a4_0><b9_0>at the crossing<b9_0/><a4_0/> and it may be very large and surmounted by a spire. The distinctive English east end is square, but it may take a completely different form. Both internally and externally, the stonework is often richly decorated with carvings, particularly the capitals."}
