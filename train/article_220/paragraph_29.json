This is expressed in the Gothic architecture of Central Europe in the huge size of the towers and spires, often projected, but not always completed. The west front generally follows <a1_0><b5_0>the French formula<b5_0/><a1_0/>, but the towers are very much taller and, if complete, are surmounted by enormous openwork spires that are a regional feature. Because of the size of the towers, the section of the fa\u00e7ade between them may appear narrow and compressed. The eastern end <a2_0>follows <b6_0>the French form<b6_0/><a2_0/>. The distinctive character of the interior of German Gothic cathedrals is <a3_0><b7_0>their breadth and openness<b7_0/><a3_0/>. This is the case even when, as at Cologne, they have been modelled upon a French cathedral. German cathedrals, like the French, tend not to have strongly projecting transepts. There are also many hall churches (<a4_0><b8_0>Hallenkirchen<b8_0/><a4_0/>) without clerestory windows."}
