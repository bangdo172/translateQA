Wells Cathedral in England, commenced at the eastern end <a1_0><b6_0>in 1175<b6_0/><a1_0/>, was the first building in which the designer broke free from Romanesque forms. The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by <a2_0><b7_0>Adam Locke<b7_0/><a2_0/> in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic. <a3_0><b8_0>Wells Cathedral<b8_0/><a3_0/> is thus considered the first truly Gothic cathedral."}
