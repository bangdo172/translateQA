The technological change permitted a stylistic change which broke the tradition of massive masonry and solid walls penetrated by small openings, replacing it with a style where light appears to triumph over substance. With its use came the development of many other architectural devices, previously put to the test in scattered buildings and then called into service to meet the structural, aesthetic and ideological needs of the new style. These include <a1_0><b6_0>the flying buttresses<b6_0/><a1_0/>, pinnacles and <a2_0><b9_0>traceried windows<b9_0/><a2_0/> which typify Gothic ecclesiastical architecture. But while pointed arch is so strongly associated with the Gothic style, it was first used in Western architecture in buildings that were in other ways clearly Romanesque, notably <a3_0><b7_0>Durham Cathedral<b7_0/><a3_0/> in the north of England, Monreale Cathedral and <a4_0><b8_0>Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9<b8_0/><a4_0/> in Sicily, Autun Cathedral in France."}
