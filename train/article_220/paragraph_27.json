They are compact, with slight or no projection of the transepts and subsidiary chapels. The west fronts are highly consistent, having <a1_0><b6_0>three<b6_0/> portals<a1_0/> surmounted by a rose window, and <a2_0>two large towers<a2_0/>. Sometimes there are additional towers on the transept ends. <a3_0>The east end is <b8_0>polygonal<b8_0/><a3_0/> with ambulatory and sometimes a chevette of radiating chapels.
