The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the <b8_0>Gothic<b8_0/> style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The <a2_0><b7_0>proximity of some regions<b7_0/><a2_0/> meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as England and <a4_0><b9_0>Spain<b9_0/><a4_0/> produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in <a3_0>the Gothic<a3_0/>."}
