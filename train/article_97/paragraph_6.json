Even the \"highly observant\" <a3_0>Gilbert White<a3_0/>, in his posthumously published 1789 The Natural History of Selborne, quoted a man's story about swallows being found in a chalk cliff collapse \"while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone\", though the man denied being an eyewitness. However, he also writes that \"as to swallows being found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of this country, I never heard any such account worth attending to\", and that if early swallows \"happen to find frost and snow they immediately withdraw for a time\u2014a circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration\", since he doubts they would \"return for a week or two to warmer latitudes\"."}
