The storage of energy <a2_0>through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep<a2_0/> in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the <a3_0>feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear<a3_0/> and require to be molted. The timing of this molt - <a1_0>usually once a year<a1_0/> but sometimes twice - <a4_0>varies with some species<a4_0/> molting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation."}
