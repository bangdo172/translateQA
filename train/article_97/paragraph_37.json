These changes are also related to hormonal changes in the birds. In the period before migration, many birds display <a1_0>higher activity<a1_0/> or Zugunruhe (German: <a2_0>migratory restlessness<a2_0/>), first described by Johann Friedrich Naumann in 1795, as well as physiological changes such as increased fat deposition. The occurrence of Zugunruhe even in cage-raised birds with no environmental cues (e.g. shortening of day and falling temperature) has pointed to the role of circannual endogenous programs in controlling bird migrations. Caged birds display a <a3_0>preferential flight direction<a3_0/> that corresponds with the migratory direction they would take in nature, changing their preferential direction at roughly <a4_0>the same time their wild conspecifics change course<a4_0/>."}
