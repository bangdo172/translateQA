While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under <a2_0>genetic control<a2_0/>, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the <a3_0>genetic framework for migratory behavior<a3_0/> exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum."}
