Partial migration is very common in <a1_0>the southern continents<a1_0/>; in Australia, <a2_0>44%<a2_0/> of non-passerine birds and <a3_0>32%<a3_0/> of passerine species are partially migratory. In some species, the population at higher latitudes tends to be migratory and will often winter at lower latitude. The migrating birds bypass the latitudes where other populations may be sedentary, where suitable wintering habitats may already be occupied. This is an example of leap-frog migration. Many fully migratory species show leap-frog migration (<a4_0>birds that nest at higher latitudes spend the winter at lower latitudes<a4_0/>), and many show the alternative, chain migration, where populations 'slide' more evenly north and south without reversing order."}
