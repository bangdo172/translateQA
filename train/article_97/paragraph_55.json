The populations of <a1_0>Siberian cranes<a1_0/> (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) that wintered in India declined due to hunting along the route, particularly in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Birds were last seen in their favourite wintering grounds in Keoladeo National Park in <a2_0>2002<a2_0/>. Structures such as power lines, wind farms and offshore oil-rigs have also been known to affect <a3_0>migratory birds<a3_0/>. Other migration hazards include <a4_0>pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction<a4_0/> along migration routes, denying migrants food at stopover points. For example, in the East Asian\u2013Australasian Flyway, up to 65% of key intertidal habitat at the Yellow Sea migration bottleneck has been destroyed since the 1950s."}
