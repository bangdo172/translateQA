Species that move short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, instead moving in <a1_0>response to local weather conditions<a1_0/>. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as wallcreeper Tichodroma muraria and white-throated dipper Cinclus cinclus, may move only altitudinally <a2_0>to escape the cold higher ground<a2_0/>. Other species such as merlin Falco columbarius and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis move further, to <a3_0>the coast or towards the south<a3_0/>.
