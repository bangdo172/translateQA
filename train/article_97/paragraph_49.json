However some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and are far from optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of <a2_0>Swainson's thrush<a2_0/> Catharus ustulatus, which fly <a3_0>far east across North America<a3_0/> before turning south via Florida to reach northern South America; this route is believed to be the consequence of a range expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Detours may also be caused by differential wind conditions, predation risk, or other factors."}
