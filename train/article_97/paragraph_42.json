A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth's magnetic field, but does not know how far the journey will be. It does this through a radical pair mechanism whereby chemical reactions in special photo pigments sensitive to long wavelengths are affected by the field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of <a3_0>a boy scout with a compass but no map<a3_0/>, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this \"mapping\" is done by magnetites in the trigeminal system, which tell the bird how strong the field is. Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the magnetic field strengths at different latitudes let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and <a4_0>let it know when it has reached its destination<a4_0/>. There is a neural connection <a1_0>between the eye and \"Cluster N\"<a1_0/>, <a2_0>the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation<a2_0/>, suggesting that birds may actually be able to see the magnetic field of the earth."}
