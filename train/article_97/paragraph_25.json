Some, such as the black guillemot Cepphus grylle and some gulls, are quite sedentary; others, such as most terns and auks breeding in the temperate northern hemisphere, move varying distances south in the northern winter. <a0_0><a1_0>The Arctic tern<a1_0/><a0_0/> Sterna paradisaea has the longest-distance migration of any bird, and sees more daylight than any other, moving from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic non-breeding areas. One Arctic tern, ringed (banded) as a chick on the Farne Islands off the British east coast, reached Melbourne, Australia in just <a2_0>three months<a2_0/> from fledging, a sea journey of over <a3_0>22,000 km<a3_0/> (14,000 mi).
