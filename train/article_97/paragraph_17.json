An expedition to Mt. Everest found <a0_0>skeletons<a0_0/> of northern pintail Anas acuta and black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa at 5,000 m (16,000 ft) on the Khumbu Glacier. <a1_0>Bar-headed geese Anser indicus<a1_0/> have been recorded by GPS flying at up to 6,540 metres (21,460 ft) while crossing the Himalayas, at the same time engaging in the highest rates of climb to altitude for any bird. Anecdotal reports of them flying much higher have yet to be corroborated with any direct evidence. <a2_0>Seabirds<a2_0/> fly low over water but gain altitude when crossing land, and the reverse pattern is seen in landbirds. However most bird migration is in the range of <a3_0>150 to 600 m<a3_0/> (490 to 1,970 ft). Bird strike aviation records from the United States show most collisions occur <a4_0>below 600 m<a4_0/> (2,000 ft) and almost none above 1,800 m (5,900 ft)."}
