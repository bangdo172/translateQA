Often, this front narrows into one or more preferred routes termed <a4_0>flyways<a4_0/>. These routes typically follow <a1_0>mountain ranges or coastlines<a1_0/>, sometimes rivers, and may take advantage of updrafts and other wind patterns or avoid geographical barriers such as <a2_0>large stretches of open water<a2_0/>. The specific routes may be genetically programmed or learned to varying degrees. The routes taken on forward and return migration are often different. A common pattern in North America is <a3_0>clockwise<a3_0/> migration, where birds flying North tend to be further West, and flying South tend to shift Eastwards."}
