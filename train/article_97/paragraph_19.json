However, many Holarctic wildfowl and finch (Fringillidae) species winter in the North Temperate Zone, in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus migrates <a0_0>from Iceland to Britain<a0_0/> and neighbouring countries, whilst the dark-eyed junco Junco hyemalis migrates from subarctic and <a1_0>arctic climates to the contiguous United States<a1_0/> and the American goldfinch from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward to Western Oregon. Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young <a4_0>during their first migration with their parents<a4_0/>. Some ducks, such as the garganey Anas querquedula, move completely or partially into the tropics. The European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca also follows this migratory trend, breeding in <a2_0>Asia and Europe<a2_0/> and wintering in <a3_0>Africa<a3_0/>."}
