The <b7_0>Houses<b7_0/> developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the <b5_0>18<b5_0/>th and 19th centuries were mostly run by women known as <a1_0>\"dames\"<a1_0/>. They typically contain about <a3_0>fifty<a3_0/> boys. Although classes are organised on a School basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their House. Each House has a formal name, mainly used for post and people outside the Eton community. It is generally known by the boys by the initials or surname of the House Master, <a2_0>the teacher who lives in the house and manages the pupils in it<a2_0/>."}
