Following the investigation by the OFT, each school was required to pay around <a2_0><b5_0><b6_0><b8_0>\u00a370,000<b8_0/><b6_0/><b5_0/>, totalling around \u00a33.5 million<a2_0/>, significantly less than the maximum possible fine.

The incident raised concerns over whether the charitable status of independent schools such as Eton should be reconsidered, and perhaps revoked. However, <a0_0><b7_0>Jean Scott<b7_0/><a0_0/>, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, \"They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.\""}
