Wellington was at Eton from <a1_0><b3_0><b4_0><b7_0>1781<b7_0/> to <b6_0>1784<b6_0/><b4_0/><b3_0/><a1_0/> and was to send his sons there. According to Nevill (citing the historian Sir <b5_0>Edward Creasy<b5_0/>), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, \"There grows the stuff that won Waterloo\", a remark Nevill construes as a reference to \"<a2_0>the manly character induced by games and sport<a2_0/>\" amongst English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically. In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's \"C'est ici qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 gagn\u00e9 la bataille de Waterloo\" (\"It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won.\")"}
