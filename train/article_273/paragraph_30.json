The correct rendering of Unicode Indic text requires transforming the stored logical order characters into <b7_0>visual order<b7_0/> and the forming of ligatures (aka <a1_0>conjuncts<a1_0/>) out of components. Some <b4_0>local scholars<b4_0/> argued in favor of assignments of Unicode code points to these ligatures, going against the practice for other writing systems, though Unicode contains some Arabic and other ligatures for backward compatibility purposes only. Encoding of any new ligatures in Unicode will not happen, in part because the set of ligatures is font-dependent, and <b5_0>Unicode is an encoding independent of font variations<b5_0/>. The same kind of issue arose for Tibetan script[citation needed] (the <b6_0>Chinese National Standard<b6_0/> organization failed to achieve a similar change)."}
