Unicode encodes characters by <a1_0>associating an abstract character with <b5_0>a particular code point<b5_0/><a1_0/>. However, not all <b7_0>abstract characters<b7_0/> are encoded as a single Unicode character, and some abstract characters may be represented in Unicode by <a2_0>a sequence of two or more characters<a2_0/>. For example, a Latin small letter \"i\" with <b4_0>an <b3_0>ogonek<b3_0/>, <a0_0>a dot above<a0_0/>, and an acute accent<b4_0/>, which is required in Lithuanian, is represented by the character sequence U+012F, U+0307, U+0301. Unicode maintains a list of uniquely named character sequences for abstract characters that are not directly encoded in Unicode."}
