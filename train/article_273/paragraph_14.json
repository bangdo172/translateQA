The Unicode Standard allows that the <b4_0>BOM<b4_0/> \"can serve as signature for UTF-8 encoded text <b3_0>where the character set is unmarked<b3_0/>\". Some software developers have adopted it for other encodings, including UTF-8, in an attempt to distinguish UTF-8 from local 8-bit code pages. However <a0_0><b5_0>RFC 3629<b5_0/><a0_0/>, the UTF-8 standard, recommends that byte order marks be forbidden in protocols using <a1_0>UTF-8<a1_0/>, but discusses the cases where this may not be possible. In addition, <a2_0>the large restriction on <b7_0>possible patterns<a2_0/> in UTF-8<b7_0/> (for instance there cannot be any <b6_0>lone<b6_0/> bytes with the high bit set) means that it should be possible to distinguish UTF-8 from other character encodings without relying on the BOM."}
