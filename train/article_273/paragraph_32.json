For example, \u1e17 (precomposed e with macron and acute above) and e\u0304\u0301 (e followed by the combining macron above and combining acute above) should be rendered <a4_0>identically<a4_0/>, both appearing as an e with a macron and acute accent, but in practice, their appearance may vary depending upon what rendering engine and fonts are being used to display the characters. Similarly, <b6_0>underdots<b6_0/>, as needed in the <b9_0>romanization<b9_0/> of Indic, will <a2_0>often be placed incorrectly<a2_0/>[citation needed]. Unicode characters that map to precomposed glyphs can be used in many cases, thus avoiding the problem, but where no precomposed character has been encoded the problem can often be solved by using a specialist Unicode font such as <b7_0>Charis SIL<b7_0/> that uses <a1_0>Graphite, OpenType, or AAT technologies<a1_0/> for advanced rendering features."}
