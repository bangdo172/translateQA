This complication is due to Unicode inheriting the <a0_0><b4_0>Thai Industrial Standard 620<b4_0/><a0_0/>, which worked in the same way, and was the way in which Thai had always been written on <b6_0>keyboards<b6_0/>. This ordering problem complicates the Unicode collation process slightly, requiring table lookups to reorder Thai characters for collation. Even if Unicode had adopted encoding according to spoken order, it would still be problematic to collate words in dictionary order. E.g., the word \u0e41\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e07  [sa d\u025b\u02d0\u014b] \"perform\" starts with a consonant cluster \"\u0e2a\u0e14\" (with an inherent vowel for the consonant \"\u0e2a\"), the vowel \u0e41-, in spoken order would come after the \u0e14, but in a dictionary, the word is collated as it is written, with the vowel following the \u0e2a."}
