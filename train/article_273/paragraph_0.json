The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as <b9_0>Arabic<b9_0/> and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). As of June 2015[update], the most recent version is <a2_0>Unicode 8.0<a2_0/>. The standard is maintained by the <a3_0>Unicode Consortium<a3_0/>."}
