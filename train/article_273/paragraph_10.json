The latest version of the standard, Unicode 8.0, was released in <a1_0><b6_0>June<b6_0/> 2015<a1_0/> and is available from the consortium's website. The last of the major versions (versions x.0) to be published in book form was <a2_0>Unicode 5.0<a2_0/> (ISBN 0-321-48091-0), but since Unicode 6.0 the full text of the standard is no longer being published in book form. In <a3_0><b7_0>2012<b7_0/><a3_0/>, however, it was announced that only the core specification for Unicode version 6.1 would be made available as a <b8_0>692<b8_0/>-page print-on-demand paperback. Unlike the previous major version printings of the Standard, the print-on-demand core specification does not include <a4_0>any <b9_0>code charts or standard annexes<b9_0/><a4_0/>, but the entire standard, including the core specification, will still remain freely available on the Unicode website."}
