This is often due to the fact that Unicode encodes characters rather than <b3_0>glyphs<b3_0/> (<b4_0>the visual representations of the basic character that often vary from one language to another<b4_0/>). Unification of glyphs leads to the perception that <a2_0><b7_0>the languages themselves<b7_0/>, not just the basic character representation, are being merged<a2_0/>.[clarification needed] There have been several attempts to create <a1_0>alternative encodings that preserve the stylistic differences between <b6_0>Chinese, Japanese, and Korean<b6_0/> characters<a1_0/> in opposition to Unicode's policy of Han unification. An example of one is <b5_0>TRON<b5_0/> (although it is not widely adopted in Japan, there are some users who need to handle historical Japanese text and favor it)."}
