Although a great deal of text is still stored in legacy encodings, <a3_0>Unicode<a3_0/> is used almost exclusively for <b4_0>building new information processing systems<b4_0/>. Early adopters tended to use <a2_0><b8_0>UCS-2<b8_0/><a2_0/> (the fixed-width two-byte precursor to <b5_0>UTF-16<b5_0/>) and later moved to UTF-16 (the variable-width current standard), as this was the least disruptive way to add support for non-BMP characters. The best known such system is Windows NT (and its descendants, <b6_0>Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7<b6_0/>), which uses UTF-16 as the sole internal character encoding. The Java and .NET <b7_0>bytecode environments<b7_0/>, Mac OS X, and KDE also use it for internal representation. Unicode is available on Windows 95 through <a1_0>Microsoft Layer<a1_0/> for Unicode, as well as on its descendants, Windows 98 and Windows ME."}
