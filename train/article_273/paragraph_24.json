Instead, Unicode-based fonts typically focus on supporting only <a2_0><b4_0>basic ASCII and particular scripts or sets of characters or symbols<b4_0/><a2_0/>. Several reasons justify this approach: <b5_0>applications and documents<b5_0/> rarely need to render characters from more than one or two writing systems; fonts tend to demand resources in computing environments; and operating systems and applications show increasing intelligence in regard to obtaining glyph information from separate font files as needed, i.e., <b6_0>font substitution<b6_0/>. Furthermore, designing a consistent set of rendering instructions for tens of thousands of glyphs constitutes a monumental task; such a venture passes the point of diminishing returns for most typefaces."}
