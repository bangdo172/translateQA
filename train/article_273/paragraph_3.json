Many essentially identical characters were encoded multiple times at different code points <b7_0>to preserve distinctions used by legacy encodings<b7_0/> and therefore, allow conversion from those encodings to Unicode (and back) without losing any information. For example, the \"<b6_0>fullwidth forms<b6_0/>\" section of code points encompasses <a2_0>a full Latin alphabet that is separate from the main Latin alphabet<a2_0/> section because in <a3_0>Chinese, Japanese, and Korean<a3_0/> (<b5_0>CJK<b5_0/>) fonts, these Latin characters are rendered at the same width as CJK ideographs, rather than at half the width.
