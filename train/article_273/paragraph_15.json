In the other encodings, each code point may be represented by a variable number of code values. <b7_0>UTF-32<b7_0/> is widely used as an <a0_0>internal representation of text in programs<a0_0/> (as opposed to stored or transmitted text), since every Unix operating system that uses the <b6_0>gcc compilers<b6_0/> to generate software uses it as the standard \"wide character\" encoding. Some programming languages, such as <a1_0><b4_0>Seed7<b4_0/><a1_0/>, use UTF-32 as internal representation for strings and characters. Recent versions of the Python programming language (beginning with <a2_0><b5_0>2.2<b5_0/><a2_0/>) may also be configured to use UTF-32 as the representation for Unicode strings, effectively disseminating such encoding in high-level coded software."}
