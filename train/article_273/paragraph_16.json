This covers the use of combining <b4_0>diacritical marks<b4_0/>. They are inserted after the main character. Multiple combining diacritics may be stacked over <b5_0>the same character<b5_0/>. Unicode also contains precomposed versions of <a0_0>most letter/diacritic combinations<a0_0/> in normal use. These make conversion to and from legacy encodings simpler, and allow applications to use Unicode as an internal text format without having to implement <b6_0>combining characters<b6_0/>. For example, \u00e9 can be represented in Unicode as <a1_0><b8_0>U+0065<b8_0/><a1_0/> (LATIN SMALL LETTER E) followed by <a2_0>U+0301<a2_0/> (COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT), but it can also be represented as the precomposed character <a3_0>U+00E9<a3_0/> (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE). Thus, in many cases, users have multiple ways of encoding the same character. To deal with this, Unicode provides <b7_0>the mechanism of canonical equivalence<b7_0/>."}
