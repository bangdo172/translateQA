A simple solution to the placement of combining marks or diacritics is <a2_0>assigning the marks a width of <b6_0>zero<b6_0/> and placing the glyph itself to the left or right of the left sidebearing<a2_0/> (depending on the direction of the script they are intended to be used with). A mark handled this way will appear over whatever character precedes it, but will not adjust its position relative to the width or height of <b7_0>the base glyph<b7_0/>; it may be visually awkward and it may overlap some glyphs. <a1_0><b3_0>Real<b3_0/> stacking is impossible<a1_0/>, but can be approximated in limited cases (for example, Thai top-combining vowels and tone marks can just be at different heights to start with). Generally this approach is only effective in <b4_0>monospaced<b4_0/> fonts, but may be used as a fallback rendering method when more complex methods fail."}
