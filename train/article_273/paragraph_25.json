This was an attempt to provide a Unicode solution to encoding paragraphs and lines semantically, potentially replacing all of the various platform solutions. In doing so, Unicode does provide a way around the historical platform dependent solutions. Nonetheless, few if any Unicode solutions have adopted these Unicode line and paragraph separators as the sole canonical line ending characters. However, a common approach to solving this issue is through newline normalization. This is achieved with the <a2_0>Cocoa text system<a2_0/> in <b5_0>Mac OS X<b5_0/> and also with <b7_0>W3C XML<b7_0/> and HTML recommendations. In this approach <a3_0><b8_0>every possible newline character<b8_0/> is converted internally to a common newline<a3_0/> (which one does not really matter since <b6_0>it is an internal operation just for rendering<b6_0/>). In other words, the text system can correctly treat the character as a newline, regardless of the input's actual encoding."}
