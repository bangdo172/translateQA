The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors <a1_0>Rudolph Giuliani<a1_0/> in 1997 and <a2_0>Michael Bloomberg<a2_0/> in 2005. The anti-war <a3_0>Socialist<a3_0/> campaign of Morris Hillquit in the 1917 mayoral election won <a4_0>over 31%<a4_0/> of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor John P. Mitchel, who came in second (ahead of Hillquit) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit city-wide by 23.2% to 21.7%."}
