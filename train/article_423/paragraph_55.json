All of the characters in <a2_0>Herman Wouk<a2_0/>'s City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder (<a0_0>1948<a0_0/>) live in the Bronx, and <a1_0>about half<a1_0/> of the action is set there. Kate Simon's Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue. In <a4_0>Jacob M. Appel<a4_0/>'s short story, \"The Grand Concourse\" (<a3_0>2007<a3_0/>), a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in Avery Corman's book The Old Neighborhood (1980), an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood (Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people."}
