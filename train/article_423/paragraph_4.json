(<a0_0>The County of Bronx<a0_0/>, unlike the coextensive <a1_0>Borough of the Bronx<a1_0/>, does not place the immediately before Bronx in formal references, nor does the United States Postal Service in its database of Bronx addresses.) The name for this region, apparently after the Bronx River, first appeared in the Annexed District of the Bronx created in <a2_0>1874<a2_0/> out of part of <a3_0>Westchester<a3_0/> County and was continued in the Borough of the Bronx, which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in <a4_0>1898<a4_0/>. The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers. Another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family, as in visiting The Broncks, The Bronck's or The Broncks'."}
