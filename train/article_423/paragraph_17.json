Just south of Van Cortlandt Park is the Jerome Park Reservoir, surrounded by 2 miles (3 km) of stone walls and bordering several small parks in the Bedford Park neighborhood; the reservoir was built <a3_0>in the 1890s<a3_0/> on the site of the former Jerome Park Racetrack. Further south is Crotona Park, home to a <a2_0>3.3-acre<a2_0/> (1.3 ha) lake, <a1_0>28<a1_0/> species of trees, and a large swimming pool. The land for these parks, and many others, was bought by New York City in <a0_0>1888<a0_0/>, while land was still open and inexpensive, in anticipation of future needs and future pressures for development."}
