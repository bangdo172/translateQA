As hip hop's popularity grew, performers began speaking (\"rapping\") in sync with the beats, and became known as MCs or emcees. The Herculoids, made up of <a0_0>Herc, Coke La Rock, and DJ Clark Kent<a0_0/>, were the earliest to gain major fame. <a1_0>The Bronx<a1_0/> is referred to in hip-hop slang as \"The Boogie Down Bronx\", or just \"The Boogie Down\". This was hip-hop pioneer <a4_0>KRS-One<a4_0/>'s inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP, or Boogie Down Productions, which included DJ Scott La Rock. Newer hip hop artists from <a2_0>the Bronx<a2_0/> include Big Pun, Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz, Camp Lo, Swizz Beatz, Drag-On, Fat Joe, Terror Squad and Corey Gunz."}
