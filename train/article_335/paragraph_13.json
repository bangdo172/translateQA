Its sea-level elevation, coastal location, position just above the Tropic of Cancer, and proximity to the Gulf Stream shapes its climate. With January averaging 67.2 \u00b0F (<a2_0><b7_0>19.6<a2_0/> \u00b0C<b7_0/>), winter features mild to warm temperatures; cool air usually settles after the passage of a cold front, which produces much of the little amount of rainfall during the season. Lows occasionally fall below 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C), but very rarely below 35 \u00b0F (<a4_0><b9_0>2<a4_0/> \u00b0C<b9_0/>). Highs generally range between <a3_0><b8_0>70\u201377<a3_0/> \u00b0F<b8_0/> (21\u201325 \u00b0C)."}
