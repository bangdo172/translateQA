The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of <a2_0><b7_0>Downtown<b7_0/><a2_0/> in front of the Downtown Macy's (formerly the <a0_0><b5_0>Burdine's<b5_0/><a0_0/> headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have \"<a4_0><b9_0>NW<b9_0/><a4_0/>\" in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown, which is close to the coast, therefore, the \"NW\" and \"SW\" quadrants are much larger than the \"SE\" and \"NE\" quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., Tamiami Trail/<a1_0><b6_0>SW 8th St<a1_0/>)<b6_0/>, although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals."}
