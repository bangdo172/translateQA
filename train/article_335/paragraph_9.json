Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft (<a2_0><b6_0><b7_0>5 to 6<a2_0/> m<b7_0/><b6_0/>) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes <a3_0><b8_0>underground construction<b8_0/><a3_0/>, though some underground parking garages exist. For this reason, the mass transit systems in and around Miami are elevated or at-grade.[citation needed]"}
