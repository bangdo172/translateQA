In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map.[citation needed] At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the <a1_0>\u00eele Saint-Louis, the \u00eele de la Cit\u00e9<a1_0/>; a third one is the <a2_0>1827<a2_0/> artificially created \u00eele aux Cygnes. Modern Paris owes much to its late 19th century Second Empire remodelling by the <a0_0>Baron Haussmann<a0_0/>: many of modern Paris' busiest streets, avenues and boulevards today are a result of that city renovation. Paris also owes its style to its aligned street-fronts, distinctive cream-grey \"Paris stone\" building ornamentation, aligned top-floor balconies, and tree-lined boulevards. The high residential population of its city centre makes it much different from most other western global cities."}
