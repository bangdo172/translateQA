Open from <a1_0>1804<a1_0/>, these were the cemeteries of P\u00e8re Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the <a2_0>Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Saint-Ouen<a2_0/>, the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Pantin-Bobigny, the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Bagneux).[citation needed] Some of the most famous people in the world are buried in Parisian cemeteries."}
