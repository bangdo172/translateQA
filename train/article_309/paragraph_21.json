Each arrondissement has a number of members depending upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 36 members for the most populated (the 15th). The elected council members select the mayor. Sometimes the candidate who receives the most votes city-wide is not selected if the other candidate has won the support of the majority of council members. Mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb (<a3_0>2001-2014<a3_0/>) was elected by only a minority of city voters, but a <a1_0>majority of council members<a1_0/>. Once elected, the council plays a largely passive role in the city government; it meets only <a2_0>once a month<a2_0/>. The current council is divided between a coalition of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and extreme left; and 71 members for the centre right, plus a few members from smaller parties."}
