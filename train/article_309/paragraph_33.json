The Seine d\u00e9partement had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in <a1_0>1790<a1_0/>, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to govern as a unique entity. This problem was 'resolved' when its parent \"District de la r\u00e9gion parisienne\" (Paris region) was reorganised into several new departments from <a2_0>1968<a2_0/>: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three departments surrounding it. The Paris region was renamed <a3_0>\"\u00cele-de-France\"<a3_0/> in 1977, but the \"Paris region\" name is still commonly used today. Paris was reunited with its suburbs on <a4_0>January 1, 2016<a4_0/> when the M\u00e9tropole du Grand Paris came into existence."}
