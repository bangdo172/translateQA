It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the Paris Fire Brigade. Its headquarters is on <a1_0>Place Louis L\u00e9pine on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9<a1_0/>. There are <a2_0>30,200<a2_0/> officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than <a4_0>6,000<a4_0/> vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters. In addition to traditional police duties, the local police monitors the number of discount sales held by large stores (no more than two a year are allowed) and verify that, during summer holidays, at least one bakery is open in every neighbourhood. The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 (CRS), a unit formed in <a3_0>1944<a3_0/> right after the liberation of France. Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events."}
