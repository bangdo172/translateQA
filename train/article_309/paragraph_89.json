With Paris' growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, <a0_0>les Innocents<a0_0/>, were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from <a1_0>1786<a1_0/>, the contents of all Paris' parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris' stone mines outside the \"Porte d'Enfer\" city gate, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement. The process of moving bones from Cimeti\u00e8re des Innocents to the catacombs took place between <a2_0>1786 and 1814<a2_0/>; part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on <a3_0>the official tour of the catacombs<a3_0/>."}
