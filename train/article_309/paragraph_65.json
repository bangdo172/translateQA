A group of Parisian aristocrats, known as Trouv\u00e8res, became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadors were also popular. During the reign of <a2_0>Francois I<a2_0/>, the lute became popular in the French court, and a national musical printing house was established. During the Renaissance era, the French Boleroroyals \"disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy\". Baroque-era composers include Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and Fran\u00e7ois Couperin and were popular. The Conservatoire de Musique de Paris was founded in <a1_0>1795<a1_0/>. By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music. Romantic-era composers (in Paris) include Hector Berlioz (La Symphonie fantastique), Charles Gounod (Faust), Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns (Samson et Delilah), L\u00e9o Delibes (Lakm\u00e9) and Jules Massenet (Tha\u00efs), among others. <a3_0>Georges Bizet's<a3_0/> Carmen premiered 3 March 1875. Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon; Impressionist composers Claude Debussy ((La Mer) and Maurice Ravel (Bol\u00e9ro) also made significant contributions to piano (Clair de lune, Miroirs), orchestra, opera (Pall\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande), and other musical forms. Foreign-born composers have made their homes in Paris and have made significant contributions both with their works and their influence. They include Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (<a4_0>Poland<a4_0/>), Franz Liszt (Hungary), Jacques Offenbach (Germany), and Igor Stravinsky (Russia)."}
