They repelled an attempt by <a1_0>Joan of Arc<a1_0/> to liberate the city in 1429. A century later, during the French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League. On <a2_0>24 August 1572<a2_0/>, Paris was the site of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, when thousands of French Protestants were killed. The last of these wars, the eighth one, ended in 1594, after Henri IV had converted to Catholicism and was finally able to enter Paris as he supposedly declared Paris vaut bien une messe (\"Paris is well worth a Mass\"). The city had been neglected for decades; by the time of his assassination in <a3_0>1610<a3_0/>, <a4_0>Henry IV<a4_0/> had rebuilt the Pont Neuf, the first Paris bridge with sidewalks and not lined with buildings, linked with a new wing the Louvre to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges."}
