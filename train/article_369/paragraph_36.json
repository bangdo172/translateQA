As a result of their culture policies, North Indian music and dance gained popularity during the rule of <a1_0>the Mughals and Nizams<a1_0/>, and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (<a2_0>courtesans<a2_0/>). These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture, and were appointed to teach singing, poetry and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy. This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music, dholak ke geet (household <a3_0>songs based on local Folklore<a3_0/>), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. <a4_0>The state government<a4_0/> organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music."}
