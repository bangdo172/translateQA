Such crafts include: Bidriware, a metalwork handicraft from neighbouring Karnataka, which was popularised during <a0_0>the 18th century<a0_0/> and has since been granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag under the auspices of <a1_0>the WTO act<a1_0/>; and Zari and Zardozi, <a2_0>embroidery works on textile<a2_0/> that involve making elaborate designs using gold, silver and other metal threads. Another example of a handicraft drawn to Hyderabad is Kalamkari, <a3_0>a hand-painted or block-printed cotton textile<a3_0/> that comes from cities in Andhra Pradesh. This craft is distinguished in having both <a4_0>a Hindu style, known as Srikalahasti<a4_0/> and entirely done by hand, and an Islamic style, known as Machilipatnam that uses both hand and block techniques. Examples of Hyderabad's arts and crafts are housed in various museums including the Salar Jung Museum (housing \"one of the largest one-man-collections in the world\"), the AP State Archaeology Museum, the Nizam Museum, the City Museum and the Birla Science Museum."}
