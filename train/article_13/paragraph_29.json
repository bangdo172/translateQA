These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both <a2_0>morphology and behavior<a2_0/> during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to have an impact on the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e. selection for <a3_0>tameness<a3_0/>), and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced <a4_0>fear and <a8_0>aggression<a8_0/><a4_0/> compared to wolves.
