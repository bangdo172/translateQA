For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of <a3_0>anxiety<a3_0/>. Other health benefits are gained from exposure to <a0_0>immune-stimulating microorganisms<a0_0/>, which, according to the hygiene hypothesis, can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of <a1_0>social interactions<a1_0/> between humans. One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with <a4_0>strangers<a4_0/> when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not. In <a2_0>2015<a2_0/>, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners."}
