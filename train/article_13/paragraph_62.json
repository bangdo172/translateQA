Dogs can detect odour in one part per <a2_0>trillion<a2_0/>, as their brain's olfactory cortex is (relative to total brain size) <a1_0><a3_0>40 times larger<a3_0/><a1_0/> than humans. Dogs may have as many as 300 million odour receptors in their nose, while humans may have only 5 million. Each dog is trained specifically for the detection of single disease from the blood glucose level indicative to diabetes to cancer. To train a cancer dog requires 6 months. A Labrador Retriever called Daisy has detected <a4_0>551<a4_0/> cancer patients with an accuracy of 93 percent and received the Blue Cross (for pets) Medal for her life-saving skills."}
