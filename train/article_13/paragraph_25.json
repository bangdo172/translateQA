Dogs have been shown to learn by inference. A study with <a0_0>Rico<a0_0/> showed that he knew the labels of <a6_0>over 200<a6_0/> different items. He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure. Dogs have <a7_0>advanced<a7_0/> memory skills. A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie, \"<a1_0>Chaser<a1_0/>\", who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command <a8_0>over 1,000<a8_0/> words. Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as <a2_0>gesturing and pointing<a2_0/>, and to understand human voice commands. Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. A study showed compelling evidence that <a3_0>Australian dingos<a3_0/> can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving experiment, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans. Another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not. Modern domestic dogs use humans <a4_0>to solve their problems for them."}
