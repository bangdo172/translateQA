Canis is a Latin word meaning dog, and the list included the dog-like carnivores: the domestic dog, wolves, foxes and jackals. The dog was classified as Canis familiaris, which means \"Dog-family\" or the <a6_0>family dog<a6_0/>. On the next page he recorded the <a3_0>wolf<a3_0/> as <a7_0>Canis lupus<a7_0/>, which means \"Dog-wolf\". In 1978, a review aimed at reducing the number of recognized Canis species proposed that \"<a8_0>Canis dingo<a8_0/> is now generally regarded as a distinctive feral domestic dog. Canis familiaris is used for domestic dogs, although taxonomically it should probably be synonymous with Canis lupus.\" In <a9_0>1982<a9_0/>, the first edition of <a4_0>Mammal Species of the World<a4_0/> listed Canis familiaris under Canis lupus with the comment: \"Probably ancestor of and conspecific with the domestic dog, familiaris. Canis familiaris has page priority over Canis lupus, but both were published simultaneously in Linnaeus (1758), and Canis lupus has been universally used for this species\", which avoided classifying the wolf as the family dog. The dog is now listed among the many other Latin-named subspecies of Canis lupus as Canis lupus familiaris."}
