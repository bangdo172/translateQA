For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the <a0_0><b4_0>fields in the air gap<b4_0/><a0_0/> . Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using <a1_0><b5_0>FEA<b5_0/><a1_0/> or other tools the torque may be calculated as <a3_0>the <b7_0>integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector<b7_0/><a3_0/>. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed."}
