This makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where <a3_0><b7_0>high speed and light weight<b7_0/><a3_0/> are desirable. They are also commonly used in portable power tools, such as drills, sanders, circular and jig saws, where the motor's characteristics work well. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed <a0_0><b4_0>10,000<a0_0/> rpm<b4_0/>, while many similar miniature grinders exceed <a1_0><b5_0>30,000<a1_0/> rpm<b5_0/>."}
