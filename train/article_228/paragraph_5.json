The first commercially successful DC motors followed the invention by <a1_0><b6_0>Z\u00e9nobe Gramme<b6_0/><a1_0/> who, in 1871, reinvented Pacinotti's design. In 1873, Gramme showed that his dynamo could be used as a motor, which he demonstrated to great effect at exhibitions in <a4_0><b9_0>Vienna and Philadelphia<b9_0/><a4_0/> by connecting two such DC motors at a distance of up to <a2_0><b7_0>2 km<b7_0/><a2_0/> away from each other, one as a <a3_0><b8_0>generator<b8_0/><a3_0/>.
