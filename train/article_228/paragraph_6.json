Other Sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by <a4_0><b9_0>Thomas Edison<b9_0/><a4_0/>), allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided controls systems for electric operations. This allowed Sprague to use electric motors to invent the first <a2_0><b7_0>electric trolley system<b7_0/><a2_0/> in 1887\u201388 in Richmond VA, the electric elevator and control system in 1892, and the electric subway with independently powered centrally controlled cars, which were first installed in 1892 in Chicago by the <a3_0><b8_0>South Side Elevated Railway<b8_0/><a3_0/> where it became popularly known as the \"L\". Sprague's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry, while almost simultaneously another great inventor was developing its primary competitor, which would become much more widespread. The development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of a relatively <b5_0>small air gap<b5_0/> between rotor and stator. Efficient designs have a comparatively <a0_0>small air gap<a0_0/>. [a] The St. Louis motor, long used in classrooms to illustrate motor principles, is extremely inefficient for the same reason, as well as appearing nothing like a modern motor."}
