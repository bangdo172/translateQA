The dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires <a2_0>a <b6_0>multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set<b6_0/><a2_0/>. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than <a3_0><b7_0>eight times operating torque<b7_0/><a3_0/> have been calculated."}
