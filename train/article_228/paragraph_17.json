The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the <a1_0><b6_0>commutator<b6_0/><a1_0/>. Such motors are used in devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently, and often have high <a2_0><b7_0>starting<b7_0/><a2_0/>-torque demands. <a4_0>Multiple taps on the field coil provide<a4_0/> (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor can be used to agitate the drum (both <a3_0><b8_0>forwards and in reverse<b8_0/><a3_0/>) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature."}
