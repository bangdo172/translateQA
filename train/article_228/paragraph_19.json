The <a0_0>shape of the <b9_0>rotor bars<b9_0/><a0_0/> determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to be in the outer parts of the rotor cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes <a2_0><b7_0>lower<b7_0/><a2_0/>, and more current is in the <a1_0><b6_0>interior of the winding<b6_0/><a1_0/>. By <b5_0>shaping the bars<b5_0/> to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, effectively a <a3_0><b8_0>variable resistance<b8_0/><a3_0/> is inserted in the <a4_0>rotor circuit<a4_0/>. However, the majority of such motors have uniform bars."}
