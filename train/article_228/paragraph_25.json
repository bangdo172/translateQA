They start like <a2_0><b7_0>induction motors<b7_0/><a2_0/>, but when slip rate decreases sufficiently, the rotor (<a3_0><b8_0>a smooth cylinder<b8_0/><a3_0/>) <a0_0>becomes <b5_0>temporarily magnetized<b5_0/><a0_0/>. Its distributed poles make it act like a <a4_0><b9_0>PMSM<b9_0/><a4_0/>. The rotor material, like that of a common nail, will stay magnetized, but can also be demagnetized with little difficulty. Once running, the rotor poles <a1_0><b6_0>stay in place<b6_0/><a1_0/>; they do not drift."}
