In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively <a1_0><b5_0>constant light tension<b5_0/><a1_0/> to be applied to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a <a2_0>higher torque<a2_0/>), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as <a3_0><b7_0>gears or clutches<b7_0/><a3_0/>. In the computer <b6_0>gaming<b6_0/> world, torque motors are used in force <a0_0><b4_0>feedback steering wheels<b4_0/><a0_0/>."}
