In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a <a1_0><b6_0>DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid<b6_0/><a1_0/>. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the <a2_0><b7_0>magnetic field produced by the energized field winding<b7_0/><a2_0/>. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, <a3_0>the <b8_0>stepper motor may not rotate continuously<b8_0/><a3_0/>; instead, it \"steps\"\u2014starts and then quickly stops again\u2014from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn <a4_0>forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down<a4_0/> arbitrarily at any time."}
