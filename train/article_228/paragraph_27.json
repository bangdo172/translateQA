If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless DC motor, a specialized form of a PM DC motor. Optimized for <a0_0><b3_0>rapid acceleration<b3_0/><a0_0/>, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any <a1_0><b4_0>iron core<b4_0/><a1_0/>. The rotor can take the form of a <a2_0><b5_0>winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting<b5_0/> structure<a2_0/> comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux."}
