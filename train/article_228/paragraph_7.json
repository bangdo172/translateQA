Industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts, belts, compressed air or <a2_0><b6_0>hydraulic pressure<b6_0/><a2_0/>. Instead every machine could be equipped with its own electric motor, providing easy control at the point of use, and improving power transmission efficiency. Electric motors applied in <a1_0><b5_0>agriculture<b5_0/><a1_0/> eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water. Household uses of electric motors reduced heavy labor <a3_0><b7_0>in the home<b7_0/><a3_0/> and made higher standards of convenience, comfort and safety possible.
