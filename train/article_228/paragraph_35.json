Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either <a0_0><b3_0>linear stepper motors or servomotors<b3_0/><a0_0/> with closed-loop analog control systems."}
