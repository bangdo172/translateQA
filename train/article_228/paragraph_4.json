Following Sturgeon's work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor made with the intention of commercial use was built by the American inventor <a1_0><b6_0>Thomas Davenport<b6_0/><a1_0/>, which he patented in 1837. The motors ran at up to <a4_0><b9_0>600 revolutions per minute<b9_0/><a4_0/>, and powered machine tools and a printing press. Due to <a2_0>the <b7_0>high cost of primary battery power<b7_0/><a2_0/>, the motors were commercially unsuccessful and Davenport went bankrupt. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors but all encountered the same battery power cost issues. No <a3_0><b8_0>electricity distribution<b8_0/><a3_0/> had been developed at the time. Like Sturgeon's motor, there was no practical commercial market for these motors."}
