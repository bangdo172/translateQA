The motor's armature current is supplied through the <a2_0><b6_0>stationary brushes<b6_0/><a2_0/> in contact with the revolving <b5_0>commutator<b5_0/>, which causes required current reversal and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the rotor rotates from pole to pole. In absence of such current reversal, the motor would <a0_0><b4_0>brake to a stop<b4_0/><a0_0/>. In light of significant advances in the past few decades due to improved technologies in electronic controller, sensorless control, induction motor, and permanent magnet motor fields, electromechanically commutated motors are increasingly being displaced by <a3_0><b7_0>externally commutated induction and permanent-magnet<a3_0/> motors<b7_0/>."}
