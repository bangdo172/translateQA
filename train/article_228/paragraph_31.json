For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit, where a <a2_0><b7_0>position sensor<b7_0/><a2_0/> defines home position and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a <a3_0><b8_0>bidirectional<b8_0/><a3_0/> counter in the printer's microprocessor keeps track of print-head position."}
