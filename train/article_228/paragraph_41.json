Usually, electrostatic motors are the dual of <a1_0><b6_0>conventional coil-based motors<b6_0/><a1_0/>. They typically require a <a2_0><b7_0>high-voltage<b7_0/><a2_0/> power supply, although very small motors employ lower voltages. Conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion, and require high current at low voltages. In the 1750s, the first <b9_0>electrostatic motors<b9_0/> were developed by <a3_0><b8_0>Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Gordon<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Today the <a4_0>electrostatic motor<a4_0/> finds frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) where their drive voltages are below 100 volts, and where moving, charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores. Also, the molecular machinery which runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors.[citation needed]"}
