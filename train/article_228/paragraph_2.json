After Jedlik solved the technical problems of the continuous rotation with the invention of the <a3_0>commutator<a3_0/>, he called his early devices \"<a2_0><b7_0>electromagnetic self-rotors<b7_0/><a2_0/>\". Although they were used only for instructional purposes, in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical DC motors: the stator, <a1_0><b6_0>rotor<b6_0/><a1_0/> and <b8_0>commutator<b8_0/>. The device employed no <a4_0><b9_0>permanent magnets<b9_0/><a4_0/>, as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings."}
