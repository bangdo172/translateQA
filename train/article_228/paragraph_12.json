This creates <a2_0>friction<a2_0/>. <b5_0>Sparks<b5_0/> are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between <b6_0>commutator<b6_0/> sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections \u2013 and hence coil ends \u2013 momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils causes the <b7_0>voltage<b7_0/> across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the <a3_0><b8_0>maximum speed<b8_0/><a3_0/> of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; <a0_0>sparking<a0_0/> generates RFI. <a4_0><b9_0>Brushes<b9_0/><a4_0/> eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor."}
