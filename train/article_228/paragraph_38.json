Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by <a2_0>magnetic core saturation or safe operating <b5_0>temperature rise and voltage<b5_0/><a2_0/>, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators."}
