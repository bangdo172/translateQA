The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically <a0_0><b4_0>reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings<a0_0/> as the shaft rotates<b4_0/>. Thus, every brushed DC motor has <a1_0><b5_0>AC<b5_0/><a1_0/> flowing through its <b7_0>rotating<b7_0/> windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an <a2_0><b6_0>external<b6_0/><a2_0/> source of electric power to the <a3_0>rotating<a3_0/> armature."}
