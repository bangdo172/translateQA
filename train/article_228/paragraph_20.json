An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the <a0_0>rotor circuit<a0_0/>. Resistors allow control of the <a1_0><b5_0>motor speed<b5_0/><a1_0/>, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the <a3_0><b4_0><b7_0>rotor circuit<b7_0/><b4_0/><a3_0/> and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an <a2_0><b6_0>inverter or separate motor-generator<b6_0/><a2_0/>."}
