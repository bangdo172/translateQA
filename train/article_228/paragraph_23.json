In this usage, the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors engine speed by counting <a0_0><b4_0>electrical pulses<b4_0/><a0_0/> from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and, depending on the speed, makes <a2_0><b6_0>small<b6_0/><a2_0/> adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the <b5_0>return spring<b5_0/> and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will <a3_0><b7_0>reduce the current being applied to the motor<b7_0/><a3_0/>, causing the <a1_0>return spring<a1_0/> to pull back and close the throttle."}
