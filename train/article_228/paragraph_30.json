Servomotors are used in applications such as <a0_0><b5_0>machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems<b5_0/><a0_0/>. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for <a1_0><b6_0>speed, torque, and power<b6_0/><a1_0/>. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as <a2_0><b7_0>winding inductance and rotor inertia<b7_0/><a2_0/> are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use <a3_0><b8_0>conventional AC or DC motors<b8_0/><a3_0/> and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. <a4_0>As dynamic response requirements increase<a4_0/>, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications."}
