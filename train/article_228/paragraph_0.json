Small motors may be found in <a4_0>electric watches<a4_0/>. General-purpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest of electric motors are used for ship propulsion, <b9_0>pipeline compression<b9_0/> and pumped-storage applications with ratings reaching <a0_0><b5_0>100 megawatts<b5_0/><a0_0/>. Electric motors may be classified by electric power source type, internal construction, application, type of motion output, and so on."}
