This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called \"<a0_0><b4_0>back electromotive force<b4_0/><a0_0/> (emf)\". The voltage is proportional to <a1_0>the <b5_0>running speed of the motor<b5_0/><a1_0/>. The <a2_0>back emf of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance<a2_0/> and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower <b6_0>back emf results, and <a3_0><b7_0>more current is drawn from the supply<b7_0/><b6_0/><a3_0/>. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load."}
