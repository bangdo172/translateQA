Reducing the load will cause the motor to <a0_0><b4_0>speed up<b4_0/><a0_0/>, and increasing the load will cause the motor to <a1_0><b5_0>slow down<b5_0/><a1_0/> until the load and motor torque are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the <a2_0><b6_0>secondary resistors<b6_0/><a2_0/> and can be very significant.
