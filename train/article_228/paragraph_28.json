This is especially true if the windings use aluminum rather than the heavier copper. But because there is no metal mass in the rotor to act as a <a4_0><b9_0>heat sink<b9_0/><a4_0/>, even small coreless motors must often be cooled by <a3_0><b8_0>forced air<b8_0/><a3_0/>. <a0_0><b5_0>Overheating<b5_0/><a0_0/> might be an issue for coreless DC motor designs."}
