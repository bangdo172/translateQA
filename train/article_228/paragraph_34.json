They were used for the same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the <a0_0><b4_0>precision and speed limitations<b4_0/><a0_0/> of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives\u2014the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive\u2014thus newer hard disk drives use <a1_0><b5_0>voice coil-based head actuator systems<b5_0/><a1_0/>. (The term \"voice coil\" in this connection is historic; it refers to <a3_0>the <b7_0>structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker<b7_0/><a3_0/>. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings back and forth, something like a blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, like a voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move <a2_0><b6_0>perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force<b6_0/><a2_0/>.)"}
