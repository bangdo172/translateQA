Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for <a0_0>speed control<a0_0/>. PM fields (<a1_0>stators<a1_0/>) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the <b6_0>field winding<b6_0/>. Most larger DC motors are of the \"<b5_0>dynamo<b5_0/>\" type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of <a3_0><b7_0>flux<b7_0/><a3_0/>. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines."}
