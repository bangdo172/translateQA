Another way of saying this is that it has <a0_0><b5_0>zero<b5_0/><a0_0/> <b6_0>slip<b6_0/> under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must <a1_0>slip<a1_0/> to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a <a3_0><b8_0>DC field<b8_0/><a3_0/>. <a4_0><b9_0>Slip rings and brushes<b9_0/><a4_0/> are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires <b7_0>manual<b7_0/> starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded <a2_0>manually<a2_0/> operated switch."}
