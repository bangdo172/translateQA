For example, <a0_0>\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437<a0_0/> ('<a3_0>frost<a3_0/>') is transliterated moroz, and <a1_0>\u043c\u044b\u0448\u044c<a1_0/> ('<a4_0>mouse<a4_0/>'), mysh or my\u0161'. Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian-speaking typists in favor of <b9_0>the extension of <a2_0><b6_0>Unicode character encoding<b9_0/><b6_0/>,<a2_0/> which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet. Free programs leveraging this Unicode extension are available which allow users to type Russian characters, even on Western 'QWERTY' keyboards."}
