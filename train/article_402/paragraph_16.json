Some linguists divide the dialects of Russian into two primary regional groupings, <a0_0><b3_0>\"Northern\" and \"Southern\"<b3_0/><a0_0/>, with Moscow lying on the <b4_0>zone of transition<b4_0/> between the two. Others divide the language into three groupings, <a1_0>Northern, Central (or Middle) and Southern<a1_0/>, with Moscow lying in the Central region. All dialects also divided in <b6_0>two main chronological categories<b6_0/>: the dialects of primary formation (the territory of the Eastern Rus' or Muscovy, roughly consists of the modern Central and Northwestern Federal districts); and secondary formation (other territory). Dialectology within Russia recognizes <b5_0>dozens<b5_0/> of smaller-scale variants. The dialects often show distinct and <a2_0>non-standard features of pronunciation and intonation, vocabulary and grammar<a2_0/>.
