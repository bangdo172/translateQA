The consonants typically come in <b7_0>plain vs. palatalized pairs<b7_0/>, which are traditionally called hard and soft. (The hard consonants are often velarized, especially before front vowels, as in <a3_0>Irish<a3_0/>). The standard language, based on the <a2_0>Moscow dialect<a2_0/>, possesses <b8_0>heavy<b8_0/> stress and <b9_0>moderate<b9_0/> variation in pitch. Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels tend to be <a4_0>reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear schwa<a4_0/>. (See also: vowel reduction in Russian.)"}
