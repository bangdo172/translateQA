To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief, <a7_0>Albert<a7_0/> took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with <a2_0><a8_0><b22_0>chronic stomach trouble<b22_0/><a8_0/><a2_0/>. In August, Victoria and Albert visited <a18_0>their son, the Prince of Wales<a18_0/>, who was attending <a3_0>army manoeuvres<a3_0/> near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney. In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son <a19_0>had slept with <a14_0>an actress in Ireland<a19_0/><a14_0/>. Appalled, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying, to confront him. By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell. He was diagnosed with <a11_0><a17_0>typhoid fever<a17_0/><a11_0/> by William Jenner, and died on <a12_0>14 December <a9_0>1861<a12_0/><a9_0/>. Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband's death on worry over the <a4_0><b23_0><b24_0>Prince of Wales's philandering<b24_0/><b23_0/><a4_0/>. He had been \"killed by that dreadful business\", she said. She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances, and rarely set foot in London in the following years. Her seclusion earned her the nickname \"<a13_0>widow of Windsor<a13_0/>\"."}
