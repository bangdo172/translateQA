Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to <a13_0>18 months in jail<a13_0/>. In a similar attack in <a14_0>1849<a14_0/>, unemployed Irishman <a8_0>William Hamilton<a8_0/> fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London.

As Victoria was riding in a carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation."}
