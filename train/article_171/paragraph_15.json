Victoria <a11_0>disliked<a11_0/> the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little time for her to rest. She objected on the grounds of the King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy, and forced Victoria to continue the tours. At <a7_0>Ramsgate<a7_0/> in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever, which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence.
