Ponsonby and Randall Davidson, Dean of Windsor, who had both seen early drafts, advised Victoria against publication, on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair. The manuscript was destroyed. In early 1884, Victoria did publish More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands, a sequel to her earlier book, which she dedicated to her \"devoted personal attendant and faithful friend <a6_0>John <b17_0>Brown<b17_0/><a6_0/>\".

He was \"the dearest of my dear sons\", she lamented. The following month, Victoria's youngest child, Beatrice, met and fell in love with <a8_0>Prince Henry of Battenberg<a8_0/> <a9_0>at the wedding of Victoria's granddaughter Princess Victoria of Hesse<a9_0/> and by Rhine to Henry's brother Prince Louis of Battenberg. Beatrice and Henry planned to marry, but Victoria opposed the match at first, wishing to keep Beatrice at home to act as her companion. After a year, she was won around to the marriage by Henry and Beatrice's promise to remain living with and attending her."}
