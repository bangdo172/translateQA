Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the <b6_0>Cretaceous<b6_0/> transgression, <a0_0>one-third<a0_0/> of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the <a1_0><a2_0><b7_0>Phanerozoic<a2_0/><a1_0/>.<b7_0/> Mid-ocean ridge activity\u2014or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges\u2014enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from <a3_0>North America<a3_0/> include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now <a4_0>India<a4_0/>, massive lava beds called the <b8_0>Deccan Traps<b8_0/> were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene."}
