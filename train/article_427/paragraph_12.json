This continental collision resulted in the <b8_0>Hercynian orogeny<b8_0/> in Europe, and <a2_0>the Alleghenian orogeny<a2_0/> in North America; it also <b7_0>extended the newly uplifted Appalachians<b7_0/> southwestward as <a3_0>the Ouachita Mountains<a3_0/>. In the same time frame, much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains. There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous <a4_0><b9_0>the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys<b9_0/><a4_0/>. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow Ural Ocean (which was closed by the collision of Baltica, and Siberia continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean."}
