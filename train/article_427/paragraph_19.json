Europe and Greenland were still connected. <a1_0>North America<a1_0/> and Asia were still intermittently joined by <b8_0>a land bridge<b8_0/>, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate. The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift <a2_0>the Rocky Mountains<a2_0/> in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the <a3_0>Neogene<a3_0/>); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other.
