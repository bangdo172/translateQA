During this time, the Earth's crust cooled enough that <b6_0>rocks and continental plates began to form<b6_0/>. Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter, that plate <b7_0>tectonic activity<b7_0/> was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of <a2_0><b8_0>crustal material<b8_0/><a2_0/>.
