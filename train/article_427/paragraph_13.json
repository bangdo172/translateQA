Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (<a1_0>Panthalassa<a1_0/>, the universal sea), and the <a2_0>Paleo-Tethys Ocean<a2_0/>, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. <b7_0><b8_0>The <a3_0>Cimmeria<b8_0/><a3_0/> continent<b7_0/> rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of <a4_0>the Mesozoic Era<a4_0/>. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (\"continental climate\") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea."}
