The continent <a1_0><b7_0>Euramerica<b7_0/> (or Laurussia)<a1_0/> was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn. In these near-deserts, the <a2_0><b8_0>Old Red Sandstone<b8_0/><a2_0/> sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron (hematite) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising <a3_0>the northern Appalachian Mountains<a3_0/> and forming the Caledonian Mountains in Great Britain and Scandinavia. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of Gondwana. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow <b9_0>seas<b9_0/>. The deep, enormous <a4_0>Panthalassa<a4_0/> (the \"universal ocean\") covered the rest of the planet. Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys, Proto-Tethys, Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica)."}
