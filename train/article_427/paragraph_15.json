The Jurassic <b6_0>North Atlantic Ocean<b6_0/> was relatively narrow, while the <b7_0>South Atlantic<b7_0/> did not open until the following <a3_0>Cretaceous Period<a3_0/>, when Gondwana itself rifted apart. The Tethys Sea closed, and the Neotethys basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of glaciation. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. <b9_0>The Jurassic<b9_0/> geological record is good in western Europe, where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and the renowned late Jurassic <a4_0>lagerst\u00e4tten of Holzmaden and Solnhofen<a4_0/>. In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface. Though the epicontinental <b8_0>Sundance Sea<b8_0/> left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the alluvial deposits of the Morrison Formation. The first of several massive batholiths were emplaced in the northern Cordillera beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the Nevadan orogeny. Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom."}
