In addition, many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the <a3_0>Pleistocene<a3_0/> glaciers and rose as much as 180 metres (591 ft) over <b7_0>the late Pleistocene and Holocene<b7_0/>, and are still rising today. The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known from Vermont, Quebec, Ontario and Michigan. Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin. Post-glacial rebound in Scandinavia resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the Baltic Sea, including much of Finland. The region continues to rise, still causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe. The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of Hudson Bay, as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial <a4_0><b8_0>Tyrrell Sea<b8_0/><a4_0/> phase, to near its present boundaries."}
