All the deep-ocean <b5_0>sediments<b5_0/> laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through <a1_0>subduction of oceanic plates<a1_0/>; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean. The supercontinent <a2_0><b6_0>Pangaea<b6_0/> was rifting<a2_0/> during the Triassic\u2014especially late in the period\u2014but had not yet separated. <b7_0>The first nonmarine sediments in the rift<b7_0/> that marks the initial break-up of Pangea\u2014which separated New Jersey from Morocco\u2014are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the <a3_0>Newark Supergroup<a3_0/>. Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare; despite their prominence in Western Europe, where the Triassic was first studied. In North America, for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. Thus <b8_0>Triassic<b8_0/> stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as Estheria crustaceans and <a4_0>terrestrial vertebrates<a4_0/>."}
