It is relatively conservative, and generally closest to early Buddhism. The name Therav\u0101da comes from the <a1_0>ancestral Sth\u0101vir\u012bya<a1_0/>, one of the early Buddhist schools, from which the Theravadins claim descent. After unsuccessfully trying to modify the Vinaya, a small group of \"elderly members\", i.e. sthaviras, broke away from the majority Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika during the Second Buddhist council, giving rise to the Sthavira sect. Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the <a2_0>Pali Canon<a2_0/> as the original version of scripture. They also emphasized Theravada being rational and scientific."}
