He mentions less likely possibilities as well. Having argued that the cosmological statements in the Upanishads also reflect a <a1_0>contemplative<a1_0/> tradition, he argues that the <a2_0>Nasadiya Sukta<a2_0/> contains evidence for a contemplative tradition, even as early as the late Rig Vedic period."}
