The most ancient sustained expression of yogic ideas is found in the early sermons of <a1_0>the Buddha<a1_0/>. One key innovative teaching of the Buddha was that meditative absorption must be combined with <a3_0>liberating<a3_0/> cognition. The difference between the Buddha's teaching and the yoga presented in early <a2_0>Brahminic<a2_0/> texts is striking. Meditative states alone are not an end, for according to the Buddha, even the highest meditative state is not liberating. Instead of attaining a complete cessation of thought, some sort of mental activity must take place: a liberating cognition, based on the practice of mindful awareness."}
