Initially it was known as Bodhisattvay\u0101na (the \"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na never had nor ever attempted to have a separate <a1_0>Vinaya<a1_0/> or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhik\u1e63u or bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b adhering to the Mah\u0101y\u0101na formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mah\u0101y\u0101na was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and non-Mah\u0101y\u0101na monks in India often lived in the same <a2_0>monasteries<a2_0/> side by side."}
