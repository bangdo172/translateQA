Buddhism denies a <a4_0>creator<a4_0/> deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: <a0_0>the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community)<a0_0/>. Taking \"refuge in the triple gem\" has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are <a2_0>Ten Meritorious Deeds<a2_0/> including, giving charity to reduce the <a5_0>greediness<a5_0/>; following ethical precepts; <a3_0>renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic<a3_0/>; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; <a1_0>cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment<a1_0/>; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the <a6_0>Mahayana<a6_0/> tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas."}
