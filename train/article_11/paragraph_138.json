The goal of the council was <a1_0>to record the Buddha's teachings<a1_0/>. <a2_0>Up\u0101li<a2_0/> recited the vinaya. <a3_0>\u0100nanda<a3_0/>, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the <a4_0>dhamma<a4_0/>. These became the basis of the Tripitaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in the last century BCE. Both the s\u016btras and the vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Gautama Buddha's previous lives, and various other subjects."}
