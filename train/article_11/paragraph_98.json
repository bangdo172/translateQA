As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission. In the first council, <a1_0>\u0100nanda<a1_0/>, a cousin of the Buddha and his personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses (<a2_0>s\u016btras<a2_0/>, P\u0101li suttas) of the Buddha, and, according to some sources, the <a3_0>abhidhamma<a3_0/>. Up\u0101li, another disciple, recited the monastic rules (vinaya). Most scholars regard the traditional accounts of the council as greatly exaggerated if not entirely fictitious.[note 36]Richard Gombrich noted Sariputta led communal recitations of the Buddha's teaching for preservation in the Buddha's lifetime in Sangiti Sutta (Digha Nikaya #33), and something similar to the First Council must have taken place to compose Buddhist scriptures."}
