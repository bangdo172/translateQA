These various defilements are traditionally summed up as greed, hatred and delusion. These are believed deeply rooted afflictions of the mind that create <a2_0>suffering and stress<a2_0/>. To be free from suffering and stress, these defilements must be permanently uprooted through internal investigation, analyzing, experiencing, and understanding of the true nature of those defilements by using jh\u0101na, a technique of the Noble Eightfold Path. It then leads the meditator to realize the Four Noble Truths, Enlightenment and <a3_0>Nibb\u0101na<a3_0/>. Nibb\u0101na is the ultimate goal of Theravadins."}
