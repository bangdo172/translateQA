The word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in English including <a0_0>suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness, sorrow, affliction, anxiety, dissatisfaction, discomfort, anguish, stress, misery, and frustration<a0_0/>. Although the term is often translated as \"suffering\", its philosophical meaning is more analogous to \"<a1_0><a4_0><a5_0>disquietude<a5_0/><a4_0/><a1_0/>\" as in the condition of being disturbed. As such, \"suffering\" is too narrow a translation with \"negative emotional connotations\"[web 9] that can give the impression that the Buddhist view is pessimistic, but Buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but <a2_0>realistic<a2_0/>. In English-language Buddhist literature translated from P\u0101li, \"dukkha\" is often left untranslated, so as to encompass its full range of meaning.[note 8]"}
