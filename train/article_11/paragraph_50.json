Traditionally, a bodhisattva is anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated <a1_0>bodhicitta<a1_0/>, which is a spontaneous wish to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. Theravada Buddhism primarily uses the term in relation to Gautama Buddha's previous existences, but has traditionally acknowledged and respected the bodhisattva path as well.[web 17]"}
