Everything is in constant flux, and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing. Things are constantly coming into being, and <a4_0>ceasing to be<a4_0/>. Since nothing lasts, there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience. According to the doctrine of impermanence, life embodies this flux <a1_0>in the aging process, the cycle of rebirth (<a5_0>sa\u1e43s\u0101ra<a5_0/>), and in any experience of loss<a1_0/>.
