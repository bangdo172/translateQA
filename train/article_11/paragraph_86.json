However, the Buddha was not anti-Vedic, and declared that the Veda in its true form was declared by \"Kashyapa\" to certain rishis, who by severe penances had acquired the power to see by divine eyes. He names the Vedic rishis, and declared that the original Veda of the rishis[note 25] was altered by a few Brahmins who introduced <a2_0>animal sacrifices<a2_0/>. The Buddha says that it was on this alteration of the true Veda that he refused to pay respect to the <a3_0>Vedas<a3_0/> of his time. However, he did not denounce the union with Brahman,[note 26] or the idea of the self uniting with the Self. At the same time, the traditional Hindu itself gradually underwent profound changes, transforming it into what is recognized as early Hinduism."}
