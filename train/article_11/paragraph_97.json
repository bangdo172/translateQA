Its main scriptures are the Vinaya Pitaka and the four principal Nikayas or Agamas. Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, so most scholars conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the Three marks of existence, the Five Aggregates, dependent origination, karma and <a1_0>rebirth<a1_0/>, the Four Noble Truths, the <a2_0>Noble Eightfold<a2_0/> Path, and nirvana.
