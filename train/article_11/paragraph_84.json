Buddhism arose in <a0_0>Greater Magadha<a0_0/>, which stretched from Sravasti, the capital of Kosala in the north-west, to <a1_0>Rajagrha<a1_0/> in the south east. This land, to the east of aryavarta, the land of the Aryas, was recognized as non-Vedic. Other Vedic texts reveal a dislike of the people of Magadha, in all probability because the Magadhas at this time were not Brahmanised.[page needed] It was not until the <a2_0>2nd or 3rd centuries<a2_0/> BCE that the eastward spread of Brahmanism into Greater Magadha became significant. Ideas that developed in Greater Magadha prior to this were not subject to Vedic influence. These include rebirth and karmic retribution that appear in a number of movements in Greater Magadha, including Buddhism. These movements inherited notions of rebirth and karmic retribution from an earlier culture[page needed]"}
