There are conflicting interpretations of the tath\u0101gatagarbha in Mah\u0101y\u0101na thought. The idea may be traced to Abhidharma, and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nik\u0101yas. In Tibetan Buddhism, according to the <a2_0>Sakya<a2_0/> school, tath\u0101gatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. In Nyingma, tath\u0101gatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. According to the Gelug school, it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty (i.e. dependently originated). According to the <a3_0>Jonang<a3_0/> school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc. when adventitious obscurations are removed. The \"Tath\u0101gatagarbha Sutras\" are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature. Even though this collection was generally ignored in India, East Asian Buddhism provides some significance to these texts."}
