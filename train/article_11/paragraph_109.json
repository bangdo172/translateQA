The support of A\u015boka and his descendants led to the construction of more <a1_0>st\u016bpas<a1_0/> (<a2_0>Buddhist religious memorials<a2_0/>) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands\u2014particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia, beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of Sri Lanka south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Therav\u0101da Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of Southeast Asia."}
