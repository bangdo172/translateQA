Coconut trees abound in the Pacific's tropical islands. Copra, <a2_0>the meat of the coconut<a2_0/>, yields coconut oil (1 liter for every <a3_0>6 to 10<a3_0/> coconuts). In 2009, a <a4_0>57<a4_0/> kW solar power plant was installed, the largest in the Pacific at the time, including New Zealand. It is estimated that 330 kW of solar and 450 kW of wind power would be required to make the College of the Marshall Islands energy self-sufficient. Marshalls Energy Company (MEC), a government entity, provides the islands with electricity. In 2008, 420 solar home systems of 200 Wp each were installed on Ailinglaplap Atoll, sufficient for limited electricity use."}
