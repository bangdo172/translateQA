This approximation has an error of about <a2_0>one day<a2_0/> per <b6_0>3,300 years<b6_0/> with respect to the mean tropical year. However, because of the precession of the equinoxes, the error with respect to the vernal equinox (which occurs, on average, 365.24237 days apart near 2000) is <a3_0>1 day<a3_0/> every 7,700 years, assuming a constant time interval between vernal equinoxes, which is not true. By any criterion, the Gregorian calendar is substantially more accurate than the <a4_0><b7_0>1 day<b7_0/> in 128 years<a4_0/> error of the Julian calendar (average year 365.25 days)."}
