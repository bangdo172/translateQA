The Church of Alexandria celebrated Easter on <b6_0>the Sunday after the 14th day of the moon<b6_0/> (computed using the <a2_0>Metonic cycle<a2_0/>) that falls on or after the <b7_0>vernal equinox<b7_0/>, which they placed on <a3_0>21 March<a3_0/>. However, the Church of Rome still regarded <a4_0>25 March<a4_0/> as the equinox (until 342) and used a different cycle to compute the day of the moon. In the Alexandrian system, since the 14th day of the Easter moon could fall at earliest on 21 March its first day could fall no earlier than 8 March and no later than 5 April. This meant that Easter varied between 22 March and 25 April. In Rome, Easter was not allowed to fall later than 21 April, that being the day of the Parilia or birthday of Rome and a pagan festival.The first day of the Easter moon could fall no earlier than 5 March and no later than 2 April."}
