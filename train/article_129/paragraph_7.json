Firstly, he proposed a correction to the <a0_0>length of the year<a0_0/>. <b7_0>The mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long<b7_0/>. As the average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days, the <b6_0>Julian year<b6_0/> is almost <a1_0>11 minutes<a1_0/> longer than the mean tropical year. The discrepancy results in a drift of about <a2_0>three days<a2_0/> every 400 years. Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see Accuracy). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the <b8_0>vernal equinox<b8_0/> falling on <a4_0>10 or 11 March<a4_0/> instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of <a3_0>21 March<a3_0/>, and if unreformed it would drift further. Lilius proposed that the 10-day drift should be corrected by <b9_0>deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years,<b9_0/> thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 March."}
