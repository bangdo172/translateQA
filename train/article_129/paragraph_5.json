A regular Gregorian year consists of <a1_0>365<a1_0/> days, but as in the Julian calendar, in a leap year, a leap day is added to February. In the Julian calendar a leap year occurs <a2_0>every 4 years<a2_0/>, but the Gregorian calendar omits 3 leap days <a3_0><b6_0>every 400 years<b6_0/><a3_0/>. In the Julian calendar, this <b8_0>leap day was inserted by doubling <a4_0>24 February<a4_0/>,<b8_0/> and the Gregorian reform did not change the date of the leap day. In the modern period, it has become customary to number the days from the beginning of the month, and February 29th is often considered as the leap day. Some churches, notably the <b7_0>Roman Catholic Church<b7_0/>, delay February festivals after the 23rd by one day in leap years."}
