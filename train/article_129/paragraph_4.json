The motivation for the reform was to bring the date for the <a2_0>celebration of Easter<a2_0/> to the time of the year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. Because the celebration of Easter was tied to the <a3_0>spring equinox<a3_0/>, the Roman Catholic Church considered <b8_0>the steady drift in the date of Easter caused by the year being <a4_0>slightly too long<b8_0/><a4_0/> to be undesirable. The reform was adopted initially by the Catholic countries of Europe. Protestants and Eastern Orthodox countries continued to use the traditional Julian calendar and adopted the Gregorian reform after a time, for the sake of convenience in international trade. The last European country to adopt the reform was Greece, in 1923."}
