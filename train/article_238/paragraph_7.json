It was rediscovered in <b11_0>1951<b11_0/> after having been thought extinct since the 1620s. It is important as an <a6_0>example of a Lazarus species<a6_0/>. The government has a programme to protect it, including restoration of a habitat area. The <a2_0><a7_0>Bermuda rock skink<a7_0/><a2_0/> was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda, discounting the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches. Recently through genetic DNA studies, scientists have discovered that a species of turtle, the <a3_0><b13_0>diamondback terrapin<b13_0/><a3_0/>, previously thought to have been introduced, pre-dated the arrival of humans in the archipelago. As <a8_0>this species spends most of its time in brackish ponds<a8_0/>, some question whether it should be classified as a land vertebrate to compete with the skink's unique status."}
