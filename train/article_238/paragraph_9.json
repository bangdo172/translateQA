There is effectively no ethnic distinction between <a0_0><b5_0>black and white<a0_0/> Bermudians<b5_0/>, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, <a1_0><b6_0>white Protestants of English heritage<b6_0/><a1_0/> were the distinct majority, with white minorities of <b7_0>Irish<b7_0/> (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico. By the 19th century, the <b8_0>white ethnically-English Bermudians<b8_0/> had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"<a2_0>coloured<a2_0/>\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as \"coloured\" are today described as \"black\", or \"of African heritage\", which <a3_0>obscures their non-African heritage<a3_0/> (those previously described as \"coloured\" who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The <b9_0>number of persons born in <a4_0>Asian<a4_0/> countries<b9_0/> doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks have remained in the majority, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the West Indies."}
