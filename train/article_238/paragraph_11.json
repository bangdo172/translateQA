As <b5_0>Spain and Portugal<b5_0/> sourced most of their slaves from <a1_0>South-West Africa<a1_0/> (the Portuguese through ports in modern-day Angola; the Spanish purchased most of their African slaves from Portuguese traders, and from Arabs whose slave trading was centred in Zanzibar). <a2_0>Genetic studies<a2_0/> have consequently shown that the African ancestry of <b6_0><b7_0>black Bermudians<b7_0/><b6_0/> (other than those resulting from recent immigration from the British West Indian islands) is largely from the a band across southern Africa, from Angola to Mozambique, which is similar to what is revealed in Latin America, but distinctly different from the blacks of the West Indies and the United States."}
