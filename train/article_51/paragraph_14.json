The most commonly used kind of URI starts with <b6_0>http:<b6_0/> and identifies <b7_0>a resource to be retrieved over the <a2_0>Hypertext Transfer Protocol<a2_0/> (HTTP)<b7_0/>. Many browsers also support a variety of other prefixes, such as https: for HTTPS, ftp: for the <a3_0>File Transfer Protocol<a3_0/>, and file: for local files. Prefixes that the web browser cannot directly handle are <b8_0>often handed off to another application entirely<b8_0/>. For example, mailto: URIs are usually passed to <b9_0>the user's default e-mail application<b9_0/>, and news: URIs are passed to the user's <a4_0>default newsgroup reader<a4_0/>."}
