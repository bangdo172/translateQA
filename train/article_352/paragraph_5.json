The inventor <a2_0>Anton Freissler<a2_0/> developed the ideas of von Siemens and built up a successful enterprise in Austria-Hungary. The safety and speed of electric elevators were significantly enhanced by <a3_0>Frank Sprague<a3_0/> who added floor control, automatic elevators, acceleration control of cars, and safeties. His elevator ran faster and with larger loads than hydraulic or steam elevators, and 584 electric elevators were installed before Sprague sold his company to the <a4_0>Otis Elevator Company<a4_0/> in 1895. Sprague also developed the idea and technology for multiple elevators in a single shaft."}
