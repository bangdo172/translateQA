The newest invention knows even where people are located and how many on which floor because of their identification, <a2_0>either for the purposes of evacuating the building or for security reasons<a2_0/>. Another way to prevent this issue is to treat everyone travelling from one floor to another as one group and to allocate only one car for that group."}
