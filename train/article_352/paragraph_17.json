The system lets them know which car to wait for, instead of everyone boarding the next car. In this way, <a1_0>travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers<a1_0/>, and <a2_0>the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank<a2_0/>. Although travel time is reduced, <a3_0>passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart<a3_0/>. During the down peak period the benefit of destination control will be limited as passengers have a common destination."}
