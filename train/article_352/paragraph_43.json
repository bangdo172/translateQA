As of 2006, all states except Kansas, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota have adopted some version of ASME codes, though not necessarily the most recent. In Canada the document is the <a2_0>CAN/CSA B44 Safety Standard<a2_0/>, which was harmonized with the US version in the 2000 edition.[citation needed] In addition, passenger elevators may be required to conform to the requirements of A17.3 for existing elevators where referenced by the local jurisdiction. Passenger elevators are tested using the <a3_0>ASME A17.2 Standard<a3_0/>. The frequency of these tests is mandated by the local jurisdiction, which may be a town, city, state or provincial standard."}
