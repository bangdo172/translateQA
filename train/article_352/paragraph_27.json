Typically, <a2_0>due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor<a2_0/>, hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems. Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, the increasing use of current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as <a3_0>\"soft-start\" contactors<a3_0/>, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern."}
