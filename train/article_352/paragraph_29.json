Single bulkhead cylinders, typically built prior to a <a1_0>1972 ASME A17.1<a1_0/> Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead, were subject to possible catastrophic failure. The code previously permitted only <a2_0>single-bottom<a2_0/> hydraulic cylinders. In the event of a cylinder breach, the fluid loss results in <a3_0>uncontrolled down movement of the elevator<a3_0/>. This creates two significant hazards: being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stops suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator. Because it is impossible to verify the system at all times, the code requires <a4_0>periodic testing of the pressure capability<a4_0/>. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device. One commercially available is known by the marketing name \"LifeJacket\". This is a device which, in the event of an uncontrolled downward acceleration, nondestructively grips the plunger and stops the car. A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate. If a pipe or hose were to break (rupture), the flow rate of the rupture valve will surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of hydraulic fluid, thus stopping the plunger and the car in the down direction."}
