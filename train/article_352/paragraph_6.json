An elevator is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a \"cage\", \"carriage\" or \"car\") mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a \"<a0_0>hoistway<a0_0/>\". In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by <a1_0>steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand<a1_0/>. In a \"traction\" elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved pulley, commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by <a2_0>a counterweight<a2_0/>. Sometimes two elevators are built so that <a3_0>their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions,<a3_0/> and are each other's counterweight."}
