If the person waits, then one will still stop going up. Direction indicators are sometimes etched with <a2_0>arrows or shaped like arrows<a2_0/> and/or use the convention that one that lights up red means \"down\" and green means \"up\". Since the color convention is often undermined or overridden by systems that do not invoke it, it is usually used only in conjunction with other differentiating factors. An example of a place whose elevators use only the color convention <a3_0>to differentiate between directions<a3_0/> is the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, where a single circle can be made to light up green for \"up\" and red for \"down\". Sometimes directions must be inferred by the position of the indicators relative to one another."}
