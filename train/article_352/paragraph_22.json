It is first activated by <a2_0>a key switch on the car operating panel usually labeled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB<a2_0/>'. When this switch is activated <a3_0>the elevator will come to a stop if moving<a3_0/>, car calls will be canceled (and the buttons disabled), and hall calls will be assigned to other elevator cars in the group (or canceled in a single elevator configuration). <a4_0>The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches<a4_0/>, usually located at the highest (to access the top of the car) and lowest (to access the elevator pit) landings. The access key switches will allow the car to move at reduced inspection speed with the hoistway door open. This speed can range from anywhere up to 60% of normal operating speed on most controllers, and is usually defined by local safety codes."}
