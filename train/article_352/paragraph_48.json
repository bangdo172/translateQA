The central element of this attraction is <a1_0>a simulated free-fall achieved through the use of a high-speed elevator system<a1_0/>. For safety reasons, <a2_0>passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing<a2_0/>. Unlike most traction elevators, the elevator car and counterweight are joined using a rail system in a continuous loop running through both the top and the bottom of the drop shaft. This allows the drive motor to pull down on the elevator car from underneath, resulting in <a3_0>downward acceleration greater than that of normal gravity<a3_0/>. The <a4_0>high-speed drive motor<a4_0/> is used to rapidly lift the elevator as well."}
