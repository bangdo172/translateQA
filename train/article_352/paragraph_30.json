The method involves <a1_0>destructive testing<a1_0/> of a segment of the cable. <a2_0>The ends of the segment are frayed, then set in conical zinc molds<a2_0/>. Each end of the segment is then secured in a large, <a3_0>hydraulic stretching machine<a3_0/>. The segment is then placed under increasing load to the point of failure. <a4_0>Data about elasticity, load, and other factors is compiled<a4_0/> and a report is produced. The report is then analyzed to determine whether or not the entire rail is safe to use."}
