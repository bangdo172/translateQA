This makes it easier to control the elevator, as it compensates for <a2_0>the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab<a2_0/>. If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist-way, there is a short length of hoist cable above the car and a long length of compensating cable below the car and vice versa for the counterweight. If the compensation system uses cables, there will be an additional sheave in the pit below the elevator, to guide the cables.
