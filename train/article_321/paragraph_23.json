Because of this, Zinc Oxide used in nuclear reactors as an <a2_0><b6_0>anti-corrosion agent<b6_0/><a2_0/> is depleted of 64Zn before use, this is called depleted zinc oxide. For the same reason, zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons (cobalt is another, better-known salting material). A jacket of isotopically enriched 64Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon, forming a large amount of <b7_0>65Zn<b7_0/> significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon's fallout. Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used. <a3_0>65Zn<a3_0/> is also used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out, or the path and the role of zinc in organisms."}
