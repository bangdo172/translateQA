In stronger alkaline solutions, this hydroxide is dissolved to form <a0_0><b1_0>zincates<b1_0/><a0_0/> ([Zn(OH)4]2\u2212). The nitrate Zn(NO3)\n2, chlorate Zn(ClO3)\n2, sulfate ZnSO\n4, phosphate Zn\n3(PO4)\n2, molybdate ZnMoO\n4, cyanide Zn(CN)\n2, arsenite Zn(AsO2)\n2, arsenate Zn(AsO4)\n2\u00b78H\n2O and the chromate ZnCrO\n4 (one of the few colored zinc compounds) are a few examples of other common inorganic compounds of zinc. One of the simplest examples of an organic compound of zinc is the acetate (Zn(O\n2CCH3)\n2)."}
