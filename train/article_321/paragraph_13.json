Prior to this, only <a1_0><b6_0>calamine<b6_0/><a1_0/> could be used to produce zinc. In 1798, <a2_0><b7_0>Johann Christian Ruberg<b7_0/><a2_0/> improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter. Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium, which processed even more zinc. Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg to twitch. He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect \"<a3_0><b8_0>animal electricity<b8_0/><a3_0/>\". The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani and these discoveries paved the way for <a4_0><b9_0>electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection<b9_0/>."}
