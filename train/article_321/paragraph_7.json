Because of this some of their salts have the same crystal structure and in circumstances where <a2_0><b6_0>ionic radius<b6_0/><a2_0/> is a determining factor zinc and magnesium chemistries have much in common. Otherwise there is little similarity. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and it forms much more stable complexes with <a3_0><b5_0>N- and S-<b5_0/><a3_0/> donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known."}
