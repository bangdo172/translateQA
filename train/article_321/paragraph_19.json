These alloys are marketed under the name <a1_0><b8_0>Zamak<b8_0/><a1_0/>. An example of this is zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes the production of <a2_0><b6_0>small and intricate shapes<b6_0/><a2_0/> possible. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and therefore fast assembly is possible. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name <a3_0><b9_0>Prestal<b9_0/><a3_0/>, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using <a4_0><b7_0>die casts made of ceramics and cement<b7_0/>."}
