A 1998 review concluded that <a0_0><b4_0>zinc oxide<b4_0/><a0_0/>, one of the most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are <a1_0><b5_0>nearly insoluble<b5_0/><a1_0/> and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies which found low plasma zinc concentrations after zinc oxide and zinc carbonate were consumed compared with those seen after consumption of zinc acetate and sulfate salts. However, harmful excessive supplementation is a problem among the relatively affluent, and should probably not exceed <a2_0><b6_0>20 mg/day<b6_0/><a2_0/> in healthy people, although the U.S. National Research Council set a Tolerable Upper Intake of <a3_0><b7_0>40 mg/day<b7_0/><a3_0/>."}
