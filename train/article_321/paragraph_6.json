When compounds in this oxidation state are formed the outer shell s electrons are lost, which yields a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [Ar]3d10. In aqueous solution an octahedral complex, [Zn(H\n2O)6]2+ is the predominant species. <a1_0><b6_0>The volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285 \u00b0C<b6_0/><a1_0/> indicates the formation of Zn\n2Cl\n2, a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state. No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than <a2_0><a4_0>+1 or +2<a4_0/><a2_0/> are known. Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist."}
