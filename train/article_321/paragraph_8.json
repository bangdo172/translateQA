Most zinc(I) compounds contain formally the <a1_0><b5_0>[Zn2]2+<b5_0/><a1_0/> core, which is analogous to the [Hg2]2+ dimeric cation present in mercury(I) compounds. The <a2_0><b6_0>diamagnetic nature of the ion<b6_0/><a2_0/> confirms its dimeric structure. The first zinc(I) compound containing the Zn\u2014Zn bond, (\u03b75-C5Me5)2Zn2, is also the first dimetallocene. The [Zn2]2+ ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc metal and zinc(II), and has only been obtained as a <a3_0><b7_0>yellow glass<b7_0/><a3_0/> formed by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2."}
