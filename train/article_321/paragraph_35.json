Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent <a1_0><b5_0>polio infections<b5_0/><a1_0/>. On June 16, 2009, the FDA said that consumers should stop using <a2_0><b6_0>zinc-based intranasal cold products<b6_0/><a2_0/> and ordered their removal from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it. Recent research suggests that the <b7_0>topical <a3_0>antimicrobial zinc pyrithione<b7_0/><a3_0/> is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes."}
