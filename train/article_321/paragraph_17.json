For example, <a1_0>cathodic protection<a1_0/> of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline.[note 2] Zinc is also used to cathodically <a2_0><b5_0>protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion<b5_0/><a2_0/>. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder <a3_0><b7_0>will slowly corrode<b7_0/>, whereas the rudder stays unattacked<a3_0/>. Other similar uses include a plug of zinc attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship."}
