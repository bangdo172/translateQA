Major <a0_0><b4_0>plant sources<b4_0/><a0_0/> of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soyfoods, nuts, peas, and seeds. However, <a1_0><b5_0>phytates<b5_0/><a1_0/> in many whole-grains and fiber in many foods may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. The zinc chelator phytate, found <b6_0>in <a2_0>seeds and cereal bran<b6_0/>,<a2_0/> can contribute to zinc malabsorption. There is some evidence to suggest that more than the US RDA (15 mg) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose <a3_0><b7_0>diet is high in phytates<b7_0/>,<a3_0/> such as some vegetarians. These considerations must be balanced against the fact that there is a paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers, and the most widely used indicator, plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge."}
