It is the first element of group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to <a2_0><a7_0><b12_0>magnesium<b12_0/><a7_0/><a2_0/>: its ion is of similar size and its only common oxidation state is <a3_0>+2<a3_0/>. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has <a4_0>five<a4_0/> stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is <a8_0><b13_0>sphalerite<b13_0/><a8_0/> (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc production includes froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using <a9_0><b14_0>electricity<b14_0/><a9_0/> (electrowinning)."}
