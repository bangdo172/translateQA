One of the major theoretical innovations made by the <b5_0>Salon Cubists<b5_0/>, independently of Picasso and Braque, was that of simultaneity, drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of Henri Poincar\u00e9, Ernst Mach, Charles Henry, Maurice Princet, and <b2_0>Henri Bergson<b2_0/>. With simultaneity, the <b3_0>concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions<b3_0/> was comprehensively challenged. Linear perspective developed during the Renaissance was vacated. The subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at a moment in time, but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other."}
