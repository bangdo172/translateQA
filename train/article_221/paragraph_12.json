Prior to 1914, Picasso, Braque, Gris and L\u00e9ger (to a lesser extent) gained the support of a single committed art dealer in Paris, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who guaranteed them an annual income for the exclusive right to buy their works. Kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of connoisseurs. His support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy. Picasso worked in <a0_0><a1_0><b3_0><b4_0>Montmartre<b4_0/><b3_0/><a1_0/><a0_0/> until 1912, while Braque and Gris remained there until after the First World War. L\u00e9ger was based in <a2_0><b5_0>Montparnasse<b5_0/><a2_0/>."}
