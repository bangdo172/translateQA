Other Cubists, by contrast, especially Franti\u0161ek Kupka, and those considered Orphists by Apollinaire (Delaunay, L\u00e9ger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka\u2019s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, <a0_0><b3_0>Amorpha-Fugue \u00e0 deux couleurs and Amorpha chromatique chaude<b3_0/><a0_0/>, were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled <a1_0><b4_0>Simultaneous Windows<b4_0/>,<a1_0/> followed by a series entitled Formes Circulaires, in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In <a2_0><b5_0>1913\u201314<b5_0/><a2_0/> <b6_0>L\u00e9ger<b6_0/> produced a series entitled Contrasts of Forms, giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in Les Peintres cubistes (1913), writing of a new \"pure\" painting in which the subject was vacated. But in spite of his use of the term Orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category."}
