As American poet <a1_0><b5_0>Kenneth Rexroth<b5_0/><a1_0/> explains, Cubism in poetry \"is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made self-sufficient by its rigorous architecture. This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada.\" Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of Dada and Surrealism was profound; Louis Aragon, founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, \u00c9luard and himself, Reverdy was \"our immediate elder, the exemplary poet.\" Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets <a2_0><b6_0>John Ashbery and Ron Padgett<b6_0/><a2_0/> have recently produced new translations of Reverdy's work. <b7_0>Wallace Stevens<b7_0/>' \"<a3_0>Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird<a3_0/>\" is also said to demonstrate how cubism's multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry."}
