Early <a2_0><b6_0>Futurist<b6_0/><a2_0/> paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time, also called multiple perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity, while <a3_0><b7_0>Constructivism<b7_0/><a3_0/> was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements. Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life."}
