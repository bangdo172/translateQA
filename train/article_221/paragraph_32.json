Thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and sculpture was applied as part of \"a profound reorientation towards a changed world\". The Cubo-Futurist ideas of <a0_0><b5_0>Filippo Tommaso Marinetti<b5_0/><a0_0/> influenced attitudes in avant-garde architecture. The influential De Stijl movement embraced the aesthetic principles of <a1_0>Neo-plasticism<a1_0/> developed by <a2_0>Piet Mondrian<a2_0/> under the influence of Cubism in Paris. De Stijl was also linked by <a3_0>Gino Severini<a3_0/> to Cubist theory through the writings of <b6_0>Albert Gleizes<b6_0/>. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of <b7_0>industrial application<b7_0/>\u2014which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914\u2014was left to the founders of Purism, Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant and Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier,) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published Apr\u00e8s le cubisme in 1918. Le Corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture. Between <b8_0>1918 and 1922<b8_0/>, Le Corbusier concentrated his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, <b9_0>Le Corbusier and <a4_0>his cousin Jeanneret<a4_0/> opened a studio<b9_0/> in Paris at 35 rue de S\u00e8vres. His theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects."}
