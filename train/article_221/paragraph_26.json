According to Douglas Cooper: \"<a1_0>The first true Cubist sculpture<a1_0/> was Picasso's impressive Woman's Head, modeled in 1909\u201310, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time.\" These positive/negative reversals were ambitiously exploited by Alexander Archipenko in 1912\u201313, for example in <a2_0><b6_0><b7_0>Woman Walking<b7_0/><b6_0/><a2_0/>. Joseph Csaky, after Archipenko, was the first sculptor in Paris to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onwards. They were followed by Raymond Duchamp-Villon and then in 1914 by Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Laurens and Ossip Zadkine."}
