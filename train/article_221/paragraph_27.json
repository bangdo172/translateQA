This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant <a3_0>between <b7_0>1917 and 1920<b7_0/><a3_0/>, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector L\u00e9once Rosenberg. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic Maurice Raynal (fr) as <a0_0>'<b4_0>crystal<b4_0/>' Cubism<a0_0/>. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of World War I\u2014such as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, the occult, and <a1_0><b5_0>Henri Bergson's<b5_0/><a1_0/> concept of duration\u2014had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference."}
