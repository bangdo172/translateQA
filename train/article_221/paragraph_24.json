These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. <a1_0><b4_0>L\u00e9ger<a1_0/>\u2019s<b4_0/> The Wedding, also shown at the <b7_0>Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants<b7_0/> in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force.
