Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed. Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the \"Salle 41\" artists, e.g., Francis Picabia; the brothers Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp, who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the Section d'Or (or the Puteaux Group); the sculptors Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky and Ossip Zadkine as well as Jacques Lipchitz and Henri Laurens; and painters such as Louis Marcoussis, Roger de La Fresnaye, Franti\u0161ek Kupka, Diego Rivera, L\u00e9opold Survage, Auguste Herbin, Andr\u00e9 Lhote, Gino Severini (after 1916), Mar\u00eda Blanchard (after 1916) and Georges Valmier (after 1918). More fundamentally, Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper's terms were \"later undermined by interpretations of the work of <a4_0><b9_0>Picasso, Braque, Gris and L\u00e9ger<b9_0/><a4_0/> that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation.\""}
