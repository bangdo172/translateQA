After World War I, with the support given by the dealer <a1_0>L\u00e9once Rosenberg<a1_0/>, Cubism returned as a central issue for artists, and continued as such until the mid-1920s when its avant-garde status was rendered questionable by the emergence of geometric abstraction and Surrealism in Paris. Many Cubists, including Picasso, Braque, Gris, L\u00e9ger, Gleizes, and Metzinger, while developing other styles, returned periodically to Cubism, even well after 1925. Cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s in the work of the American Stuart Davis and the Englishman Ben Nicholson. In France, however, <b6_0>Cubism<b6_0/> experienced a decline beginning in about 1925. <b5_0>L\u00e9once Rosenberg<b5_0/> exhibited not only the artists stranded by Kahnweiler\u2019s exile but others including Laurens, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Gleizes, Csaky, Herbin and Severini. In <a2_0><b7_0>1918<b7_0/><a2_0/> Rosenberg presented a series of Cubist exhibitions at his Galerie de l\u2019Effort Moderne in <a3_0><b8_0>Paris<b8_0/><a3_0/>. Attempts were made by Louis Vauxcelles to claim that Cubism was dead, but these exhibitions, along with a well-organized Cubist show at the 1920 Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants and a revival of the Salon de la Section d\u2019Or in the same year, demonstrated it was still alive."}
