The occasional return to classicism\u2014figurative work either exclusively or alongside Cubist work\u2014experienced by many artists during this period (called Neoclassicism) has been linked to the tendency to evade the realities of the war and also to the cultural dominance of a classical or Latin image of France during and immediately following the war. Cubism after 1918 can be <b6_0>seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards <a2_0><b4_0>conservatism<b6_0/><b4_0/><a2_0/> in both French society and culture. Yet, <b5_0>Cubism<b5_0/> itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as Gris and Metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as Braque, L\u00e9ger and Gleizes. Cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition. Its theoretical purity made it a gauge against which such diverse tendencies as Realism or Naturalism, Dada, Surrealism and abstraction could be compared."}
