This familiar explanation \"fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when Picasso's new painting developed.\" Between <a1_0><b5_0>1905 and 1908<b5_0/>,<a1_0/> a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Russia. The Impressionists had used a <a3_0><b7_0>double point of view<b7_0/><a3_0/>, and both <a2_0><b6_0>Les Nabis and the Symbolists<b6_0/><a2_0/> (who also admired C\u00e9zanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms. Neo-Impressionist structure and subject matter, most notably to be seen in the works of Georges Seurat (e.g., Parade de Cirque, Le Chahut and Le Cirque), was another important influence. There were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought."}
