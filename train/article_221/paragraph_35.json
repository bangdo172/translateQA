This should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called diamond cut, or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late Gothic architecture. In this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. The grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a <b6_0>three-dimensional<b6_0/> form. Thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. <a1_0><b4_0>hexagonal<b4_0/><a1_0/> windows. Czech Cubist architects also designed Cubist furniture."}
