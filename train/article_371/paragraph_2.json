He favored a nonsectarian university. In <b5_0>1854<b5_0/>, the Board of Trustees changed the name to \"<a1_0>Washington Institute<a1_0/>\" in honor of <b8_0>George Washington<b8_0/>. Naming the University after the nation's first president, only seven years before the American Civil War and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. <a2_0>The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri<a2_0/>. In <a3_0>1856<a3_0/>, the University amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in <a4_0>1976<a4_0/>, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the nearly two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name."}
