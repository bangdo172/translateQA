The renowned Philadelphia firm <a1_0>Cope & Stewardson<a1_0/> won unanimously with its plan for a row of Collegiate Gothic quadrangles inspired by Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The cornerstone of the first building, Busch Hall, was laid on <a2_0><b6_0><b7_0><b8_0>October 20, 1900<b8_0/><b7_0/><b6_0/><a2_0/>. The construction of <a3_0>Brookings Hall, Ridgley, and Cupples<a3_0/> began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 <a4_0>to accommodate the 1904 World's Fair and Olympics<a4_0/>. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson\u2019s original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day."}
