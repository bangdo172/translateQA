The most widely accepted way of comparing brain sizes across species is the so-called <a0_0>encephalization quotient (EQ)<a0_0/>, which takes into account the nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the <a1_0>7-to-8 range<a1_0/>, while most other primates have an EQ in the <a2_0>2-to-3<a2_0/> range. Dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower."}
