The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between <a3_0>2% and 8%<a3_0/> of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher\u2014in humans it rises to <a1_0>20\u201325%<a1_0/>. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of <a0_0>glucose (i.e., blood sugar<a0_0/>), but <a2_0>ketones<a2_0/> provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids."}
