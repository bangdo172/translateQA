This concept formed the basis of the field of <a1_0>cybernetics<a1_0/>, and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience. The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in <a2_0>John von Neumann's<a2_0/> <a3_0>1958<a3_0/> book, The Computer and the Brain. Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism."}
