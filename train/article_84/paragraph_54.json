In humans, the effects of <a3_0>strokes<a3_0/> and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving <a4_0>rats<a4_0/>, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior."}
