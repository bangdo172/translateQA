Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, but it can be hardened by immersion in <a1_0>alcohol<a1_0/> or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called <a2_0>grey matter, with a <a4_0>dark color<a4_0/>, separated by areas of white matter<a2_0/>, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a <a3_0>microscope<a3_0/>, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another."}
