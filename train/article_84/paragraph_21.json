The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. <a0_0>The cerebral cortex<a0_0/> is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the <a1_0>pallium<a1_0/>. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called <a2_0>neocortex or isocortex<a2_0/>. Several areas at the edge of the <a3_0>neocortex<a3_0/>, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates."}
