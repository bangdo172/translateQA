Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Theorists dating back to <a2_0>Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal<a2_0/> argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In <a0_0>1971<a0_0/> Tim Bliss and Terje L\u00f8mo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. <a1_0>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor<a1_0/> (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process."}
