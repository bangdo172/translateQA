Glial cells (also known as <a1_0>glia or neuroglia<a1_0/>) come in several types, and perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain. The property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals by means of an axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called <a3_0>action potentials<a3_0/>, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of <a4_0>1\u2013100 meters per second<a4_0/>. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10\u2013100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials."}
