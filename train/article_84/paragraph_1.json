This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as <a1_0>reflexes<a1_0/> can be mediated by the <a2_0>spinal cord or peripheral ganglia<a2_0/>, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain."}
