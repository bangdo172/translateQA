The SCN contains the body's central biological clock. Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours, circadian rhythms: these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of \"clock genes\". The SCN continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution, but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves, through <a4_0>the <a3_0>retinohypothalamic tract<a3_0/> (RHT<a4_0/>), that allows daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock."}
