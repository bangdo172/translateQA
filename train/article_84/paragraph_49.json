In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures, at the heart of which lie the <a0_0>basal ganglia<a0_0/>, a set of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain. There is substantial evidence that the basal ganglia are the central site at which <a1_0>decisions<a1_0/> are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. <a3_0>The reward mechanism<a3_0/> is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter <a2_0>dopamine<a2_0/> plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced."}
