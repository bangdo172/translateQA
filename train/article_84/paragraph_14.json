Sharks appeared about <a2_0>450 Mya<a2_0/>, amphibians about 400 Mya, reptiles about 350 Mya, and mammals about <a4_0>200 Mya<a4_0/>. Each species has an equally long evolutionary history, but the brains of modern hagfishes, lampreys, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence. All of these brains contain the same set of basic anatomical components, but many are rudimentary in the hagfish, whereas in mammals the foremost part <a3_0>(the telencephalon<a3_0/>) is greatly elaborated and expanded."}
