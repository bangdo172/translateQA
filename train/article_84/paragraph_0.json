Only a few invertebrates such as <a4_0>sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts<a4_0/> and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. <a1_0>The brain<a1_0/> is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain <a2_0>15\u201333 billion<a2_0/> neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called <a3_0>axons<a3_0/>, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells."}
