A single axon may make as many as <a2_0>several thousand<a2_0/> synaptic connections with other cells. When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to <a1_0>receptor molecules<a1_0/> in the membrane of the target cell."}
