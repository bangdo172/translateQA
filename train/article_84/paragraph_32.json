When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using <a0_0>electroencephalography<a0_0/> (EEG) or <a1_0>magnetoencephalography<a1_0/> (MEG). <a2_0>EEG<a2_0/> recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show <a3_0>large slow delta waves<a3_0/> during sleep, <a4_0>faster alpha waves<a4_0/> when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology."}
