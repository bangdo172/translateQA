All bilaterians are thought to have descended from a common ancestor that appeared early in the Cambrian period, <a2_0>485-540 million years ago<a2_0/>, and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape of a simple tubeworm with a segmented body. At a schematic level, that basic worm-shape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians, including vertebrates. The fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (<a3_0>a ganglion<a3_0/>) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain. The brain is small and simple in some species, such as nematode worms; in other species, including vertebrates, it is the most complex organ in the body. Some types of worms, such as <a4_0>leeches<a4_0/>, also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord, known as a \"tail brain\"."}
