The brain of a shark shows the basic components in a straightforward way, but in <a0_0>teleost fishes<a0_0/> (the great majority of existing fish species), the forebrain has become \"everted\", like a sock turned inside out. In birds, there are also major changes in forebrain structure. These distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from one species with those of another species."}
