Neuroanatomists study <a1_0>the large-scale structure of the brain<a1_0/> as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional <a2_0>neuroanatomy<a2_0/> uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior."}
