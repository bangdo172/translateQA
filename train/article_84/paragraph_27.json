There are, however, a few areas where new <a4_0>neurons continue to be generated throughout life<a4_0/>. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb, which is involved in the <a1_0>sense of smell<a1_0/>, and the <a2_0>dentate gyrus of the hippocampus<a2_0/>, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories.
