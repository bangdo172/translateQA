At the lowest level are motor areas in <a0_0><a1_0>the medulla and pons<a1_0/>,<a0_0/> which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for <a2_0>coordinating movements of the arms and legs<a2_0/>. At a higher level yet is the <a3_0>primary motor cortex<a3_0/>, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the <a4_0>pyramidal tract.<a4_0/> This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum."}
