The human brain is provided with information about light, sound, the chemical composition of the atmosphere, temperature, head orientation, limb position, the chemical composition of the bloodstream, and more. In other animals additional senses may be present, such as the infrared heat-sense of <a1_0>snakes<a1_0/>, the magnetic field sense of some <a2_0>birds<a2_0/>, or the electric field sense of some types of <a3_0>fish<a3_0/>. Moreover, other animals may develop existing sensory systems in new ways, such as the adaptation by <a0_0>bats<a0_0/> of the auditory sense into a form of sonar. One way or another, all of these sensory modalities are initially detected by specialized sensors that project signals into the brain."}
