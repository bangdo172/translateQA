The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to <a3_0>the pituitary gland<a3_0/>, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into <a4_0>the bloodstream<a4_0/>, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity."}
