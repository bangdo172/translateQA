Living brain tissue is <a0_0>pinkish<a0_0/> on the outside and mostly <a1_0>white<a1_0/> on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called <a2_0>meninges<a2_0/> that separate <a3_0>the skull<a3_0/> from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The <a4_0>cells in the blood vessel walls<a4_0/> are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood\u2013brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain)."}
