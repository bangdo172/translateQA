The essential function of the brain is <a3_0>cell-to-cell communication<a3_0/>, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately <a0_0>100 trillion synapses;<a0_0/> even the brain of a fruit fly contains <a1_0>several million<a1_0/>. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are <a2_0>excitatory<a2_0/> (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory."}
