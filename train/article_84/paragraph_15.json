The relationship between brain size, body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species. As a rule, brain size increases with body size, but not in a simple linear proportion. In general, smaller animals tend to have larger brains, measured as a fraction of body size. For mammals, the relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law with an exponent of about <a1_0>0.75<a1_0/>. This formula describes the central tendency, but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree, in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior. For example, <a2_0>primates<a2_0/> have brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts. Predators tend to have <a0_0>larger<a0_0/> brains than their prey, relative to body size."}
