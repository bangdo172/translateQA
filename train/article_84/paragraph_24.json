The visual processing network of primates includes at least <a0_0>30<a0_0/> distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy <a1_0>more than half<a1_0/> of the total surface of the primate neocortex. The <a2_0>prefrontal cortex<a2_0/> carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for <a3_0>primates<a3_0/> than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain."}
