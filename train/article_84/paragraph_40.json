The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals are sent to the <a2_0>cerebral cortex<a2_0/>, where they are processed to extract biologically relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems."}
