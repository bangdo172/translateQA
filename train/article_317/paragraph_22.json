This has already been done for the metre, which is defined in terms of a fixed value of the speed of light. The most urgent unit on the list for redefinition is <a0_0><b4_0>the kilogram<b4_0/><a0_0/>, whose value has been fixed for all science (since 1889) by the mass of a small <a1_0><b5_0>cylinder<b5_0/><a1_0/> of <a2_0><b8_0>platinum\u2013iridium<b8_0/><a2_0/> alloy kept <a3_0><b7_0>in a vault just outside Paris<b7_0/><a3_0/>. While nobody knows if <b6_0>the mass of the International Prototype Kilogram<b6_0/> has changed since 1889 \u2013 the value 1 kg of its mass expressed in kilograms is by definition unchanged and therein lies one of the problems \u2013 it is known that over such a timescale the many similar Pt\u2013Ir alloy cylinders kept in national laboratories around the world, have changed their relative mass by several tens of parts per million, however carefully they are stored, and the more so the more they have been taken out and used as mass standards. A change of several tens of micrograms in one kilogram is equivalent to the current uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant in SI units."}
