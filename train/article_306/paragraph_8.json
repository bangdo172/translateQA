This encourages the use of tremolo (<a2_0><b10_0>rapid <b6_0>picking<b6_0/> of one or more pairs of strings<b10_0/><a2_0/>) to create sustained notes or chords. The mandolin's <a3_0><b11_0>paired strings<b11_0/><a3_0/> facilitate this technique: the plectrum (<a4_0><b12_0>pick<b12_0/><a4_0/>) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately, providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would."}
