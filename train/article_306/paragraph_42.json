Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works. Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in <a1_0><b6_0>Japan and Germany<b6_0/><a1_0/>, but also exist throughout the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments, or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces. The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of: <a2_0><b7_0>first and second mandolins<b7_0/>,<a2_0/> mandolas (either octave mandolas, tuned an octave below the mandolin, or tenor mandolas, tuned like the viola), mandocellos (tuned like the <a4_0>cello<a4_0/>), and bass instruments (conventional string bass or, rarely, mandobasses). Smaller ensembles, such as quartets composed of <a3_0><b8_0>two mandolins, mandola, and mandocello<b8_0/>,<a3_0/> may also be found."}
