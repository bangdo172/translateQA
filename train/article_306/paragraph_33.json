In fact, along with all the other musical forms the mandolin is involved with, the mandolin ensemble (groups usually arranged like the string section of a modern symphony orchestra, with first mandolins, second mandolins, mandolas, mandocellos, mando-basses, and guitars, and sometimes supplemented by other instruments) continues to grow in popularity. Since the mid-nineties, several public-school <a0_0><b4_0>mandolin-based guitar programs<b4_0/><a0_0/> have blossomed around the country, including <a1_0><b5_0>Fretworks Mandolin and Guitar Orchestra<b5_0/><a1_0/>, the first of its kind. The national organization, Classical Mandolin Society of America, founded by <a2_0><b6_0>Norman Levine<b6_0/><a2_0/>, represents these groups. Prominent modern mandolinists and composers for mandolin in the classical music tradition include <a3_0><b7_0>Samuel Firstman<b7_0/>, Howard Fry, Rudy Cipolla<a3_0/>, Dave Apollon, Neil Gladd, Evan Marshall, Marilynn Mair and Mark Davis (the Mair-Davis Duo), Brian Israel, David Evans, Emanuil Shynkman, Radim Zenkl, David Del Tredici and Ernst Krenek."}
