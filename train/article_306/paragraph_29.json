Ironically, this ensemble did not play mandolins but rather bandurrias, which are also small, double-strung instruments that resemble the mandolin. The success of the Figaro Spanish Students spawned other groups who imitated their musical style and costumes. An Italian musician, Carlo Curti, hastily started a musical ensemble after seeing the Figaro Spanish Students perform; his group of Italian born Americans called themselves the \"<a3_0><b8_0>Original Spanish Students<b8_0/><a3_0/>,\" counting on the American public to not know <a4_0>the <b9_0>difference between the Spanish bandurrias and Italian mandolins<b9_0/><a4_0/>. The imitators' use of mandolins helped to generate enormous public interest in an instrument previously relatively unknown in the United States."}
