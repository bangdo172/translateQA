One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish-American punk rock band <a1_0><b6_0>Dropkick Murphys<b6_0/><a1_0/>. In addition to electric guitar, bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes. The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor. The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"<a2_0><b7_0>Losing My Religion<b7_0/><a2_0/>\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs. The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made frequent use of the mandolin, most notably on the Black Crowes song \"Locust Street.\" Armenian American rock group <a3_0>System of A Down<a3_0/> makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Pop punk band Green Day has used a mandolin in several occasions, especially on their 2000 album, Warning. Boyd Tinsley, violin player of the Dave Matthews Band has been using an electric mandolin since 2005. Frontman Colin Meloy and guitarist Chris Funk of The Decemberists regularly employ the mandolin in the band's music. Nancy Wilson, rhythm guitarist of Heart, uses a mandolin in Heart's song \"Dream of the Archer\" from the album Little Queen, as well as in Heart's cover of Led Zeppelin's song \"The Battle of Evermore.\" \"Show Me Heaven\" by Maria McKee, the theme song to the film <a4_0>Days of Thunder<a4_0/>, prominently features a mandolin."}
