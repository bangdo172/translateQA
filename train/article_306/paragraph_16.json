This is especially true of <b5_0>violin<b5_0/> music, since the mandolin has the same tuning of the <a0_0>violin<a0_0/>. Following its invention and early development in Italy the mandolin spread throughout the European continent. The instrument was primarily used in a <a1_0><b6_0>classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras<b6_0/><a1_0/>, so called Estudiantinas or in Germany Zupforchestern appearing in many cities. Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family local traditions appeared outside of Europe in the Americas and in Japan. Travelling mandolin virtuosi like <a3_0><b8_0>Giuseppe Pettine, Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri<b8_0/><a3_0/> contributed to the mandolin becoming a \"fad\" instrument in the <a2_0><b7_0>early 20th century<b7_0/><a2_0/>. This \"mandolin craze\" was fading by the <a4_0><b9_0>1930s<b9_0/><a4_0/>, but just as this practice was falling into disuse, the mandolin found a new niche in American country, old-time music, bluegrass and folk music. More recently, the Baroque and Classical mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in Early music, with media attention to classical players such as Israeli Avi Avital, Italian Carlo Aonzo and American Joseph Brent."}
