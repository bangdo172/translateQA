In Indian classical music and Indian light music, the mandolin, which bears little resemblance to the European mandolin, is usually tuned <a1_0><b6_0>E-B-E-B<b6_0/>.<a1_0/> As there is no concept of <a2_0><b7_0>absolute pitch<b7_0/><a2_0/> in Indian classical music, any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used. Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is <a3_0><b8_0>C-G-C-G<a3_0/>,<b8_0/> which corresponds to Sa-Pa-Sa-Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style. This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music. This type of mandolin is also used in <a4_0><b9_0>Bhangra<b9_0/><a4_0/>, dance music popular in Punjabi culture."}
