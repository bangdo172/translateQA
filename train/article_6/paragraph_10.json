(USGS, using the Modified Mercalli intensity scale (CC), also placed maximum intensity at XI, \"<a3_0>very disastrous<a3_0/>\".) Two south-west-north-east stripes of liedu XI are centered around <a4_0>Yingxiu, Wenchuan<a4_0/> (the town closest to the epicenter of the main quake) and Beichuan (the town repeatedly struck by strong aftershocks including one registering MS 6.1 on Aug 1, 2008), both in Sichuan Province, occupying a total of 2,419 km2. The Yingxiu liedu-XI zone is about 66 km long and 20 km wide along Wenchuan\u2013Dujiangyan\u2013Pengzhou; the Beichuan liedu-XI zone is about 82 km long and 15 km wide along An County\u2013Beichuan\u2013Pingwu. The area with liedu X (comparable to X on EMS, \"destructive\" and X on MM, \"disastrous\") spans 3,144 km2. The area affected by earthquakes exceeding liedu VI totals 440,442 km2, occupying an oval 936 km long and 596 km wide, spanning three provinces and one autonomous region."}
