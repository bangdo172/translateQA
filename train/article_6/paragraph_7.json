He pointed out that the <a3_0>shallowness of the epicenter<a3_0/> and the density of population greatly increased the severity of the earthquake. Teruyuki Kato, a seismologist at the University of Tokyo, said that the seismic waves of the quake traveled a long distance without losing their power because of the <a5_0>firmness of the terrain<a5_0/> in central China. According to reports from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, the earthquake tremors lasted for \"about two or three minutes\"."}
