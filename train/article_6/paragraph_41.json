Using data from the Intermagnet Lanzhou geomagnetic observatory, geologists Lazo Pekevski from the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje in Macedonia and Strachimir Mavrodiev from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences attempted to establish a \"<a2_0>time prediction method<a2_0/>\" through collecting <a3_0>statistics<a3_0/> on geomagnetism with tidal gravitational potential. Using this method, they were said to have predicted <a1_0>the time of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake<a1_0/> with an accuracy of \u00b11 day. The same study, however, acknowledges the limitation of earthquake prediction models, and does not mention that the location of the quake could be accurately predicted."}
