The resulting genes (<a2_0>paralogs<a2_0/>) may then diverge in sequence and in function. Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family. Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent a major source of evolutionary biodiversity. Sometimes, gene duplication may result in a <a3_0>nonfunctional<a3_0/> copy of a gene, or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function; such nonfunctional genes are called <a4_0>pseudogenes<a4_0/>.:7.6"}
