These act <a0_0>by binding to transcription factors<a0_0/> which then cause <a1_0>the DNA to loop<a1_0/> so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription <a2_0>by binding an activator protein<a2_0/> which then <a3_0>helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter<a3_0/>; conversely <a4_0>silencers bind repressor proteins<a4_0/> and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase."}
