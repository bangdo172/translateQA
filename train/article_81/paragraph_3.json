From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where <a1_0>n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas<a1_0/>. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of <a4_0>discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics<a4_0/>. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate <a2_0>independent assortment<a2_0/>, <a3_0>the distinction between dominant and recessive traits<a3_0/>, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance."}
