Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to <a1_0>different phenotypic traits<a1_0/>. A gene's most common allele is called <a2_0>the wild type<a2_0/>, and rare alleles are called <a3_0>mutants<a3_0/>. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and <a4_0>genetic drift<a4_0/>. The wild-type allele is not necessarily the ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily fitter."}
