In eukaryotes, <a2_0>transcription occurs <a3_0>in the nucleus<a3_0/><a2_0/>, where the cell's DNA is stored. The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase is known as <a4_0>the primary transcript<a4_0/> and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. Alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.:7.5"}
