This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called DNA replication.:5.2 The copies are made by specialized enzymes known as <a2_0>DNA polymerases<a2_0/>, which \"read\" one strand of the double-helical DNA, known as the template strand, and synthesize a new complementary strand. <a3_0>Because the DNA double helix is held together by base pairing<a3_0/>, the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement; hence only one strand needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy. The process of DNA replication is <a4_0>semiconservative<a4_0/>; that is, the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand of DNA.:5.2"}
