Simple single-celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA, whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms, including humans, contain an absolute majority of <a2_0>DNA without an identified function<a2_0/>. This DNA has often been referred to as \"junk DNA\". However, more recent analyses suggest that, although protein-coding DNA makes up <a3_0>barely 2%<a3_0/> of the human genome, <a4_0>about 80%<a4_0/> of the bases in the genome may be expressed, so the term \"junk DNA\" may be a misnomer."}
