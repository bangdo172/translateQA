Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (<a1_0>synonymous mutations<a1_0/>). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g. <a2_0>conservative mutations<a2_0/>). Many mutations, however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. <a3_0>Genetic disorders<a3_0/> are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual, or can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to <a4_0>adaptive evolution<a4_0/>.:7.6"}
