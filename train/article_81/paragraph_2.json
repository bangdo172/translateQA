For example, regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from <a0_0>its coding regions<a0_0/>, and coding regions can be split into <a1_0>several exons<a1_0/>. Some viruses store their genome in <a2_0>RNA<a2_0/> instead of DNA and some gene products are <a3_0>functional non-coding RNAs<a3_0/>. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is <a4_0>any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product<a4_0/> or by regulation of gene expression."}
