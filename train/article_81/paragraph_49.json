Initial theoretical predictions of the number of human genes were as high as <a1_0>2,000,000<a1_0/>. Early experimental measures indicated there to be 50,000\u2013100,000 transcribed genes (expressed sequence tags). Subsequently, the sequencing in the Human Genome Project indicated that many of these transcripts were <a2_0>alternative variants<a2_0/> of the same genes, and the total number of protein-coding genes was revised down to ~20,000 with <a3_0>13<a3_0/> genes encoded on the mitochondrial genome. Of the human genome, only <a4_0>1\u20132%<a4_0/> consists of protein-coding genes, with the remainder being 'noncoding' DNA such as introns, retrotransposons, and noncoding RNAs."}
