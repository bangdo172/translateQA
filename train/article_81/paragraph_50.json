This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients and the absence of <a1_0>environmental stress<a1_0/>. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated <a2_0>250\u2013400<a2_0/> genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. <a3_0>Half<a3_0/> of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at <a4_0>1000 genes<a4_0/> (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes)."}
