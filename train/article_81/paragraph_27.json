The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand <a3_0>because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand<a3_0/>. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called <a4_0>an RNA polymerase<a4_0/>, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.:7"}
