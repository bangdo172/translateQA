This has <a1_0>no effect<a1_0/> if the alleles on the chromatids are the same, but results in <a2_0>reassortment of otherwise linked alleles<a2_0/> if they are different.:5.5 The Mendelian principle of <a3_0>independent assortment<a3_0/> asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that <a4_0>a crossover point<a4_0/> will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage."}
