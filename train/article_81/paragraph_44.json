Most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time <a2_0>by neutral molecular evolution<a2_0/>. Additionally, any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge at a different rate. Genes under <a3_0>stabilizing<a3_0/> selection are constrained and so change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more rapidly. The sequence differences between genes can be used for <a4_0>phylogenetic<a4_0/> analyses to study how those genes have evolved and how the organisms they come from are related."}
