The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, <a3_0>via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA)<a3_0/>. Each tRNA has <a4_0>three<a4_0/> unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must folds to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.:3"}
