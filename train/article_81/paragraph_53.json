Since <a1_0>the 1970s<a1_0/>, a variety of techniques have been developed to specifically add, remove and edit genes in an organism. Recently developed genome engineering techniques use <a2_0>engineered nuclease enzymes<a2_0/> to create <a3_0>targeted<a3_0/> DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired.
