Regulatory regions of a gene such as <a0_0>enhancers<a0_0/> do not necessarily have to be close to the coding sequence on the linear molecule <a1_0>because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity<a1_0/>. Similarly, <a2_0>a gene's introns<a2_0/> can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely <a4_0>different chromosomes<a4_0/> and operate <a3_0>in trans<a3_0/> to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome."}
