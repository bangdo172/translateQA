The structure of DNA was studied by <a1_0>Rosalind Franklin<a1_0/> using X-ray crystallography, which led <a2_0>James D. Watson and Francis Crick<a2_0/> to publish a model of the double-stranded DNA molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication. Collectively, this body of research established the central dogma of molecular biology, which states that proteins are translated from RNA, which is transcribed from DNA. This dogma has since been shown to have exceptions, such as <a3_0>reverse transcription in retroviruses<a3_0/>. The modern study of genetics at the level of DNA is known as <a4_0>molecular genetics<a4_0/>."}
